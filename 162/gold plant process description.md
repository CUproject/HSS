## Vermicompost
Vermicompost (vermi-compost) is the product of the decomposition process using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast.This process is called vermicomposting, while the rearing of worms for this purpose is called vermiculture.

After the gold ore has been removed from the earth using mining equipment, it is sent to a gold processing plant. The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process.

gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms
