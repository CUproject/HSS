Feb 11, 2021As a general rule, there should be less than 25% of clinker that is below 1mm in size. Coarse clinker is more of an issue for ball mills. Some cement groups use a formula, such as Bond's, to calculate the maximum ball size required in a ball mill, based on the average size of the clinker feed. However, one drawback with this approach is that

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

The cement manufacturing process includes the quarry, raw meal preparation, preheating of raw meal, kiln, clinker cooling, grinding, storage, and dispatch. In this process the calcium carbonate is heated to 900°C to decompose into calcium oxide (CaO, lime), and CO 2 is generated in the calcination process.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process - Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are
