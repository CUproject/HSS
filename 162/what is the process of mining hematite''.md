In Asia, a great deal of mining for hematite ore is done in China. Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite deposit and the Dongye hematite deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Hematite - Mining Fundamentals
Hematite can also occur as a result of volcanic activity. Clay-sized hematite crystals occur as a secondary mineral along with oxyhydroxides, such as goethite, or other iron oxides as a result of the weathering process in soil. The most common deposits of hematite are sedimentary deposits, such as the Lake Superior district in North America.

## Re: How is Hematite mined? - MadSci
Typically, hematite is mined by open pit mining. Overburden is removed, then the ore is mined from an ever-deepening hole. The mineral and rock is first stripped by blasting the rock with explosives and removing it with enormous trucks - with capacities over 150 tons. The ratio of mineral to rock can be quite large - up to 1.5 to 1 for hematite.
