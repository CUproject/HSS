## Ore Dilution & Recovery in Mining - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
Ore Dilution & Recovery in Mining. Recovery and dilution usually are interrelated; with some methods of stoping a high recovery involves contamination of the ore from the walls or capping, and often clean ore can be obtained only by leaving some ore in the mine. In open-stope mines the greatest loss of ore is that tied up in pillars left for

## Steel manufacturing process pptedhome
Steel Manufacturing Process Iron. Making iron is the first step in the production of steel. Iron is usually made from iron ore, coal and limestone - although some plants around the world have developed alternative methods of iron manufacture. These newer methods require slightly different raw materials but iron ore, coal and limestone remain.

The described invention relates to the processing of iron ore, particularly taconite ore. In particular, the invention relates to the separation of the iron containing component from the silicious and other gangue components such as phosphorus compounds in low grade iron ore. Typically, the separation is accomplished by a flotation process to remove the gangue to recover the iron component.

## Process for scavenging iron from tailings produced by flotation 
We claim: 1. A process for recovery of iron from iron ore consisting essentially of subjecting the ore to cationic gangue flotation to produce a flotation concentrate as underflow and flotation tailings as overflow, and subsequently scavenging iron from said tailings by means of a wet high-intensity magnetic separator, whereby a magnetic concentrate of increased iron content and a magnetic
