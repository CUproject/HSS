## Why is coal a primary energy source? - Origin of coal
Coal is a major source of energy in the production of electrical power using steam generation. In addition, gasification and liquefaction of coal produce gaseous and liquid fuels that can be easily transported (e.g., by pipeline) and conveniently stored in tanks.  One of the most important sources of energy is the sun. The energy of the sun

## World's Most Important Source of Renewable Energy
Wind energy poses to be the most important source of energy (Craddock, 2008). Generally, wind is considered to be air in motion. The air motion is caused by natural elements such as the rotary motion of the earth and the irregular heating of the earth by the sun. Since time in memorial people have utilized wind energy for different activities
