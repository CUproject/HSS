The tailings from the re-processing plant will be re-deposited in a new area far from urbanization, allowing for the rehabilitation of the real estate currently occupied by these historic tailings. The first step in the process involves a mild-regrind and mild acid leach of the tailings (pH 2.5 to 3.0) to dissolve up to 40% of the uranium.
