## Iron ore (fines) - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo transport 
Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite

Dec 20, 2021Iron Concentrate is created by purifying Crushed Iron Ore. This can be done in one of two ways: either dry or wet purification, each of which can be performed using one of two crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time. The process to make Iron Concentrate also gives a by-product of either Tailings or Wet Tailings, each of which are pollutants.

Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
