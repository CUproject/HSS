## Ball Mills - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In all ore dressing and milling Operations, including flotation, cyanidation, gravity concentration, and amalgamation, the Working Principle is to crush and grind, often with rod mill or ball mill, the ore in order to liberate the minerals. In the chemical and process industries, grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.

## ball mill working principle | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
Ball Mill Working Principle. Grinding is usually performed wet, although in certain applications dry grinding is used. When the mill is rotated, the mixture of medium, ore, and water, known as the mill charge, is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.
