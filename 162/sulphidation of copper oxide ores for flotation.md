Oxide-sulfide copper ore was sampled from the ore body Cerovo C1 (south deposit) and used in this study. The chemical composition of the ore sample is pre-sented in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be seen that the high copper concentration is in the sample, as well as the high copper oxide content, while the sulfide copper concentration is lower.

Jul 27, 2021Froth flotation is a method of separating ores using the difference in physical and chemical properties of mineral surfaces. It is currently the main method for the flotation of copper oxide. Relatively speaking, froth flotation can be used to separate malachite and azurite. However, chrysocolla and copper phosphate are difficult to float.

Kansanshi copper mine is situated in the north western province of Zambia. As a result of the mineral variations, the processing plant treats three distinct ore types, viz. oxide, sulphide and mixed.

## copper oxide recovery flotation,raymond laboratory mill
The oxide ore has a much higher grade than the mixed and sulphide ores but contributes less to the resource (Broughton et al, 2002) The preferred method for the flotation of oxide and mixed copper ores is sulphidisation The reagents are typically sodium sulphide (Na 2 S) and sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) Slug sulphidisation, which uses a single
