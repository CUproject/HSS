## Bringing HIsmelt back
Put magnetite into the mix and things get better still. One advantage of magnetite is there is less oxygen to remove. Production from the plant increases to 700,000tpa and the coal unit consumption drops. Pre-tax profit grows to $66 million and return on capital increases to 15%.
