## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

## Jaw Crusher Upstream Or Downstream Processing Stone Clay
the jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a v-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. this is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other. compression is created by forcing the rock against the stationary plate in the crushing chamber as shown in fig. 13.9
