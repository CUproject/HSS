## Brittle strength of basaltic rock masses with applications to Venus 
Rock mass strength is defined by three parameters including unconfined compressive strength of intact basalt and two others related to the degree of fracturing of the material. Experimental results for elevated temperature extend the applicability of these parameters to the near-surface environment of Venus.
