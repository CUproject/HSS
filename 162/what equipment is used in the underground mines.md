## Equipment selection - QueensMineDesignWiki
The equipment selection process for an underground mine design plan has an extremely wide scope as there are a myriad of parameters to consider when incorporating mobile and stationary equipment in hard or soft rock mining applications. This article primarily focuses on the initial selection of mobile equipment in hard rock mining operations.

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## What Is Underground Mining? - Groff Engineering & Consulting PLLC
Underground mining is a distinct segment of the mining sector. Underground mining is generally used to extract minerals that are too far underground for surface mining to be economical. There are many different underground mining methods that can be implemented, depending on the mineral being mined and the nature of the deposit.

## A Basic Introduction to Underground Mining
Aug 26, 2021August 26, 2021. Underground mining usually involves the digging of subversive tunnels and rooms below ground surface. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining and can be dangerous. This kind of mining is only used in areas where quality ore, such as gold, are concentrated in thin veins and other remarkably rich deposits.
