## Mineralogical characterisation of chromite in the UG2 Reef from 
During the beneficiation of chromite hosted PGE's by froth flotation, chromite represents the principal gangue mineral. This is particularly true for the UG2 main seam. An excess of more than 3% in mass of chromite in the PGM concentrate is known to result in significant problems in the downstream processing and extraction of PGEs.

## Ferrochrome and Chromite Ore Industry Developments
Chromite is a mineral oxide to which the spinel group refers. It is one of the essential minerals for use in metallic chromium processing. Chromite is also found in stainless steels and as an alloying component in weapon steelsChromite is a commonly occurring iron oxide in olivine, magnetite, serpentine, and corundum.

Tailing streams of an existing chromite plant were characterized and then beneficiated in different methods. Characterization studies have been indicated that chromite grains finely disseminated on the coarse gangue particles in all size fractions (+100 μm). Increase in fineness did not show a significant effect on disseminated chromite grains during coarse tailing beneficiation studies.

from the previous chromite mining operations. The flotation technique was attempted for enriching the Chickay chromite ore. The assay of the feed to the flotation cell was 20.3% Cr 2 O 3. Under optimum conditions, the chromite concentrate assayed 28.7% Cr 2 O 3 at a recovery of 94.5%. Of course, the assay of the obtained concentrate is not
