In this paper, a sample from Tange-zagh iron mine was characterized by gravity and magnetic separation methods. The mineralogical studies showed that hematite and goethite are the main iron-bearing minerals with insignificant amounts of FeO. The results indicated that spiral separation yields higher separation efficiency than others. The combination of spiral and multi gravity methods showed
