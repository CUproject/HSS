The stone should be as small as possible, but not so small that the bed compacts and seals itself. Jacobs reported that a limestone bed five feet deep and a flow rate of 0.5 to 1 gpm/sq. ft. successfully treated a 50,000 mg/l acidity solution. For more dilute solutions, higher flow rates and shallower beds can be used.

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.
