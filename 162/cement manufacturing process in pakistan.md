##  Pakistan CEMENT SECTOR.pk
The production of cement releases greenhouse gas emissions both directly and indirectly: • The direct emissions of cement occur through a chemical process called calcination, which occurs when limestone (made of calcium carbonate,) is heated. This process accounts for ~50% of all emissions from cement production.
