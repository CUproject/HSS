The coarse aggregate grading limits are given in IS 383 - 1970 - table 2, Clause 4.1 and 4.2 for single size aggregate as well as graded aggregate. The grading of coarse aggregate is important to get cohesive & dense concrete. The voids left by larger coarse aggregate particles are filled by smaller coarse aggregate particles and so on.

The particle sizes of the two types of coarse aggregates ranged between 4 mm and 16 mm,  Due to the porous mortar attached to the surface of the old aggregate and the mortar block with relatively weak strength, the water absorption and crushing index of the CRCAs are obviously higher than those of the NCAs.

## Strength of Coarse Aggregates.np
Strength of Coarse Aggregates. Strength of coarse aggregates is difficult to measure. While we talk about the strength of coarse aggregates it refers to the crushing strength of the aggregate itself. However, the required information on strength of coarse aggregates can be obtained from indirect tests: crushing strength of prepared rock samples

## Numerical simulation of influence of coarse aggregate crushing on 
Aug 1, 2022The compressive strength shows a downward trend as the amount of crushable coarse aggregates increases. However, a small amount of coarse aggregate crushing can increase the compressive strength of normal concrete. This is the effect of filling the pores inside the concrete. Coarse aggregate crushing increases the volume of ITZ.

## Coarse Aggregates in High Strength Concrete
Jan 28, 2022When creating high-strength concrete, coarse aggregates with more than about 20% of the particles with length to circumscribed thickness ratios greater than three to one, as defined by ASTM D 4791, should be avoided. Organic debris, clay lumps, and soft particles should not be present in aggregate particles because they will disintegrate or
