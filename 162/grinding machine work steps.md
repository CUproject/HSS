Sep 28, 2021Grinding uses extremely fine micronized abrasives, and the machine tool, grinding tool, and workpiece are in an elastic floating working state. Under the action of low speed and low pressure, the convex points of the processed surface are successively ground, and the processing accuracy can reach 0. 1μm～0.01μm.
