Stringer Requirement We will also be using wooden H-beams for stringers. This will run parallel to the shorter side of the building; Number of H-beam required per line = 12.53/3.9 = 3.21 We can therefore say, provide 3 No of 3.9m H-beam and 1 No of 2.9m H-beam per line. Spacing = 1000mm. Therefore number of lines required = 16.12/1. + 1 = 17 lines

Don't forget to replace the panel before pouring:-) Keep the formwork neat and with tight joints. Gaps as small as 3mm will let out the fines and cement juice, leaving ugly and weak patches in the concrete finish. When formwork under the pressure of wet concrete moves, it is most times impossible to push it back.

Formwork is an ancillary construction, used as a mould for a structure. Into this mould, fresh concrete is placed only to harden subsequently. The construction of formwork takes time and involves expenditure up to 20 to 25% of the cost of the structure or even more. The operation of removing the formwork is known as stripping.
