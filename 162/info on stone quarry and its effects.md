## Quarries - A Solution or a Dust Problem? - Soil Solutions
Quarries. Stone quarrying is a process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into desired sizes. This screened aggregate is then used for the construction of roads, rail lines, bridges, hospitals, schools, airports, factories, and homes, all of which has crucial impact on economic development of any country.
