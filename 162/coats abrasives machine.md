## Understanding Abrasives and Sanding Terminology - Woodworker Express
Closed-Coat. Abrasive grains cover 95-100% of the surface of the backing. Closed-Coat produces a more uniform scratch pattern but clogs more quickly than Open-Coat. It's a good good choice when sanding finishes and for sanding hardwoods such as Oak or Maple. It can provide more aggressive sanding and remove material quicker than Open-Coat.

Jun 2, 2021The term open coat usually indicates an approximate 50% reduction in the abrasive grain. As a result semi-open and open coat abrasives generally cut less aggressively and will finish coarser per grit than closed coat products. This is because semi-open and open coat abrasive products have a reduction in the grain situated on the abrasive

## What Does Open Coat and Closed Coat Mean?
As the name implies, closed coat abrasive products have very little space between the abrasive grains. Close to 95% of the backing material is covered with grains. The benefit is the product will always have the maximum amount of abrasive in contact with the substrate at all time. This equates to speed and efficiency.

## What is the Difference Between Open and Closed Coat Abrasives?
Closed coat abrasives have 90 to 95% of their surface covered by abrasive material and are more suitable for hand-sanding or working with harder wood and metal surfaces. Due to the higher grit-to-surface ratio, closed coat cuts more aggressively and provides a smoother finish due to fewer gaps between the grains.

## Technical Information - Coated Abrasives Basics
There are two types of abrasive coatings used in the manufacturing of coated abrasives: open coat and closed coat. Open Coat With an open coat, 50% to 75% of the coated abrasive surface is covered by abrasive grain. There are evenly spaced voids between the particles of grain, helping reduce the effect of loading caused by wood dust or metal

Open-Coat sandpaper is good for sanding resinous softwoods such as white and yellow pine, and soft materials such as primer and topcoat paints. Closed-Coat - Abrasive grains cover 95-100% of the surface of the backing. Closed-Coat produces a more uniform scratch pattern but clogs more quickly than Open-Coat.

## Color holds the key to abrasive pads | Wood
Hold your hand flat on the pad, or back it with a wood block, and exert even pressure throughout each stroke. When it comes to rubbing out the final coat, experiment to find out what you like best. Pads work well for a glossy finish, but 0000 steel wool might be your best choice for a satin finish because of its more uniform scratch pattern.
