## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
The following process description is based upon a ball mill used in the hard rock mining industry for liberating minerals from ore, but the operating principle for ball mills used in other industries is the same. Crushed ore is fed to the ball mill through the inlet; a scoop (small screw conveyor) ensures the feed is constant.

5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium
