## What Determines the Strength of a Magnet | US Magnetix
Neodymium iron boron (NdFeb) makes the most powerful magnets. Neodymium magnets are so powerful, in fact, that a NEO magnet weighing only a few grams can still attract up to 1,000 times its own weight. External Magnetic Field. To turn a substance into a magnet, it must be exposed to the magnetic field of an existing magnet.

Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich

## Steel vs. Titanium - Strength, Properties, and Uses - Thomasnet
3 days agoElemental titanium is a silver-grey non-magnetic metal with a density of 4.51 g/cm 3, making it almost half as dense as steel and landing it in the "light metal" category. Modern titanium comes either as elemental titanium or in various titanium alloys, all made to increase both the strength and corrosion resistance of the base titanium.

## Is Titanium Magnetic? (ANSWERED) - Yes Dirt

These traits far outweigh its disadvantages and make titanium perfect for the medical and aviation manufacturing industries. You might also like: Is Pyrite Magnetic? Is

## What makes a magnet, a magnet? | Physics Forums
What makes a magnet a magnet is that Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel are attracted by it. Anything that attracts those 3 elements, pure or as alloys is considered a magnet. But your question realy is how do magnets work. My best answer is that nobody knows. Beware of complicated explainations which in the end only explain the observable effects.
