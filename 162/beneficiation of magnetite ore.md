## Beneficiation of a low-grade, hematite-magnetite ore in China
In China, most reserves of rich iron ores have now been depleted and sustainable development of low-grade iron ores has become a critical discussion topic in the mining industry today. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of beneficiating a low-grade, hematite-magnetite ore (assaying 18.64% Fe) for subsequent utilization. In this study, process mineralogy and beneficiation
