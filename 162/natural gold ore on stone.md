Quartz. •••. Gold is most often found in quartz rock. When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides. The white color of quartz makes it easy to spot in many environments.

## How to Identify Raw Gold | Sciencing
Perform a simple test of the material in the pan to assess whether it is real gold. Raw gold appears brassy yellow and bright. If you think it is gold, place your hand between it and the sun to create shade over the gold. If it still appears bright in the pan, chances are that it is real gold. Fool's gold does not appear as bright when shaded.

This can be an indicator of gold. Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz - gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides - which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides. Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.

Placer Gold. Placer gold is formed from already existing lode and intrusive gold deposits. Placer gold is caused by the eroding effect of water upon rock. Rain and the flow of rivers against them will erode rock walls releasing the minerals contained within. These minerals including gold will flow downhill entering into rivers and streams.

## Gold Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Gold Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is to make Gold Bars, which can be used to make the Gold tier of equipment, as well as crowns, Thrones, and several other items. The equivalent of Gold Ore is Platinum Ore, which will sometimes replace Gold in a world. Gold Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes.
