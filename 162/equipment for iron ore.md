Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. These rocks are usually found in the form of hematite (Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4). About 98% of world iron ore production is used to make iron in the form of steel. Nearly all of Earth's major iron ore deposits are in rocks that formed over 1.8 billion years ago.

In the top half of the furnace, gas from burning coke removes a great deal of oxygen from the iron ore. About halfway down, limestone begins to react with impurities in the ore and the coke to form a slag. As the iron is formed, it is periodically extracted by tapping a hole at the bottom of the furnace to allow the molten metal to flow out.
