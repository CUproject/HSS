## Artificial lift - PetroWiki
Artificial lift is a method used to lower the producing bottomhole pressure (BHP) on the formation to obtain a higher production rate from the well.  Sand- or solids-laden production, which can rule out the use of plunger lift, can also cause wear with sucker-rod pumps, reciprocating hydraulic pumps, and jet pumps. Gas lift and PCPs produce
