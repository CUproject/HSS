## Data mining
Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a data mart or data

## Apriori algorithm
Apriori algorithm. Apriori [1] is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.

## Data mining Algorithm Research Papers
ABSTRACT Most statistical and data-mining algorithms assume that data come from a stationary distribution. However, in many real-world classification tasks, data arrive over time and the target concept to be learned from the data stream may change accordingly. Many algorithms have been proposed for learning drifting concepts.
