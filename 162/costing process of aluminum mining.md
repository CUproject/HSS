## Aluminum Production Costs: A Comparative Case Study of Production Strategy
Slumping world aluminum prices have energized some aluminum producers to institute strategies to reduce product costs. This multiple comparative case study explored the strategies used by 4 aluminum producers in Western Europe: 2 companies that have successfully reduced production costs and 2 companies that have not.

The casting process is to pour liquid metal that meets the casting requirements into a mold through a transfer tool, and obtain an ingot of a certain shape and size after cooling. It is required that the cast ingot has uniform chemical composition and structure, good internal and external quality, and size in line with technical standards.

For every ounce of gold produced in 2020, gold miners pocketed $828 on average, significantly higher than the previous high of $666/oz set in 2011. With inflation rates hitting decade-highs in several countries, gold mining could be a sector to watch, especially given gold's status as a traditional inflation hedge.
