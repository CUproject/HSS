## DIY Tool and Cutter Grinder Idea Notebook
At this scale, cutter grinding involves relatively small workpieces, so a giant machine is not called for. Perhaps even a small hobby CNC machine would be able to do this kind of work with a high degree of success. I've become intrigued with the idea of building a small CNC Tool and Cutter Grinder based on a Sieg X2 mill.
