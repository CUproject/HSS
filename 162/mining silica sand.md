## Silica Sand - Gravelshop
About Silica Sand. Silica Sand--also known as quartz sand, industrial sand, white sand--is formed from quartz that has been broken down through wind and sea erosion. Commercial silica sand is mainly used in construction materials like mortar, flooring, cement/asphalt, shingles, and sealant, as it is resistant to corrosion and the elements.

What is Silica Sand? Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed..

Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
