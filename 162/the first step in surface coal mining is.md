## Effects of surface coal mining and land reclamation on soil properties 
1. Introduction. Highly mechanized mining processes are widely used in surface mining because they generally provide an efficient approach for achieving high production (Shrestha and Lal, 2011).However, high production is also associated with large volumes of waste production (Ramani, 2012).During surface mining, the excavated materials from depths of 0-200 m are stripped off and they vary

This technique comes under surface mining and is used when the coal is found very near the top of the land. To get to the coal one has to remove the top layer of rock and soil. The exact steps that are carried out in strip mining are detailed below. 1. A bulldozer is used to remove all plants, trees, and vegetation found on the surface. 2.

The initial task is to gain access to the seam from the surface by some means (shafts, drifts, etc - see Access to Seam from surface section for these terms). Once access has been gained into the coal seam, workings are developed by mining a series of roadways (or " headings "). These roadways are tunnels largely, if not totally, within the

## surface coal mining history | The Pop History Dig
Surface mining existed as well, but it wasn't until the big shovels came on in the 1940s and 1950s that strip mining began to take a larger portion of the state's annual coal production. Generally it is economic to strip mine when there is a 20:1 ratio of overburden-to-coal seam, meaning, for example that a three-foot coal seam can be
