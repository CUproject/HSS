## Henry Cort
Henry Cort (c. 1740 - 23 May 1800) was an English ironware producer although formerly a Navy pay agent. During the Industrial Revolution in England, Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1784, he patented an improved version of the puddling process for refining cast iron although its commercial viability was only

Iron beneficiation has been evident since as early as 800 BC in China with the use of bloomery. A bloomery is the original form of smelting and allowed people to make fires hot enough to melt oxides into a liquid that separates from the iron.  Where the DMS occurs in the process can be important, the grinders or mills will process much less

## beneficiation process for iron ore
Beneficiation is the process where ore is reduced in size and gange separated from the ore. Since all iron ore deposits have unique mineralogy, the beneficiation process is specific to each deposit. Separation of certain minerals can be efficiently achieved by taking advantage
