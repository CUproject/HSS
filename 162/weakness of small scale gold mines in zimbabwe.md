## Artisanal and Small-scale Mining in Africa: Opportunities and  - SAIIA
Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is a thorny issue for both governments and large scale mining (LSM) companies.  In Zimbabwe, for example, artisanal diamond miners in the Marange area increased from a handful in 2004 to an estimated 35 000 in 2007.  In Ghana ASM contributed 9% of total gold production in 2000, but by 2010 this had

## The burden of chronic mercury intoxication in artisanal small-scale 
Artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a poverty-driven activity practiced in over 70 countries worldwide. Zimbabwe is amongst the top ten countries using large quantities of mercury to extract gold from ore. This analysis was performed to check data availability and derive a preliminary estimate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to mercury use in ASGM in Zimbabwe.

Trans-national companies operate many of the major mines while nationals largely run small mines. Small-scale artisanal gold mining has attracted many people, especially during times of economic hardship. The International Labour Organization (1999) estimated that between 50,000 and 350,000 persons are involved in small-scale mining in Zimbabwe.

Mar 15, 2022Abstract. Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

Introduction. In Zimbabwe, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) 1 has long been an important economic sector and a contentious arena for policymaking. The sector involves rudimentary forms of mineral extraction, and extensive research has discussed its environmental risks (Zwane et al., 2006).Research has also shown that it provides economic revenues that rural communities depend on for
