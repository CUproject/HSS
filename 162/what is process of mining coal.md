## Coal Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Description. Coal is one of the world's major sources of energy. Coal is used to produce nearly one-third of all the electrical energy that is generated and used in the United States. Coal is a very complex and diverse energy resource that can vary greatly, even within the same deposit. In general, there are four basic varieties of coal

## What is the process of making coal? - Origin of coal
Coal is an example of Sedimentary rocks. Coal is a biochemical sedimentary rock because coal is formed from organic matter or sediment that comes from biological processes. Coal is typically found near swampy areas, or areas where sediment has little contact with oxygen.

The actual mining occurs at this step. It is done in a narrow strip in an elongated form. First, the primary strip is mined for coal. After it is extracted thoroughly, the second strip is created by removing filth, rock, and waste from the top. This debris is dumped on top of the first and used strip. The process repeated till the last strip is

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Feb 15, 2022Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
