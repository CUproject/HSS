## Basic PLC Ladder Programming Example 13 - PLC Tutorial Point
PLC Ladder Programming Description: Once the photoelectric sensor detects a product, X0 will go from OFF to ON once, and C0 will count for one time. When the present value in C0 reaches 10, the Normally Open contact C0 will be closed. Y0 = ON, and the. robotic arm will begin to pack.

##  Automatic Packaging Line Control System using PLC - IJSER
4.3. Ladder Logic Diagrams of Packaging Line Control System . Programmable logic controller Mitsubishi FX2N-10MR was used to control and automate the system by ladder logic diagram software. X0 uses as main switch to start up and X1 uses as main switch toturn off the packaging system. Fig-ure.10 shows ladder diagram detecting boxes and counting of
