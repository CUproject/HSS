Electroscope. Using an electroscope, you can determine whether an object is charged or the polarity of the charge. When the (+) charged body is close to the metal plate, the metal foil's free electrons are attracted to the metal plate, and a positive charge is induced in the metal foil. The electric force unfolds metal foil.

Charge can be transferred to the electroscope by 'wiping' a charged rod or balloon on the top plate. The electroscope is actually measuring the potential difference between the earth and the plate.

Although never very accurate, the instruments could sometimes detect as little as 10-14 coulomb and were used to measure

## Electroscope: Definition, Types, Working, Functions - Collegedunia
Jun 27, 2022Gold-leaf Electroscope. It's made up of a vertical conductive rod with a metal ball on top and two thin gold leaf strips joined at the bottom. This electroscope, invented by Abraham Bennet in 1787, is more sensitive than a pith-ball electroscope. The gold leaf is maintained in a glass bottle to protect it from air draughts.

## Gold Leaf Electroscope: Definition, Construction, Application.
Aug 15, 2022A gold-leaf electroscope is a form of electroscope that comprises two gold leaves and is used to detect the electric charges of a body and classify its polarity. In 1787, Abraham Bennet devised the gold-leaf electroscope. It is considered to be more accurate than the Pith-ball electroscope. The gold leaf is maintained in a glass container to

The NBS Standard Gold Leaf Electroscope. The ionization chamber consists of a 10 cm-cube free-air volume, with walls made of 1 cm thick lead sheet with ½ cm thick aluminum lining. A gold leaf is suspended near the center of the chamber and a quartz fiber, 10 µm in diameter, at the free end of the leaf provides a fine scale for optical
