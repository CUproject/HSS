The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.

Phosphorus is common within geological materials. The average continental crust contains 0.27% P 2 O 5. 1 Phosphorus is the primary resources to produce fertilizer and phosphorous-based products. 2 Phosphorus is neither substitutable nor recyclable, therefore, the total demand must be provided through the mining, beneficiation and chemical processing of phosphate ores.
