## All About Rhyolite - Uses, Properties, Color, and Worth
Rhyolite is an extrusive igneous rock and is high in silica content. This fine grained igneous rock will typically contain the minerals quartz, plagioclase, and sanidine with lesser amounts of biotite and hornblende. Rhyolite is formed closer to the surface of the earth. Both rhyolite and granite can be quite similar in appearance, however

## Rhyolite Rock Facts: Geology and Uses - ThoughtCo
Rhyolite is a silica-rich igneous rock found throughout the world. The rock received its name from German geologist Ferdinand von Richthofen (better known as the Red Baron, a World War I flying ace).The word rhyolite comes from the Greek word rhýax (a stream of lava) with the suffix "-ite" given to rocks. Rhyolite is similar in composition and appearance to granite, but it forms through a
