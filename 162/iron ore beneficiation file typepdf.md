## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

##  Chapter-8 Beneficiation of Iron Ores
C is one for very thin disc, and zero for very long rod. For general ore particles it varies from 0.15 to 0.25 Any change in field intensity causes the change in permeability and hence flux density. If field intensity is increased the flux density also increases. When a particle placed in to a homogeneous magnetic field, the particle is exposed
