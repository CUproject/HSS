To help the grinding process, water and steel balls are added to the process which then form the charge in the mill. Ball mill charge contains a significant amount of steel balls and can become extremely heavy. For example, a large 24 foot (7.3 m) diameter ball mill charge typically weighs around 2 million lbs (907 tons).

Charge Motion inside a SAG Mill. For proper design of SAG mills and other types of grinding mills, the operating conditions have to be defined. Predicting the composition of the SAG mill charge is a difficult task since a number of significant phenomena associated with the charge motion must be taken into consideration.

Usually the charge volume of SAG mills occupy between 30-40% of its internal volume at which the grinding rate is maximized. When the charge volume is more, then the throughput suffers. The fill level is monitored by mill weight measurement as most modem mills are invariably mounted on load-cells.
