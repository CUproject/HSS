## Crushing of coal and calculation of size reduction efficiency.
The Process plant has been designed for coal size - 13 mm ( 80 % passing). The 610 mm dia cyclones are inefficient at sizes less than 3 mm. Hence a study has been made from the plant data to arrive at the crushing efficiency of crushers.  The ore particles to be crushed and nipped are pulled inward through the rolls by friction. The nipped
