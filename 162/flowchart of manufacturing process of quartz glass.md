## Flow Chart of Nylon 6 Manufacturing Process - Textile Flowchart
Flow Chart of Nylon-6 Manufacturing Process. Nylon 6 is produced by ring-opening chain-growth polymerization. In presence of water vapor and an acid catalyst at the melt. After removal of water and acid, the nylon 6 is melt-spun at 250°-260°C into fibers. Nylon 6,6 is prepared by step-growth polymerization of hexamethylene diamine and
