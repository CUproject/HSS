Like mining, beneficiation (processing, crushing, separating, smelting, refining, etc.) for chromite depends on the characteristics of the ore deposit and on the mining methods used. For example, an operation extracting only high-grade ore may require only hand sorting and screening.

Chromite is the only ore for chromium, a hard corrosion resistant metal that can be polished, has a high melting point and is used primarily as a coating/finish for stainless steel. Its yellow color is also used in pigments. Chromite is part of the spinel group of minerals. Chromite is associated with the minerals olivine, magnetite, serpentine

## Chromite mining methods
Oct 16, 2015· Chromite mining has not been systematic but random and totally disorganised. It is mined by both open pit and underground methods. In Muslimbagh, Ras Koh Range and Wad areas, chromite is mostly mined by open pit method. However, due to podiform nature of the chromite, underground mining is also done.
