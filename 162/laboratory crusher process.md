## Simulating a laboratory-scale cone crusher in DEM using polyhedral 
Cutaway view of the laboratory-scale cone crusher adopted in the simulations. Experiments consisted of manual feeding samples containing from 10 to 15 kg of material in the size range of 22.4-16.0 mm to the crusher and collecting timed samples of the product. Choke-fed conditions were maintained during the tests.
