There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Steel manufacturing process pptn-musicfestival
Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore, coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace. The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4-4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle. So we need to move to further process the steel to achieve the desired.
