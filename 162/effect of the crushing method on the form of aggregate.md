Effect of Size. The grading or size distribution of aggregate has a considerable effect on the properties of concrete as it determines the paste requirement for workability of concrete. The paste also affects the cost of the mix as cement is the most expensive component in the mix. Hence, it is required that optimum size of aggregates is used
