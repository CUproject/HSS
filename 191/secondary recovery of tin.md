7.3 Why enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Secondary oil recovery methods increase volumes of recovered oil. Nevertheless, despite the increase in oil recovery rate as a result of the use of secondary oil recovery methods, in particular the most effective oil flooding, a significant amount of residual oil remains in the reservoir.

## USA - Process for the recovery of tin - Google Patents
A process is described for recovering tin from oxide or oxide/sulphide low-grade starting materials and concentrates containing little or relatively low concentrations of tin, in which such low-grade starting materials are mixed with KOH and decomposed at high temperatures. The decomposed substance is then leached with water, and metallic tin is separated out electrolytically in one or more
