Assume the test specimen is of 28 days old and max compression load at which the specimen starts breaking is 165KN. As per above fig, Surface are is 50Sq.cm = 5000mm 2. 1 KN = 1000N = 165 x 1000 = 165000. As per formula, Compressive strength of cement = 165000/5000 = 33N/mm2. Hence, the Grade of cement is 33 Grade.

Feb 19, 2022The compressive strength of concrete is defined as the resistance to failure under the decided force. It is the maximum load applied at any cross-sectional area. You can calculate the compressive strength of concrete by the formula, F = P / A. Where, F is the compressive strength. P is the maximum load applied in Newton.

Mar 2, 2021From the histogram of compressive strength for cement mortar up to 180 days of curing (Fig. 2c), 32% of the data out of the overall 450 compressive strength varied from 20 to 40 MPa as shown in Fig. 3. More than 4% of the compressive strength of the cement mortar modified with SF data was 25 MPa out of maximum compressive strength reported of

## to determine compressive strength of cement mortar
To determine the compressive strength of standard cement sand mortar cubes, the following apparatus and methods of the test are undertaken :- Apparatus: 7.06cm cubes moulds (50cm2 face area), apparatus for measuring and blending mortar, vibrator, compression testing machine etc.
