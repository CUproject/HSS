## Ocean Currents: Modeling the 'Global Conveyor Belt' in Your Kitchen
A global "conveyor belt" is set in motion when deep water forms in the North Atlantic, sinks, moves south, circulates around Antarctica, and then moves northward to the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic basins. A simplified version of the global conveyor belt is shown in Figure 1, below. The global conveyor belt moves water slowly, 10 centimeters

## How to make a Conveyor Belt | Pink Stripey Socks
So this was the perfect little toy to whip up. Here's how I made this conveyor belt: 1. First, I washed and dried a milk carton. 2. Then, I cut off the top pointy bit and two opposite sides of the milk carton. 3. Then, I ripped out two pairs of holes on opposite sides of the carton. I made them big enough to hold my pens.

## Build Mini Conveyor Belt As Slinky Machine - Instructables
Step 1: Build Rollers, Frame and Motor Mount. You need two rollers, one to which the motor is attached and one at the other end of the frame so that the belt can loop around. I made mine from 32mm diameter pvc pipe. My rollers are 8cm wide, for a belt 6.5 cm wide which is the same width of my slinky, 6.5 cms.

## Appropriate motor for building a conveyor belt and a few issues.
For a conveyor belt you should look at "tabletop chain". As the name implies its a wide, linked chain and not a belt but it's usually the practical solution. If you need rubber belt try looking at hay baler belt. It holds .55kg at a 1 cm distance from the center of rotation (the shaft). It holds .055kg at 10 cm.

The belt is fitted with appropriate intensity on the frame. Now we connect a motor to one of the rollers. The motor nor moves the roller which inturn moves the belt. This in turn moves the other rollers in order to move objects over it at desired speed. Thus we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a mini conveyer belt system.
