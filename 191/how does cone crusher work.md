## What is crushers and how do they work in mining industry?
How does cone crusher work for rock crushing? A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed

## How Do Cone Crushers Work? - SJCSKS
Jun 2, 2022A cone crusher is a crushing device wherein the mantle rotates eccentrically. This eccentric motion causes the gap between the mantle and concave to move from the narrow setting to the widest setting. This movement increases the crushing force. The mantle is a fixed ring inside the upper casing of the crusher.
