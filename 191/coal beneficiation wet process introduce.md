Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.

## Process Of Coal Beneficiation
The wet beneficiation process for coal cleaning is currently the predominant method of purification of coal in the world. However dry beneficiation of coal has obvious advantages over wet processes. The dry processes for coal are based on the physical properties of coal and its associated mineral matters. Different types of equipment for dry .
