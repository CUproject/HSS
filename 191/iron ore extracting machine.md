The Iron is extracted from the ore that contains the most amount of iron. The iron is extracted from its oxide ore called Hematite. Many things are produced in the extracting or iron from iron ore in a blast furnace. The iron ore is reacted with carbon and oxygen in the furnace to produce carbon dioxide and iron metal.
