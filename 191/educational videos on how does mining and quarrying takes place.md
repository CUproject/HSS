The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector is part of the natural resources and mining supersector. The Mining sector comprises establishments that extract naturally occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas. The term mining is used in the broad sense

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

Quarrying. At present, there are approximately ninety (90) active mining operations (both public and private), where forty-five (45) of these are sand and gravel quarries. In Tobago the primary material quarried is andesite. For the year 2013, local aggregate production was estimated at just above six million cubic yards.
