## Antimony - Earth Resources
Jun 2, 2021Stibnite from Comadai near Bacchus Marsh, Victoria (Scale: 5 cm) When used as an alloying element, antimony greatly increases the hardness and mechanical strength of lead. The main use of antimony is to harden lead in storage batteries, and it is increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry. Historically and economically, antimony is

## Antimony - Minerals Education Coalition
Relation to Mining. Antimony rarely occurs in its native metallic form in nature. It easily combines with other elements, usually including sulfur, to form over 100 different minerals. Of these minerals, only stibnite (Sb2S3) is mined commercially as a source for metallic antimony. Antimony is found in trace amounts in silver, copper and lead
