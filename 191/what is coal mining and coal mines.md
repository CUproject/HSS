Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

Highwall mining is an adaptation of auger mining. Instead of an auger hole, an entry into the coal seam is made by a continuous miner, remotely operated from a cabin at the surface. The cut coal is transported by conveyors behind the miner to the outside. Using a television camera, the operator can see and control the miner's progress.

## History of Mining Coal in Missouri | World History
Missouri began mining coal in the 1840s and was the first commercial coal mining state west of the Mississippi River. Most of the early mines were underground and have since been abandoned. Surface mining didn't start in Missouri until the 1930s. By the '60s, the majority of the coal produced in the state came from surface mines.
