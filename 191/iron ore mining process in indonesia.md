## Mining industry of Nigeria
The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3% of its gross domestic product, due to the influence of its vast oil resources. The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped, leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically, such as salt or iron ore.Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria, which grants titles

Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron ore processing (iron making) industry in Indonesia.
The country has no smelter to process iron ore into midstream steel products like pellet. Indonesia exports its iron ore mainly to China, Japan, India and South Korea and re-imports the material in the form of pellet to produce sponge iron.  In 2011, there were five iron ore mining companies operating in Aceh including PT. Pinang Sejati
