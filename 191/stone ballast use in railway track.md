Abstract. Railway track formations generally consist essentially of a layer of coarse aggregate, or ballast, in which the sleepers are embedded (see Fig. 12.1). The ballast may rest directly on the subgrade or, depending on the bearing capacity, on a layer of blanketing sand. The layer of ballast is intended to provide a free draining base
