## Jaw Crushers - MEKA Crushing & Screening Plants
Jaw crushers reduce large rocks or ore by means of compression. Mechanical pressure is applied using the crusher's two jaw; one is fixed while the other makes an eccentric movement. There are also primary and secondary types of these crushers. Jaw crushers are one of the most commonly preferred crushers due to their ability to crush all kinds

## What are the Materials of the Jaw Crusher Plates and Which is Better 
What are the jaw materials of the jaw crusher? High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance.However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

## impact vs jaw crushers - Crushing and Screening Plant
The biggest difference between jaw crusher and impact crusher is: jaw crusher is always used as the primary crusher while the impact crusher is always used as the secondary crusher.. Jaw crusher has the characteristic of high impact resistance. So it is suitable for the primary crushing. The impact resistance of impact crusher is small, but it is good at shaping the product.

## How to Choose a Rock Crusher - Sepro Aggregates
Jaw Crusher Applications. Jaw crushers generally have a 10:1 reduction ratio, so a standard 30×48 jaw crusher with a 30" opening will have a minimum closed side setting of three inches. While jaw crushers can be used in all industries requiring a crushing application, the most common applications are: Hard rock; Round rock; Sand and gravel

## Estimate Jaw Crusher Capacity - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The capacities are based on the crusher receiving full, continuous feed of clean, dry, friable stone weighing 100 lb/cu ft. These capacity tables show several significant differences between the two common types of primary crushers. A jaw crusher has a wider range of settings—generally, a maximum of two to three times the smallest setting.
