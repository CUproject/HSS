## What is Lightweight Concrete? -Types, Uses and Advantages
Classification of Lightweight Concrete. It is convenient to classify the various types of lightweight concrete by their method of production. These are: By using porous lightweight aggregate of low apparent specific gravity, i.e. lower than 2.6. This type of concrete is known as lightweight aggregate concrete.

Muffle furnace tests were made on samples of clay, claystone, and shale collected in the Chittagong and Dacca areas of East Pakistan to determine their amenability to bloating for the commercial production of light-weight aggregate. Several areas, sampled in some detail, were selected for investigation because of their proximity to market, and accessibility to fuel and electricity.

Mar 13, 2022The production of lightweight aggregate (LWA) from industrial byproducts is one of the methods for safe and massive disposal. The production and use of lightweight aggregate (LWA) in the construction industry is not a new concept. The evidence regarding the utilization of lightweight aggregate can be obtained from ancient civilizations.

Standard Mix. The nominal concrete mix of a fixed proportion of cement, sand and aggregate provide considerable variation in strength resulting in the poor or over-rich mix. Hence minimum compressive strength has been assigned in many proportions and termed as the standard mix. As per IS 456:2000 Standard Concrete grades are M 25, M 30, M 35, M.
