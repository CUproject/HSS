## Difference Between M Sand Vs River Sand | What is M-Sand  - CivilJungle
Difference Between M sand and River sand. Concrete with m sand has very poor permeability as compared to river sand. But when river sand is used in concrete the permeability of concrete is less poor as compared to river sand. It has more water absorption 2 to 4 %. Whereas water absorption of river sand is less 1.5 to 3%.

Sep 20, 2021Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.
