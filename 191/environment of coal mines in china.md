Sep 5, 2022Climate Change. Coal mining is responsible for a host of environmental impacts, including air pollution, water pollution, land degradation, and acid rain. The burning of coal is also responsible for releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to climate change.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
After undergoing a cleansing process, coal is typically burned in order to produce electricity. The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways.
