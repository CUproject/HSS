## Origin of late dolomite cement by CO2-saturated deep basin brines 
Studies of fluid inclusions in regionally extensive late dolomite cement (LDC) throughout the Ozark region show that CO2 effervescence was widespread during dolomite precipitation. LDC with trace amounts of sulfides can be deposited by effervescences of a CO2-saturated basin brine as it migrates to shallower levels and lower conifning pressures.

4. Tamp down the soil where the rocks will go. This will impede future settling and stop you from having to add more landscaping rock later. 5. Before pouring your landscaping rock, lay landscape fiber or newspaper to stop weed growth. 6. After you pour the rock, use a rake to even it out. Kneel down to look for peaks and valleys.
