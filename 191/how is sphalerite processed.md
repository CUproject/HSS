## Sphalerite: Mineral information, data and localities.
Sphalerite, also known as blende or zinc blende, is the major ore of zinc. When pure (with little or no iron) it forms clear to white crystals (known as Cleiophane ). Yellow to orange sphalerite is often called "golden sphalerite." Red shades of sphalerite are known as Ruby Blende or Ruby Jack. As iron content increases, sphalerite forms dark

## Why is the sphalerite important?sewing
What is the importance of sphalerite ore rock? Economic importance: Sphalerite is the most important zinc ore. Approximately 95% of all primary zinc is extracted from sphalerite ores. However, due to the variable trace element content, sphalerite is an important source of many other elements such as cadmium, gallium, germanium and indium.

Jun 8, 2022Sphalerite Ore Feed The Beast Wiki FANDOM powered by Wikia - Know More. Sphalerite Ore is an addition from GregTech It spawns in The Nether When mined, it drops Sphalerite Dust, with a little chance to get Zinc Dust and a lesser chance to get a Yellow Garnet, which can be processed in an Industrial Electrolyzer to receive one Zinc Dust and one Sulfur Dust Mining.
