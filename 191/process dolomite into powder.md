Dolomite, like calcite, cleaves into six-sided polyhedrons with diamond-shaped faces. Relations between lamellar twinning and cleavage planes of dolomite, however, differ from those of calcite (see figure), and this difference may be used to distinguish the two minerals in coarse-grained rocks such as marbles.
