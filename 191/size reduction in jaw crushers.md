## Ratio Reduction Jaw Crusher-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
Mar 16, 2021 Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. These production improvements come from a number of engineering changes, but a large part is due to better crushing chamber design.

Almost all quarry and mining operations today make use of crushers to reduce the size of larger materials; loose (smaller) sized materials do not typically require a crushing stage.  If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension. Sizes may be given in

The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted. Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1.

Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor.  Size reduction in an impact crusher relies on energy being conveyed into the rock from the rotor, and it begins with your feed.

##  Construction Working and Maintenance of Crushers for Crushing Bulk 
For primary crushing with a reduction ratio of 6 to 1. When a relatively coarse product is desired, top size usually larger than 38 mm (1 1/2") Closed Circuit Crushing System To control top size from a single crusher operating in an open circuit, material must remain in the crushing chamber until the material is reduced to top size.
