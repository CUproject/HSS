According to him, prices of imported iron ore fines are still rather expensive, and that's one of the reasons why steel mills have slashed their sintered ore consumption. Over the past couple of weeks, the cost efficiency of using lump has declined compared with using pellets, now that coke prices have surged to a rather high level.

World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron. The only source of primary iron is iron ore, but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel, it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace.
