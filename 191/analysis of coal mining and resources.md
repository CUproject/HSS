## Analysis on the Characteristics of Water Pollution Caused by  - Hindawi
May 19, 2021Coal is the primary source of energy in China's energy structure system. With the large-scale mining of mineral resources, a large amount of mine water will be produced in the process of development, construction, and production, which will pollute and damage the ecological environment of mine water. At present, China vigorously advocates coal revolution, implements low-carbon economy, and

## Coal Mining and Processing - The National Academies Press
Although the United States has the vast coal resource described in the previous chapter, perhaps as much as 4 trillion tons, the key issue for policy makers is the amount of coal that is economically recoverable.This is not a fixed quantity, but depends on the geological resource, the market price, and the cost of mining. The particular characteristics of the coal mining industry create unique

## Coal Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The environmental aspects of mining have received little analysis. U.S. coals vary in moisture content (2 to 40%), sulfur content (0.2 to 8%) and ash content (5 to 40%). The energy content varies from lignite to sub-bituminous to bituminous coal. The ORNL-RFF study looks at two levels of sulfur content (0.7% and 2.1%).
