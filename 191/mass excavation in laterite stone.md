## What is laterite stone? - ameasy
Score: 4.1/5 (31 votes) . Laterite is both a soil and a rock type rich in iron and aluminium and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content.  Historically, laterite was cut into brick-like shapes and used in monument-building.

## Rate Analysis of Excavation in Earthwork -Calculate Excavation Cost
The cost of hydraulic excavator for 10m 3 excavation = 0.04125x5000 = Rs.206.25 Likewise, based on the capacity of other equipment, labors etc., their cost is calculated. Contractors profit is also added to the total cost of labors and machineries. Then grand total gives the rate of excavation per 10m 3 of soil excavation.
