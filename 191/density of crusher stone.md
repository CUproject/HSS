2. Particle density. Bulk density is Weight per volume, finer the crushed stone higher the bulk density, as finer crushed stone have less gaps between the aggregates when compared to large sized aggregates. Particle density is the molecular structure of the stone which determines how good the particles inside the stone are packed.

The quality of granite is judged from how far the resulting value of the density of crushed stone is from the density of granite - 2.7 g / cm3 (or 2.7 kg / dm3). Too different from the "granite" value of the absolute density suggests that the crushed stone is not made of granite at all, but, say, basalt or, in general, secondary.

Generally #57 gravel is processed from concrete or Florida limerock. Granite is typically used when the application calls for a decorative stone.

## Bulk density of crushed stone/bsn
The density of crushed stone 20/40 is in the range of kg / m 3. Stones 40/70 are similar to the previous ones - kg / m 3. It is difficult to confuse granite crushed stone with other types: stones are characteristic from dark gray to pinkish, shades are caused by the inclusion of different minerals in the base rock.
