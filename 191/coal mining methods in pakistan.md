## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Feb 15, 2022Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Coal mining trends and future prospects: A case study of Eastern Salt 
Mining of coal is carried out in two forms; either as surface mining or underground mining. The selection of mining methods depends on the coal seam thickness, angle of deposition, terrain and the rock mechanics of the surrounding rocks (Hartman and Mutmansky, 2002; Miller et.al., 1995).

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Mining Methods Now and in the Future - Advancing Mining
Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.
