## Indiana Limestone: A Natural Wonder - Mason Contractors
Since the first organized Indiana limestone quarry opened in 1827, Indiana limestone has been in constant use, making an impact on American architecture. Projects utilizing Indiana limestone, many of which are up to 100 years old, exist in every American city, in many small towns and villages, in Canada, and in every type of atmosphere.

## Natural Indiana Limestone History - Accent Limestone & Carving
The limestone is extracted from large quarries and cut into large blocks. People began quarrying Indiana Limestone in the early 1800s with the first quarry established in 1827. Upon completion of the railroads in the 1850s, Indiana Limestone was able to be transported across the country, and it quickly became America's stone of choice.
