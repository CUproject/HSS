## Are sources for soil pollution?hcharge
What is soil pollution and sources of soil pollution? Soil contamination or soil pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste.
