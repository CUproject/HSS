Adhesive Test: Two bricks are joined together with mortar to be tested as shown in above Fig. The upper brick is suspended from an overhead support. A board is hung from the lower brick. Then weights are added to the board till the bricks separate. The adhesive strength is the load divided by the area of contact.

Compressive Strength of bricks. Generally, bricks have high compressive strength in the range of 5.5 N / mm 2 to 140 N/mm 2. If the crushing strength of the bricks is less than 3.5 N/mm 2 it must not be used. A field test about strength of the bricks is to fall the brick from a height of 1 meter and it must not break in to pieces.

##  BS EN 771-1 BS 3921 British Standard Specification for Clay Bricks
For DPC bricks the mean water absorption should be declared by the manufacturer. The mean should not be greater than the declared water absorption and the test involves placing in boiling water for 5 hours. BS 3921 Size of Voids Solid bricks have no perforations or frogs. Perforated bricks have holes not exceeding 25% of the gross volume of brick.

## Classification Of Bricks - BrainKart
The crushing strength should not be less than 7.0 N/mm 2.  The burnt clay bricks having compressive strength more than 40.0 N/mm 2 are known as heavy duty bricks and are used for heavy duty structures such as bridges, foundations for industrial buildings, multistory buildings, etc. The water absorption of these bricks is limited to 5 per cent.
