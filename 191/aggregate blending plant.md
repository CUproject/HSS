## Aggregate Blending Constraints | Stonemont Solutions
Aggregate sources don't produce all materials at the same tons per hour. Rarely does the demand for products match the plant's output either. Setting up blend percentage constraint's that more closely match a source materials output and demands can help keep plants in balance ensuring that every rock gets sold.

Water-to-Cement Ratio and Aggregate Moisture Corrections. If the coarse aggregate has a moisture content of 1.5% we will instead need to batch about 1946 pounds of coarse aggregate per cubic yard of concrete (1917 lb/yd3  1.015 = 1946 lb/yd3). Similar calculations also apply to fine aggregate moisture adjustments.

The dry mix design involves three important steps, viz. Selection of aggregates, Aggregates gradation, and. Proportion of aggregates, 1. Selection of Aggregates. The desirable qualities of a bituminous paving mixture are dependent to a considerable degree on the nature of the aggregates used. Aggregates are classified as coarse, fine, and filler.
