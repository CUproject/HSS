## Massachusetts Rockhounding Location Guide & Map
Franklin County. Franklin County is the best area of Massachusetts for rockhounding, both for the number of localities and the wide selection of rocks and minerals to be found. The Deerfield area in particular has several sites where you can find specimens of agate nodules, amethyst, and even the occasional geode.

Minerals of the feldspathoid group occur in a large number of basaltic rocks belonging to the alkali group; nepheline, analcime, and leucite are the commonest, but ha√ºynite is occasionally present. If nepheline entirely replaces feldspar, the rock is known as nepheline-basalt; if the replacement is only partial, the term nepheline-basanite is used. . Similarly, there are analcime- and leucite

Basalt. Basalt is a mafic extrusive rock, is the most widespread of all igneous rocks, and comprises more than 90% of all volcanic rocks. Because of its relatively low silica content, basalt lava has a comparatively low viscosity, and forms thin flows that can travel long distances. It is also found as intrusive dikes and sills.

Basalt rocks are mainly composed of pyroxene olivine and plagioclase, these rocks are rich in Magnesium and iron. The most porphyritic minerals in basalt rocks are augite and olivine. Basaltic lavas are pumiceous and spongy. These stocks can be categorized into two parts in terms of petrographic basis. Alkali basalts- that contain olivine.

Kapowsin Quarry is a basalt quarry. Unlike a granite or marble quarry, we don't cut rock into perfectly rectangular blocks. Instead, we break up rock deposits with dynamite. The rock is blown into large pieces, which are sorted by size. Most of the rock is broken down even more and crushed into pieces of many different sizes.

Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities. This is partly due to different rocks of the same type containing different proportions of minerals. Granite, for example, can have a quartz content anywhere between 20% and 60%.

Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro.

Basalt Rocks. Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is very dark in color. It is the most common type of rock in the Earth's crust and it makes up most of the ocean floor. It is made of many dark colored minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt also contains some light colored minerals such as feldspar and quartz, but the amounts are small.

## Basalt | Islands Wiki | Fandom
Basalt is a block obtained by defeating rock mimics and mining basalt rocks. Basalt rocks naturally generate on Buffalkor Island. Mining a basalt rock yields 2 - 4 basalt after each stage and 3 Mining XP (6 with the 4x daily bonus), resulting in a total of 4 - 8 basalt and 9 Mining XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus) per rock. Rock mimics of any kind are guaranteed to drop 4 - 7 basalt upon defeat

## Where Basalt Rocks form
Basalt rock is the most common igneous rocks in the crust. The rocks contain ferromagnesian minerals that are rich in iron and magnesium. The giant shield volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean, the seafloors, cinder cones, and flood basalts are all basalt rocks. Basalt is a dark heavy lava that is very hot and fluid when it erupts.
