Plants and the "good' algae that grow on the pond help remove the nitrates.  All our filter systems are design for specific pond sizes and a filter system that is too small will not effectively filter the pond. The equation for calculating the pond size is m3 x 1000. So if you have a pond of 2m x 3m x 1m deep the calculation would be:
