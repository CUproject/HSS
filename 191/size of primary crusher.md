5.1 Introduction. Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste ( gangue) material.

In any operation that incorporates size reduction, selecting the primary crusher is vital to the overall success. The main parameters to first decide on a general type of crusher are the impact strength, product size and material hardness. The final design for a crusher will be selected primarily based on required capacity, feed and product size.
