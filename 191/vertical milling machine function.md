## Horizontal Milling, Vertical Milling - What is a Milling Machine?
A milling machine is basically used for shaping, routing, boring, and drilling metals and other solid materials. Generally there are two categories of the milling machine which include the vertical type and the horizontal type. In order to optimize the capacity of the milling machine, it is essential to identify the appropriate milling machine type for specific tasks. Today, there are a number
