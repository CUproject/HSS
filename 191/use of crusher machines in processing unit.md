Coal miners use giant machines to remove coal from the ground. They use two methods: surface or underground mining. Modern mining methods allow us to easily reach most of our coal reserves. Due to growth in surface mining and improved mining technology, the amount of coal produced by one miner in one hour has more than tripled since 1978.

## Why Mini Mobile Crushers are the Future of Jobsite Material Processing 
Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines that break down rocks into smaller pieces, gravel, sand, or dust. They are essential machines used in quarries or for preparing rugged landscapes for construction work. Typically, the crusher features a fixed, V-shaped jaw and a mobile swing jaw. The rocks are fed into the machine and pass through the fixed jaw.
