About Silica Sand. Silica Sand--also known as quartz sand, industrial sand, white sand--is formed from quartz that has been broken down through wind and sea erosion. Commercial silica sand is mainly used in construction materials like mortar, flooring, cement/asphalt, shingles, and sealant, as it is resistant to corrosion and the elements.

He notes that silica sand or aluminum oxide beads have also been used, but these materials can change the appearance of decorative concrete. The advantages of the plastic grit are that it is nearly transparent and that it is so light it stays suspended throughout the sealer. This allows new grit to be exposed as the sealer wears.

## Silica vs. Silica: What's the Difference as Far  - Decorative Concrete
Lots of countertop makers use 30 to 40 mesh crystalline silica sand in their GFRC mixes. Crystalline silica flour is silica ground very fine, sometimes as fine as 5 um (microns), much finer than the 45 um (about 325 mesh) typical of portland cement. Stucco guys and even some concrete countertop makers use silica flour in their mixes.

## Polymeric Sand
Unlike basic silica sand, polymeric sand does not depend on the sealer to create a hard surface as the polymeric sand hardens from the top through to the bottom of the fill. It also adheres or bonds to the sides of the concrete or brick pavers. Secondarily, because of this hardening and bonding the polymeric sand provides protection from water
