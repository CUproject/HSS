## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.

## EarthWord-Ferrous | U.S. Geological Survey
The EarthWord: Ferrous. Definition: Sadly this is not the same as a Ferris wheel. This ferrous refers to the presence of iron in a mineral. A ferrous mineral has iron, a non-ferrous one does not. Etymology: Ferrous comes to us from the Latin ferrum, which means "iron." That's also where the Atomic symbol for iron, Fe, comes from.

## Quartz
Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide).The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO 4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO 2.Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar.. Quartz exists in two forms, the normal α-quartz
