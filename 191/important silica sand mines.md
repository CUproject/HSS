## Silica - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

## Silica Sand - Refractory Silica
Silica sand is an industrial term used for sand or easily disaggregated sandstone with a very high percentage of quartz or silica grains. Silica Sand is dug out of Silica mines and is stored. The deposits of silica are found in our mines situated in JAMSHORO district in Sindh.  Some of the more important physical properties are: grain size
