## What is Machining? - Definition, Process, and Tool
Oct 14, 2021Machining is a manufacturing term encompassing a broad range of technologies and techniques. It can be roughly defined as the process of removing material from a workpiece using power-driven machine tools to shape it into an intended design. Most metal components and parts require some form of machining during the manufacturing process.
