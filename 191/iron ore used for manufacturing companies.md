Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Iron Ore - Majestic Steel USA
WHAT IS IRON ORE? Iron ore is a main component of steel. 98% of all iron ore mined is used to make steel. Additionally, it takes 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce 1 ton of steel. Because of these facts, some have argued, other than oil, iron ore is more integral to the global economy than any other commodity.

## Iron and Steel Manufacturing Industry - Pollution Prevention 
Steel is manufactured by the chemical reduction of iron ore, using an integrated steel manufacturing process or a direct reduction process. In the conventional integrated steel manufacturing process, the iron from the blast furnace is converted to steel in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Steel can also be made in an electric arc furnace (EAF

A blast furnace is fed with coke, iron ore and fluxes, and hot air is blown into the mixture. Air causes the coke to burn, raising temperatures to 1,700 degrees Celsius, which oxidizes impurities. The process reduces the carbon content by 90 percent and results in a molten iron known as hot metal.
