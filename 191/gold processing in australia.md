Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## Gold Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

The lowest grade mine was Evolution's Ernest Henry processing an average head grade of 0.56 g/t. The high-grade operations that do not report an AISC were AuStar Gold's (ASX:AUL) Morning Star mine with 10.26 g/t and Mandalay Resources' (TSE:MND) Costerfield mine with 5.00 g/t.

## Gold Recovery, iCON Gold Recovery, Gravity Concentrators, Centrifugal 
The most important factor in mineral processing is classification; the relative size of the gold you are processing must be known. Mineral processing is expensive and time consuming. Processing large material that is known to have no value costs both money and time. With classification, time, energy and money will not be wasted processing
