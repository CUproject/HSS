Fortunately, at-home testing isn't hard. You have three basic methods at your disposal: Magnetic Testing- Touch a magnet to the specimen. Pyrite is magnetic, gold isn't. Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.

Answer: the short answer is that whatever conditions under which the silica and gold are more soluble in solution are similar. Quartz is amphoteric which means that in a simple aqueous solution, it is more soluble at pHs above and below about 7 (i.e. it's more soluble in acids and bases and has a

The care of rutilated quartz is extremely similar to the care of ordinary quartz. The stone can be cleaned by a warm, damp cloth and jewelry cleaning solutions should usually be avoided. Automatic jewelry cleaning systems such as sonic cleaners should also be avoided.
