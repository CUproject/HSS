1 Transportation Engineering Lab report CRUSHING VALUE OF AGGREGATE TEST THEORY: Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under
