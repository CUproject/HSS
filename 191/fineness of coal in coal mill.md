Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content

## Fineness Of Coal In Coal Mill 6P0x4|Mining Equipment
The fineness of the milling product and the capacity of the pulverizer are strictly connected. With increased fineness grows the overall circulation rate of coal in the mill, coal retention time and the flow resistance. As a result, the maximum mill capacity decreases and the rate of change of operational parameters of the furnace system deteriorates.

To summarize the coal mill controls, they may be divided basically into two major categories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners located on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.
