Dec 15, 2021The life cycle of a recycled concrete product is divided into four phases based on where a process is taking place. The first phase (source/plant) takes in the production of all of the raw materials except for the RA and DCLs. The second phase occurs in a recycling plant where the waste concrete is processed and crushed into RA and DCLs.

Concrete recycling is the use of rubble from demolished concrete structures. Recycling is cheaper and more ecological than trucking rubble to a landfill. Crushed rubble can be used for road gravel, revetments, retaining walls, landscaping gravel, or raw material for new concrete.Large pieces can be used as bricks or slabs, or incorporated with new concrete into structures, a material called

Concrete is reduced in size as it travels down the length of the wedge between the two plates. Jaws are used as primary crushers and typically produce a 4" to 8" minus product usually used as fill. Impact Crushers - Impactors have a spinning rotor with bars or hammers that fling the concrete into a solid plate, several plates, or rods.

## Estimated Cost to Build and Open a Recycling Plant in 2022
1. Land Requirement: $120,000 - $1,000,000. The demand of land depends on what scale your plant will operate. If you choose to operate a small scale recycling plant, then a 50 sq. feet room can also work. But if you choose a large scale recycling plant, then at least 200 to 500 sq. feet of land is required for the recycling process.

C&D waste is made up of wood, steel, concrete, gypsum, masonry, plaster, metal, and asphalt. C&D waste is notable because it can contain hazardous materials such as asbestos and lead. Estimates vary, but a commonly accepted estimate is that between 15% and 20% of municipal solid waste comes from construction and demolition projects
