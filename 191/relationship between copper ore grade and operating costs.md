The History of Gold Mining in North Georgia Gold 'n Gem Grubbin' was North Georgia's last commercially operating Gold Mine and was formerly a productive part of the Loud Mine in Cleveland, GA. It is said that prior to the Civil War, the Loud Mine supplied two of the seven million dollars of minted gold bullion coins at the nearby Dahlonega Mint.

An earlier paper (Crowson, 2003) showed that there has been a statistically significant inverse relationship between copper-equivalent head grades and mine size, based on the tonnage milled. The effect of lower head grades on the costs of metal production has been largely offset by economies of scale.
