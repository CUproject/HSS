## Gold extraction
Concentration. Chemical structure of potassium dicyanoaurate.  A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. These refractory ores require pre-treatment in order

Gold concentrates tend to be mostly iron, so they are also known as "black sands.". Gold concentrates are also made by grinding down ore, quartz, or other productive rock types into sand. This procedure is much faster and easier than panning, but the tradeoff is a final product that has less gold "concentrated" within.
