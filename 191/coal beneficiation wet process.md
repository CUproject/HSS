## Coal Washing Process - JXSC Mineral
The coal beneficiation or coal preparation process separates inorganic impurities from raw mined coal, reducing the concentration of unwanted material or gangue and thereby providing improved combustion characteristics to the fuel produced. The commonly used beneficiation methods for coal sorting and processing include jig separation, heavy medium, and flotation.

## Coal Beneficiation Wet Process
Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.

## Coal beneficiation: Policy priorities for India | ORF
Coal Beneficiation is a process where coal is subjected to a medium of defined specific gravity. Heavier material sinks (rejects) and lighter coal floats (clean coal). This specific gravity is defined by the 'washability' characteristics of the coal seam. It varies for different seams in the same area and for different geographical areas.

To intensify the production of coal, mechanisation of coal mining is gradually increasing. The process, being less selective, increases the quantity of shales, stones and other impurities in coal. Dry methods of separation of these impurities may serve as a preconcentration step prior to wet processes of beneficiation.

A number of improved or newly designed devices have been developedâone of them is a negative pressure pneumatic separator (NPPS). The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.
