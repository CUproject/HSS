## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Fine Aggregate. The particle size ranges from 0.15 mm to 4.75 mm. They can easily pass through a vibrating screen with a 4.75 mm sieve plate and gather on a 0.15 mm sieve plate. Such as artificial sand, natural sand, stone powder, etc. are all fine aggregates. The fine aggregate plays a role in filling the voids with the coarse aggregate in the
