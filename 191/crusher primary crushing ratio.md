## Reduction Ratios in Crushing
Reduction ratio - 10:1. Impact Crushers can be used for either primary or secondary crushing and work by creating a sudden impact force that shatters the material into smaller pieces. They often come as primary crushers (with an 8:1 crushing reduction ratio) or secondary crushers (10:1 reduction ratios) and are perfect for crushing medium-hard

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
