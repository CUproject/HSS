## Conveyor Pulleys - Rolcon Rollers
A conveyor system consists of many moving pieces in different areas. Conveyor pulleys are located near the end of the conveyor or near the motor. Pulleys change the conveyor system's direction of motion and apply drive or tension to the belt. Various belt conveyor pulley types include: Drive. Return. Idler. Snub. Take-up. Bend.

## Conveyor Belt Mistracking Root Causes & Remedies - Martin Eng
A better action is to identify the reason why the belt is mistracking and correct that issue. If adjustments need to be made, they should be made to low-tension rollers. The amount of friction between the low-tension rollers is identified by the drive pulley and the belt. The head pulley and tail pulley should be aligned and square.

1. Turn on the conveyor. While it's running, loosen the bolts that are nearest to the tail pulley. This loosens the snub roller, the primary means of steering the conveyor belt. 2. Using a rubber mallet, tap the bolts gently in the direction that you want the belt to move. This will adjust the snub roller. Make small adjustments until the

## Common Causes of Conveyor Belt Damage - DYNA Engineering
Material Impact Damage. Large and bulky material can cause damage to conveyor rollers, frames and belt. When the material lumps and become large or excessive, rollers become less effective. When the lumps impact between the rollers, the belt is stretched to absorb the forces and causes stress. Over time, the impact can disfigure the belt.
