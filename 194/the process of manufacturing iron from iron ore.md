## Explain in detail the processes involved in the production  - Vedantu
Pig iron can be moulded into different types of shapes. Steel making is defined as a process used for the production of steel from scrap and iron ore. In this process, impurities like sulphur, nitrogen, silicon and excess carbonate are removed from sourced iron. Siemens - Martin and Bessemer have turned steel making into a heavy industry.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Types of Pig Iron and Its Applications for Casting Requirements
Pig iron is an output obtained as a result of the process of manufacturing iron. Fuel coke with high carbon is utilized in order to heat the iron ore. This results in the production of pig iron which is high in carbon content. The cold pig iron is known as merchant pig iron, which is cast into blocks or ingots.

## Steel manufacture
As with all large-scale manufacturing processes, the production or iron and steel generates by-products. On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF/BOF) of by-products. The main by-products produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%), dusts and sludges.

The first step in the steel manufacture begins at the blast furnace. To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal), limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.

## Extraction of Iron | Metallurgy | Blast Furnace and Reactions - BYJUS
At 900 - 1500 K, In the lower sections of the furnace, C + C O 2 → 2 C O. F e O + C O → F e + C O 2. The limestone also decomposes to CaO which removes the silicate impurity of the ore in the form of Slag. It can be easily separated out of molten iron. The iron manufactured in Blast Furnaces contain about 3 - 4 % of Carbon and smaller

Direct Reduced Iron and its Production Processes - IspatGuru . Mar 16 2013 · Fig 1 DRI process principle Major DRI production processes are either gas based or coal based Feed material in a DRI process is either iron ore sized to 10 to 30mm or iron ore pellets produced in an iron ore pellet plant In the gas based plant the reactor the reduction reaction takes place is a shaft furnace
