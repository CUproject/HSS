Gypsum outcrop in Clark County. Gypsum is an evaporite because it precipitates (settles) out of water as the water evaporates. the three varieties of gypsum are selenite, satin spar, and rock gypsum. Selenite, found throughout the Red Hills, has flat, diamond-shaped crystals that can be split into thin sheets.Satin spar is white or pink and fibrous with a silky luster.

## Gypsum Mining in Garbutt - townofwheatland
By the late 1800s many other uses for gypsum had been developed, including water lime cement, plaster board and gypsum blocks. In 1900 the Lycoming Calcining Company bought the Garbutt family gypsum business, and in 1906 the Empire Gypsum Company took over the plaster mine and mill of William Weeks.

## Gypsum Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.

The mine's output was used locally as a cement additive. The Highland mine was purchased by C. W. Harrison of Oklahoma and is now closed and reclaimed.

The mine was worked using the pillar and stall method and employed 40 to 60 people. The mine is now owned by British Gypsum, and although gypsum production ceased in 1989, it still (in 2008) produces anhydrite for use in cement maanufacture.

Gypsum. Gypsum, a white mineral soft enough to be scratched with a fingernail, is hydrated calcium sulfate [Ca(SO 4) 2H 2 O]. Gypsum often begins as calcium sulfate dissolved in an isolated body of salt water.As the water evaporates, the calcium sulfate becomes so concentrated that it can no longer remain in solution and crystallizes out (precipitates) as gypsum.

What is the purpose of gypsum? Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulphate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement, so its is generally termed as retarding agent of cement. It is mainly used for regulating the setting time of cement and is an indispensable component.

Gypsum is a very soft mineral that is easily identified by its hardness, cleavage, and solubility in water. Typically clear to white, gypsum may be colored reddish to brown or yellow if impurities are present. Most gypsum occurs in its massive form, as layers of rock that often intercalate layers of shale, limestone, or dolostone.

## effect of gypsum mining on environment - Capabuild
In the early days of gypsum mining, farmers drove their horses and wagons as far as 100 miles to purchase supplies of "land plaster" for use as fertilizer, or soil "sweetener" as it was called at the time. The primary use of gypsum through this period was as land plaster and fertilizer until about 1880.

Gypsum is considered both a sedimentary rock and a mineral. Its chemical formula is CaSO 4 ∙2H 2 O. Because gypsum formed when ancient seas evaporated in Oklahoma during Permian time ( million years ago), geologists classify it as an evaporite.Western Oklahoma has many large deposits of gypsum totaling trillions of tons (Figure 1).
