## Cutter Suction Dredger - Professional Sand Dredge Manufacturer
Cutter suction dredger makes use of a cutter head to loosen the material to be dredged and pumps the dredged material via a pipeline ashore or into barges. The powerful cutter swings around the spud-pole powered by winches while dredging, then the high pressure sand pump suck up the loosened mixed materials to the destination through the suction pipe.

## Can I just build a dredge out of a trash pump and a sluice box?
It is important that only relatively clean water go into the dredge pump so I put the output of the 3 inch pump into a large bucket, the foot valve for the dredge pump goes into the bucket so that it only sucks up clean water. The overflow of the bucket goes into the hole to keep it full for the nozzle.

A dredges basic setup involves a sluice box mounted between two pontoons, with a motor and pump system and suction hose. The pump creates pressure in the suction hose to vacuum up the gravels from the streambed.

## Dredge Pump Cavitation
Water turns to vapor (vaporizes) when it boils. Sealed in a container such as a dredge pump case, water will vaporize (boil) at ambient temperatures if the pressure in the container is reduced far enough. This is often the situation in the impeller eye area/suction inlet when slurry enters a dredge pump; a sealed container.

The pump housing just isn't large enough to pass larger items. Semi-trash pumps are typically used to pump clean or slightly muddy and sandy water. The largest items any of our semi-trash pumps can pass is about 5/8 of an inch. You'll want to use a hose with a strainer so the hose doesn't get clogged with any items too big to pass through.

While, if you have a large quantity of debris, then you would need a trash pump. The semi-trash pumps are suitable for slightly sandy or muddy water.

DC pumps work great with water (little chance of giving yourself a new "hair do") but you're not going to find one pump that can provide both water volume and water pressure, and you'll need pressure for suction dredging. So, if you want to dredge, you're probably looking at a gas powered water pump.
