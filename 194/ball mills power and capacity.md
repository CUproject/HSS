Nov 16, 2020The acceleration factor of the ball or rod mass is a function of the peripheral speed of the mill. Thus. n = c9np/√D, the above equation becomes P = f1 (D²)·f5 (πD c9 np/√D) = cs np D2.5. As a first approximation, the capacity, T, of a mill may be considered as a function of the force acting inside the mill.

and ball mills, have almost become obsolete in the move to higher milling rates required to process lower metal grades. Grinding circuits with fully autogenous (AG) or semi-autogenous (SAG) mills, often combined with ball mills are now the standard to meet the high capacity requirement for processing ores with lower metal grades.
