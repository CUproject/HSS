## Common Combustion Chamber Designs - From Historical to Hemi
A hemispherical combustion chamber, also known as the HEMI, has a combustion chamber in the shape of a half sphere. The hemispherical combustion chamber has an advantage of cross flow design that allows the engine to breathe better. The hemispherical engines are in use from the early 1900's and were widely used.

## What is Combustion Chamber?- Function, And Types
A Combustion Chamber is the area within the Cylinder where the fuel/air mix is ignited. As the piston compresses the fuel/air mix and makes contact with the Spark Plug, the mixture is combusted and pushed out of the Combustion Chamber in the form of energy. The Cylinder houses many of the important components of an Internal Combustion Engine

A combustor is a component or area of engine where combustion takes place. It is also known as a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion. chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure.

## Any real benefit to polishing combustion chambers? - Don Terrill's 
You would have to measure the surface roughness before and after polishing in order to estimate the thermal benefit. Some combustion chambers are intentionally left in rough, as cast, condition to improve heat transfer. A polished surface has no effect on carbon build-up. Carbon is incredibly sticky and will stick to highly polished surfaces as

## What happens when you polish combustion chambers?
The combustion chamber is exposed to high heat (uo to around 1800F). Any casting flash can create glowing hot spots that can pre ignite the air fuel mixture. Polishing can help eliminate hot spots and some say even reflect heat back. Often unshrouding the valves improves flow, but only done correctly.
