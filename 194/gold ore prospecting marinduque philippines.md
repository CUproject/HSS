## The Philippines: Dangerous and Illegal Compressor Mining
It's true the area has an abundant wealth of high-grade ore. But the work of extracting the region's gold - in measurable quantities - is some of the most dangerous in the Philippines. Because this is a coastal region, much of the clay containing the gold ore is below the water table. This means most mining activity must take place under water.
