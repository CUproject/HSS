## World at work: Marble quarrying in Tuscany | Occupational 
The quarrying industry in the Apuanian Alps directly employs about 1000 workers in the area of Massa Carrara and 200 in Alta Versilia (a small mountainous area in the Province of Lucca), including the transporters of the extracted material from the quarries to the processing and commercialisation locations. The workers are exclusively male.

## Marble
Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite.Marble is typically not foliated (layered), although there are exceptions. In geology, the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone. Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material

Not only did 350 men lose their jobs but a quarrying community and a way of life that had existed since the 1780's changed forever. Everyone in the area had lived in the shadow of Dinorwig.

Due to the texture of marble is loose, the marble quarrying process is different with hard rock. In general, its main processing flow including, choosing materials - reinforced - repair material - cutting - kibble - drying board - gluing and fill holes - drying board - fine grinding - inspection - packing.

Successful carving is a methodical craft and as Rockwell puts it, 'stone is worked by a series of simple steps.'. [2] Each of these steps builds on its predecessor, progressing from initial quarrying, through roughing-out of the overall form, to more and more detailed work and eventually polishing.
