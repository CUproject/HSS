## Alum Manufacturing Techniques & the Affinity Process
Alum can be created through one of several chemical processes. One is by adding aluminum hydroxide Al (OH) 3 to sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4. The chemical reaction is: 2 Al (OH)3 + 3 H2SO4 → Al2(SO4)3 + 6H2O. Translated to plain english, adding 2 molecules of aluminum hydroxide to 3 molecules of sulfuric acid results in 1 molecule of aluminum

##  Growing Alum Crystals
Inspect the alum crystal and solution on a regular basis. If the crystal has stopped growing, and other crystals have formed on the bottom of the solution, remove the crystal and warm the solution to dissolve the additional crystals. If necessary, add small amounts of water (about 2 mL or 1/2 teaspoon) and warm until all the crystals dissolve.

## 3.3 Crystallization of Magma - Physical Geology - 2nd Edition
Figure 3.3.1 The Bowen reaction series describes the process of magma crystallization. Figure 3.3.2 A zoned plagioclase crystal. The central part is calcium-rich and the darker outside part is sodium-rich. In some cases, individual plagioclase crystals can be zoned from calcium-rich in the centre to more sodium-rich around the outside.

## Salt Crystallization - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Sulfate attack of concrete is a complex process, which includes physical salt attack due to salt crystallization and chemical sulfate attack by sulfates from soil, groundwater, or seawater. Sulfate attack can lead to expansion, cracking, strength loss, and disintegration of the concrete. Sulfate attack is generally attributed to the reaction of
