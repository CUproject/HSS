## Grinder Safety - The Do's and Don'ts - Rockford Systems, LLC
Grinder safety gauges can be used during the installation, maintenance, and inspection of bench/pedestal grinders to ensure work-rests and tongue-guards comply with OSHA's 1910.215 regulation and ANSI standards. To do so, wait until the wheel has completely stopped and the grinder is properly locked out before using a grinder safety gauge.

## Toxicity of grinding (steel, carbide, etc)? - Practical Machinist
I grind primarily drills (many), and tool bits (HSS, Cobalt steel). When I grind (HSS, Carbon steel, Carbide, etc), I can not miss the little warning labels: 'use dust collection, grinding dust is toxic'. My understanding is that particles (metal, or grinding abrasives) lodge in the lung (like asbestos), and cause problems.

## GRINDING MACHINE SAFETY - Cad cam Engineering WorldWide
If a grinding wheel becomes cracked, it can fly apart, ejecting chunks of wheel like missiles. To reduce the safety hazards from wheel explosions,wheel guards (Figure L-34) are used on nearly every type of grinding machine. All grinding wheels are rated at a specific maximum rpm. Exceeding rated speeds can cause a wheel to fly apart.
