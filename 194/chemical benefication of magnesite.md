Natural and caustic magnesite can be concentrated by chemical methods to an MgO content of 98%. An analysis of these methods showed that they are technically feasible and economically advantageous.The hydrochloric acid and ammonium methods of beneficiation give not only pure magnesia but also magnesia-based composition materials with a regulatable components proportion including materials in
