Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

Gyratory crushers and cone crushers, while looking the same and performing similar duties, are two different machines.A quick look at a machine will allow you to determine if it is a gyratory or a cone In simple terms, if you look at the top of the crusher and it has supporting arms ("spider arms") going out to the centre of the machine (normally 2 or 3) it's a gyratory.

The cone crusher has 2.5 times higher rotating speed and 4 times larger swinging angle than the gyratory crusher, so the ore is impacted quickly. Therefore, it is advantageous to the ore crushing, the crushing efficiency is high. 2. Different applications. In large quarries, gyratory crushers are often used as primary crushers.

Gyratory Crusher - an overview ScienceDirect Topics Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4 (c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers.

Mar 3, 2021Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar, but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.
