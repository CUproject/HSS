## Integrated Assessment of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining in Ghana 
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining, like other extractive activities, raises numerous environmental concerns. Emissions of mercury (Hg) into the atmosphere as well as direct releases of mercury to soil and water are of primary concern because of the extensive use of mercury to amalgamate gold by artisanal miners.

## Promoting Health and Safety in Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an important source of livelihood for millions of people in the developing world. In Indonesia, some estimates consider around 300,000-1,000,000 artisanal miners to be working at around 1,000 locations across 27 provinces, churning out gold valued at US$5 billion annually, or up to 7% of total

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

In Peru, around 300,000 people work in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, their access to formal banking is limited due to informality and bad perceptions of the sector.
