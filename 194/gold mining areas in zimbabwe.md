## Ground Magnetics, Gold Exploration, Kadoma, Zimbabwe
Objective. QC, process and interpret 168 line km of ground magnetics within the Kadoma area, Zimbabwe. The area is a gold mining area, so detailed structural analysis of the ground magnetics, and targeting, would be required. Ground magnetics data at 200m line spacing with the central area at 50m in-fill spacing.

## History of mining in Zimbabwe | Celebrating Being Zimbabwean - The Patriot
It says: "Zimbabweans have been great miners way before the arrival of the British in the 1880s. Entrepreneur-miners extracted iron ore from the ground. Mining rights were given by the King and his advisors. The minerals mined included gold, copper and iron, for instance. Metallurgist and Iron smith (Mhizha)

## All That Glitters is Not Gold: Turmoil in Zimbabwe's Mining Sector 
Abstract. Violence has spiked in Zimbabwe's gold mining sector, costing hundreds of people their lives and triggering a police operation that led to the arrest of thousands. Media and government blame artisanal miners, who dig using little mechanisation and often without licences but are the country's main gold producers.
