Gold production decreased in the late 1800s, but revived in 1908 by gold dredging operations along the Blue River and Swan River. The Breckenridge mining district is credited with production of about 1,000,000 troy ounces (31 t) of gold.

The price of gold impacts the price of gold mining stocks in a major way. This works great as gold prices rise because gold miners earn more profit, but as gold prices fall, revenues of gold mining operations quickly dry up. In fact, when gold increases, the stock prices of gold miners can increase three times as much.
