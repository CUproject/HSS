## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Crusher Types. There are three common crushers used at mining and processing plants: Gyratory Crushers; Jaw Crushers; Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary

## Jaw Crusher Components & Parts - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Jaw Crusher Parts. Although the jaws do the work, the real heart of the jaw crusher and its components are the toggle plates, the pitman, and the ply wheel. These are the parts and components that generate the crushing action and provide the energy needed to break the ore. Let's follow the chain of events within a crushing cycle to see how

## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher.  The first way is by rotating the bowl against the threads so that the vertical position of the outer wear part (concave) is changed. One advantage of this adjustment
