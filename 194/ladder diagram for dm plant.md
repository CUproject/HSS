## Relays & Ladder Diagrams for NOOBS | All About Circuits
A ladder diagram is always drawn and then read from top to bottom and from left to right. In wiring diagrams and schematics there appears (to me) to be no set proceedure in how they are drawn or read. Also in ladder diagrams it is understood that, in all ladder diagrams, the circuit "as drawn" is in an electrical de-energized state.

By 1971 PLC had spread to other automation industries such as food and beverage, metals and manufacturing, pulp and paper. The conceptual design of PLC:-The first programmable controllers were more or less just relay replacers.
