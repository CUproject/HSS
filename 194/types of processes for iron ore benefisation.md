## Detailed analysis of iron ore beneficiation process
Generally, the combined process of weak magnetic separation and flotation is used to recover iron, sulfide or apatite by flotation.Principle processes are divided into two types: weak magnetic separation-flotation and flotation-weak magnetic separation. The direction of conjoints of magnetite and sulfide in these two processes is different.

## Iron ore beneficiation technology and process
Dec 17, 2020The following summarizes some common iron ore beneficiation processes according to the different properties of the ore: Strong magnetic iron ore 1.Single magnetite. The composition of iron ore of a single magnetite type is simple, and the proportion of iron minerals is very large. Gangue minerals are mostly quartz and silicate minerals.
