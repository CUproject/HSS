## Pre-Bronze-Age Earth must have had sufficient easily accessible 
"Easily accessible" is pretty loose, as is "vast armies" in bronze-age. Take a look at how illegal gold mining works in Africa today, or the amazingly complex mining from the 1500's in De Re Metallica - people have been able to get pretty far underground for a long time.. And remember that "vast armies" are nothing like our standing 1.2 million soldiers, a few thousand could change an empire.

The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (south-western Uganda). The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production. Samples were taken from the six hills of Muko ore deposits and tests carried out to establish their composition and properties.

Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

By far the most important metal from an economic and technical point of view is iron. Sedimentary iron deposits, from which almost all iron is obtained, can therefore be viewed as one of the world's great mineral treasures. There are two major types of deposit. The first, and by far the most important, is banded iron formations (BIFs), so called because they are finely layered alternations

The world's resources are dominated by low-grade ore, though current world production of iron ore is largely by supply from deposits of high-grade ore composed of either rocks of massive hematite or pisolitic goethite. World iron ore production in 2013 was 2.95 billion tonne, with the major producers being China, Australia, and Brazil. Learn More

They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.
