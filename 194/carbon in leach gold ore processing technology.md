Globally, copper, silver, and gold orebody grades have been dropping, and the mineralogy surrounding them has become more diversified and complex. The cyanidation process for gold production has remained dominant for over 130 years because of its selectivity and feasibility in the mining industry. For this reason, the industry has been adjusting its methods for the extraction of gold, by

For many years carbonaceous gold ores have been identified as having the ability to adsorb gold (I) cyanide from leach solutions1-14. This phenomenon, known as preg-robbing, is responsible for poor recoveries as the carbonaceous component of the ore competes with activated carbon used during the leaching and adsorption phase of processing.

## Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold - Mine Engineer.Com
The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns, and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is re-dissolved and removed from the carbon surface.

## carbon in leach gold ore processing technology
The Safe and Effective Use of Cyanide . A process called Cyanidation or cyanide leaching has been the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s In this process sodium cyanide in a dilute solution of ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm or to cyanide is used to selectively dissolve gold from ore The two most common processes that use cyanide for gold
