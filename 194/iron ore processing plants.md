Step 1: Wire drawing. In the first step, our aim is to acquire metal (usually copper or aluminum) wires that fit with AWG (American Wire Gauge). The method is to pull the copper or aluminum rod through a series of synthetic diamond dies, which gradually decrease in size, on the draw bench. And this is processing with a lubricating and cooling.
