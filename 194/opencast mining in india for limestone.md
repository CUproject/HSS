Limestone mining is being implemented by fully mechanized opencast mining methods in all the mines under the study. The working pit has been excavated by developing working benches of 9-10 m in height. Each bench is connected with a ramp. Necessary haul roads have been developed all around the benches for approaching the working faces.
