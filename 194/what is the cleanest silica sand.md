## Different Types of Sand and What They Should be Used for
One of the primary ingredients of sand is silica. This is a naturally occurring material that is found in nearly a quarter of the Earth's crust.  For this reason, all sand used should be clean and free from clay, salts and any other impurities. There is a method of testing the silt content of sand called (funnily enough) the "silt test".

## Understanding the Difference Between Silica Sand and Washed Sand
Silica sand consists of fine pieces of quartz and other minerals such as salt, silt, clay, dust and various powders. Washed sand goes through a cleaning or "washing" process that removes these additional substances. MS Industries is a provider of naturally occurring smaller sized silica sand with microproppants and proppants.

Silica sand is a high-tech mix of properly graded, cleaned & washed sand and a binder compound (yes, it's silica) specially formulated for filling the joints of pavers and slabs. Silica sand has revolutionized the installation of interlocking concrete pavers. It is sand that hardens once activated and has dried yet remains flexible when wet.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.

Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it
