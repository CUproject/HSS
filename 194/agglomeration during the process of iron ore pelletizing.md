This paper presents a novel DEM-SPH method developed for simulating agglomeration and spheronization of powder mixture to produce pellets. Optimal design of iron ore pelletizers, that enables to generate pellets of uniform size and form, is a common challenge and demands a deep insight into the physics of powder mixture accumulation and agglomeration.

## How To Enquiry For Iron Ore Pelletization Plant
Feb 23, 2013 Raw material preparation - During the process for pelletization iron ore concentrate from iron ore beneficiation plant is dried and heated to around 120 deg C. The dried material is fed to the ball mill for grinding. Concentrate ground iron ore of typical size 80 less than 45 microns (0.045 mm) with a moisture content of around 9 is.

Sintering and pelletizing are the processes of major importance for the iron production. During 2014, as per World Steel Association, the production of blast furnace iron and direct reduced iron were 1183 million tons and 73 million tons respectively. Most of this production has come from iron ore in the form of sinter and pellet.
