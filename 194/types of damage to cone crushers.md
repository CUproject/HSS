Mar 2, 2021For performance efficiencies, proper circuitry should be designed around the crusher cone, says Schultz. Importantly, the circuit should be engineered to provide the crusher cone with choke-fed material, or enough material to keep the crusher full. Having too little feed can cause the crusher to side load, which stresses components.

Jul 23, 2021Impact. Impact crushers mill the material with speed! The belt feeds the impact crusher; from there, the crusher flings the rock against breaker bars to pulverize the material. While a jaw crusher "chews" and a cone crusher squeezes, an impact rotates the material at intense speeds to break it down in its final stage.
