Mar 2, 2021For performance efficiencies, proper circuitry should be designed around the crusher cone, says Schultz. Importantly, the circuit should be engineered to provide the crusher cone with choke-fed material, or enough material to keep the crusher full. Having too little feed can cause the crusher to side load, which stresses components.
