Sulfides consist of copper, sulfur and iron. Since copper metal is more easily extracted from the carbenate and sulfide minerals,

## Steelmaking and Refining | Introduction to Chemistry | | Course Hero
Modern steelmaking processes are broken into two categories: primary and secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking uses mostly new iron as the feedstock, usually from a blast furnace. Secondary steelmaking is performed in an electric arc furnace and uses scrap steel as the primary raw material. Refining consists of purifying an impure metal.

The most important functions of secondary refining are final desulfurization, degassing of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc., removal of inclusions, and final decarburization for ultra-low carbon steel. Desulfurization is conducted by adding CaO, Na 2 CO 3, CaF 2, etc. in a similar manner to that used in the hot metal pretreatment process.

Electrolytic refining is a process of refining a metal (mainly copper) by the process of electrolysis. As far as the mechanism of the process is concerned, during electrolysis, a large chunk or slab of impure metal is used as the anode with a thin strip of pure metal at the cathode. In this setup, an electrolyte (metal salt aqueous solution

In refining copper, the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities, most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.
