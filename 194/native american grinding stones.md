Native Californians differ on the use of the name "grinding rock." Some prefer to call such rocks "pounding rocks," since acorns were really pounded into meal rather than ground. Others call them "bedrock mortars," because the rocks served as a mortar against which women pounded the dried acorns using a stone pestle.
