Greek Bauxite / Ore deposit geology/ Mining-Production. The bauxite deposits in Greece are of "karst" type. They were created by the lateritic weathering of basic, mainly, members (basalts, diabases, gabbros) of the ophiolite complexes, which abound in the Subpelagonian Zone. The largest deposits of bauxite, in Greece, can be found in the

## Mining and Refining - Process - World Aluminium
Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

Trains rest on tracks near Kamsar's port after completing their 120-km long journey from the mining area in Sangaredi. Five to seven trains, each equipped with 120 wagons, leave that mine every day. Each wagon contains around 82 tons of bauxite ore, amounting to between 49,200 and 68,800 tons of bauxite shipped, by railway alone, daily.

## Bauxite - Official Satisfactory Wiki
Bauxite is a late-game ore found in the world. It is the raw ore of Aluminum, combining it with Water in a Refinery produces Alumina Solution for further processing. Bauxite can be harvested by hand (default E) in trace amounts from resource deposits scattered across the world, or from inexhaustible resource nodes on which Miners can be constructed to extract automatically. Additonally, Lizard

## The mining industry as a net beneficiary of a global tax on carbon 
Feb 3, 2022Like bauxite miners and aluminum producers, there is a major CO 2 emissions difference between the raw mining of coking coal and iron ore and the smelting of finished metal production. This
