## Coal in South Africa
The coal industry is South Africa's largest contribution to the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. [4] [3] Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal. [5] South Africa is the 5th largest exporter of coal in the world, with 30% consumed overseas. [3] 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is produced

Therefore, Mining is a very profitable sector and it also creates employment opportunities; factors which help improve the socio-economic standards of the country. However, despite these benefits, the nature of mining has a negative long-term effect on the environment and its people during and years after the mines are closed.

## Coal Mining in Africa
The History of Coal Mining. Coal was used in South Africa as far back as the Iron Age (300 - 1880 AD). During this time charcoal was used to melt copper and iron. Large-scale usage of coal only started happening around the middle of the 19th century. Coal mining has undergone major development over the years.

In 2013, coal contributed R51 billion to South Africa's economy, compared with gold's R31 billion 1. Measured at current prices, coal is now king. The mineral's contribution to overall mining value added rose to 22,5% in 2013 from 17,4% in 1993. Platinum group metals (PGMs) came a close second in 2013, at 21,0%.

## Environmental impacts associated with an abandoned mine  - ScienceDirect
An increase in the natural moisture content of coal can liberate heat, and greater surface area and air permeation have the same effect. If the pyrite content of coal exceeds 2%, then, this also aids the self-heating process as oxidation of pyrite also is an exothermic reation. Mining creates pathways through which air can be carried to coal.

Air Pollution: One of the most obvious negative effect of Coal is that it causes air pollution. With the burning of coal, there is a high probability of having associated air pollution with the usage of coal. Water pollution: Just like air pollution, water pollution is also a major reason that makes it difficult to cope with the burning of coal.
