## Gold Ore Roasting Plant - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The gold ore is double-refractory. First, the gold is locked in sulfide mineral particles that must be oxidized to expose the gold for leaching.  Dust is carried over the first stage cyclone separators in the roaster off-gas (about 3% to 4.5% of the dry ore feed depending on the off-gas rate).  The ore processing activities (such as
