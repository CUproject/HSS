## The gold mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Miners, mining materials and equipment are transported deep underground via the mine cage in the vertical shaft, which can go to depths of up to 3.5km below the surface. Open-pit gold mining also takes place in South Africa. This is a mining technique which excavates at the surface to extract ore.
