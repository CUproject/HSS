## Friction angle of crushed rock - Geotechnical engineering general 
The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size. Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous. I would use a safe 36 degrees unless a direct shear test is performed on a sample. There's at-rest earth pressure and active earth pressure.

## Calculating the Weight of Stone (U.S. National Park Service)
Sep 27, 2021For example: If the stone you are working with is granite that is approximately .64ft3 your calculation should look like the following; ft3 x lbs/ft3 = lbs so your calculation would be; minimum lbs= .64 x 159 = 101.8, maximum lbs = .64 x 180 = 115.1 Therefore the granite is between 101.8 and 115.1 pounds. The weight is given in a range because not all stones of the same type weigh the same.
