## CNB - Positive flotation method for bauxite - Google Patents
The invention discloses a positive flotation method for bauxite, and relates to an improvement on an ore dressing method for bauxite. The flotation method comprises the steps of ore grinding, grading and flotation. The method is characterized in that: original ore pulp obtained by grinding and grading the bauxite is sprayed into a scavenging foam collecting tank in the flotation process to

## A novel collector RL for flotation of bauxite | Semantic Scholar
The flotation properties of single minerals such as diaspore, kaolinite and pyrophllite in bauxites were investigated using RL as collector. The effects of regulators and unavoidable ions on flotation were studied. Based on the results of single minerals flotation, the separation experiments of mixed minerals and bauxite ore were carried out. The results of closed circuit test on the ore show

Aug 12, 2022Flotation for bauxite. The bauxite deposits in different regions are slightly different. Take China as an example, most of China's bauxite is diaspore bauxite, which has the characteristics of high aluminum, high silicon, and low iron. Illite, pyrophyllite and kaolinite are the main silica-bearing minerals in Chinese ores.

## The Impact of Backwater Iron Ions on Bauxite Flotation
There are 4.71 billion tons of bauxite ores reserves in China until 2015 [], and the majority is diaspore bauxite, which has a low ratio of alumina to silica (A/S).Diaspore bauxite was unsuitable for direct extraction of alumina with Bayer process and the Bayer-mineral processing method was developed to be a new approach to make better use of diaspore bauxite by Chinese scientists.

The United States is import-reliant for nearly all of the bauxite that it consumes. Small amounts of bauxite and bauxitic clays are produced in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia for nonmetallurgical uses. Metallurgical-grade bauxite (crude dry) imports in 2011 totaled 9.54 Mt (10.5 million st), 18 percent more than the quantity imported in 2010.

The minerals from which the metals can be conveniently and economically extracted are known as ores. All the ores arc minerals but all minerals cannot be ores, e.g., both bauxite (Al 2 O 3.xH2O) and clay (Al 2 O 3.2SiO 2.2H 2 O) are minerals of aluminium . It is bauxite which is used for extraction of aluminium</b> and not clay.

Because the desired product is a high purity Al2O3, the remaining oxides in the bauxite (Fe2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Organic material) are separated from the Al2O3 and rejected as alumina refinery resides (ARR) or red mud. In general, the lower quality the bauxite (ie lower Al2O3 content) the more red mud is generated per ton of alumina product.

## Flotation Desulfurization of Acidified High-Sulfur Bauxite: Effects of 
Feb 24, 2021The desulfurization of high-sulfur bauxite via flotation is more difficult than conventional sulphide, since the finely disseminated sulphide in the high-sulfur bauxite can lead to excessive particle entrainment, increase of froth, and low separation efficiency. Acidification of high-sulfur bauxite resulting in changes in mineral surface

The flotation response of gibbsitics bauxite ores with and without desliming is discussed with respect to flotation strategy, mineralogy, and liberation characteristics. Efforts are now being made to develop improved flotation technology for the efficient processing of low grade bauxite ores. Such resources are classified according to the

1.1. Flotation of Bauxite Ores in Industry The first flotation plant for bauxite processing was installed in Zhongzhou, Henan Province, China. The ore contains 65% diaspore as the primary bauxite mineral with kaolinite, illite and pyrophillite as the gangue silicate minerals. A grinding circuit with cyclones reduces the ore size and eliminates

## Separation of silica from bauxite via froth flotation - ScienceDirect
Bauxite is the main raw material in primary aluminum production and its reactive silica content and mass ratio of Al 2 O 3 to SiO 2 (A/S) has a critical role in the economic viability of Bayer process. As a major source of the reactive silica, clay impurities should be removed from the ore as much as possible by a beneficiation method such as froth flotation before the Bayer processing.

3.1.2 Bauxite Flotation Bayer Process China began to do research work on the bauxite flotation process from the 1970s. A Bauxite Flotation Bayer process line with a capacity of 300kt/a alumina was constructed and put into operation in Chalco's Zhongzhou operations in 2004. It was the world's first industrialization of.
