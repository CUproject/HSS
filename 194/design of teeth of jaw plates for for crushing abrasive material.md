## Jaw Plate Failure and Life - Crushing, Screening & Conveying 
Too many fines can accelerate jaw plate wear. What happens is the fines will fill the jaw plate corrugations or valleys. These valleys are necessary for the crusher to crush efficiently. Filling the valleys with fines creates an event called compaction. Normally a jaw crusher will squeeze the material between the stationary and moving jaw plates.
