4. Find-out quantity of Sand: How many bags of cement for 1 cubic meter of concrete? We have considered an entrained air of 2%. Thus the actual volume of concrete for 1 cubic meter of compacted concrete construction will be = 1 -0.02 = 0.98 m3. Thus, the quantity of cement required for 1 cubic meter of concrete = 0.98/0.1345 = 7.29 bags of cement.

The, in accordance with the code, this calculator uses the absolute volume method to calculate the volume of fine aggregates. Briefly, the total volume of all ingredients and air except fine aggregate is 0.702 m3. Hence, the volume of fine aggregate is equal to the unit volume (1 m3) minus 0.702, which yields about 0.297 m3.

How to Calculate a Concrete Weight | Sciencing + Sep 24, 2019Â· The density of normal concrete is 2400 kg/m 3, and for lightweight concrete, 1750 kg/m 3. For comparison, the density of steel is 7850 kg/m 3. That means you can multiple these densities by volume in m 3 to determine the

## Concrete Calculator - Find How Much Concrete You Need | ProEst
To calculate concrete, you solve for volume and then convert this to cubic yards. First, determine how much concrete you need, then measure the length and width you would like to cover and multiply the two to determine the square footage. Measure the thickness in feet and multiply it by the square footage to determine the cubic feet.

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Aggregate required for 1  - Happho
The volume proportion in weight turns out to be. Cement : Sand : Aggregate (in Kgs) is 50 kgs : 115 kgs : 209 kgs (by weight) Water required for the mixture = 27.5 kgs. Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum
