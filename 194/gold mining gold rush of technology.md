## gold mining gold rush of technology
Apr 29, 2014 The gold mining technology in the early years was very simply. It consisted largely of manual labor and primitive tools for little to no reward. Made famous in the California Gold Rush and the Colorado Gold Rush, Placer Mining takes a variety of forms and steps, including panning, "sluice-boxing", hydraulic mining, and dredging.

## Pike's Peak Gold Rush
The Pike's Peak Gold Rush (later known as the Colorado Gold Rush) was the boom in gold prospecting and mining in the Pike's Peak Country of western Kansas Territory and southwestern Nebraska Territory of the United States that began in July 1858 and lasted until roughly the creation of the Colorado Territory on February 28, 1861.

## The American History of Gold Mining - American Bullion
The California Gold Rush, which is an important factor in the history of the United States, did not begin until 1848. California history tells us that this phenomenal era of extracting gold nuggets from the earth took place in the Sierra Nevada area. Gold was referred to as the "noble metal" and it comes in two forms, that of pure and impure.
