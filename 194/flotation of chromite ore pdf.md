## TREATING CHROME TAILINGS FOR PGMs
The mines, in upgrading the chromite content of their ore, produce a tailings stream that contains the majority of the PGMs of the ROM chrome ores. It is these chrome ores with elevated levels of PGMs that are treated.  This is followed by flotation banks comprising 10 cleaner and five recleaner cells that take the concentrate recovery level

Abstract The UG2 reef of the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa is a valuable source of platinum group metals (PGMs) that is beneficiated by flotation. Chromite is one of the main gangue consituents of UG2 ore and it is essential that the amount of chromite reporting to the concentrate during flotation be minimised since it is detrimental to the subsequent smelting operations.

Chromite is one of the main gangue consituents of UG2 ore and it is essential that the amount of chromite reporting to the concentrate during flotation be minimised since it is detrimental to the subsequent smelting operations. It is generally considered that chromite is naturally hydrophilic and only reports to the concentrate by entrainment.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## flotation of chromite ore
1986/08/01¬∑ The US Bureau of Mines compared column flotation using either fine or coarse bubbles with conventional flotation on a Montana chromite ore. On deslimed ore, fine-bubble column flotation produced a 44.7% Cr 2 O 3-grade rougher concentrate with 87% recovery, compared with 43.8% and 43.5% Cr 2 O 3-grade rougher concentrates .

(1981). Most of the world's chromite is produced from stratiform deposits in South Africa and Rhodesia and from podiform de¬≠ posits in alpine peridotites in the Soviet Union. The Stillwater Complex, a stratiform complex in Montana, contains substan¬≠ tial tonnages of chromite, but the ore has a low Cr2 03 content
