##  Mineralogy and Pollution Status of Columbite-Tin Ore Contaminated Soil
unregulated mining activities poses threats to the environment and human. This research focus on the mineral characterization of Tin-Columbite contaminated soil. The study also investigates dearth information on the classes of contaminants and the compounds that are unearthed as a result of mining activities.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

Feb 26, 2022Method of mining tin and Columbite. Tin and Columbite are mined by a method called open cast method. The process of mining is as follows. Explosives are used to remove the overburden rocks. A powerful machine called a dragline is then used to pile the tin into a heap. A monitor is then used to direct a strong jet of water towards the heap.

The iron-rich member of the columbite group is ferrocolumbite. Some tin and tungsten may be present in the mineral. Yttrocolumbite is the yttrium-rich columbite with the formula (Y,U,Fe)(Nb,Ta)O4. It is a radioactive mineral found in Mozambique. Columbite has the same composition and crystal symmetry (orthorombic) as tantalite.

May 23, 2021Solid minerals contributed immensely to the economic development of Nigeria in the pre-independence years. During this period, Nigeria was known for the production of coal as an energy source for electricity, railways and also for export. Tin, Columbite, Lead and Zinc were exported. Nigeria was the largest producer of Columbite at one point.

## Cleaning up tin mining in Indonesia | ArcelorMittal
Mining is increasingly happening offshore, where dredging is causing damage to reefs and marine life - and to the fishing industry. Large-scale mining has left pockets of land barren. And frequent informal mining, with small-scale miners hunting for tin in abandoned mines, is unsafe and hard to regulate.

## Effects of columbite/tantalite (COLTAN) mining activities on water 
The mining of columbite/tantalite (COLTAN) has a negative effect on the different spheres of the environment notably; hydrosphere, lithosphere, and the atmosphere (Eisler 2004). Just like gold mining, COLTAN extraction involves the breaking of crystallographic bond in the mineral ore to get the products in the pure form.
