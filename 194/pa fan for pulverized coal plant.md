## Pulverized Coal System Advantages and Disadvantages - Melezy
Jul 8, 2021Advantages of pulverized coal firing. (1) Greater surface area per unit mass of coal allows faster combustion reactions because more carbon becomes exposed to heat and oxygen. This reduces the excess air needed to complete combustion. (2) Less excess air is required for complete combustion because of greater surface area of fuel exposed.

## Pulverised Coal Combustion with higher efficiency - CTCN
Producing electricity in coal power plants can take place in a number of ways with varying degrees of efficiency. In conventional coal-fired plants coal is first pulverised into a fine powder and then combusted at temperatures of between 1300 and 1700 o C. This process heats water in tubes in the boiler so that it becomes steam at a pressure of around 180 bar and a temperature of 540 o C.

Early Air Pollution in England In 1306, to clean up London's air, King Edward I, outlawed coal burning exclaiming ".whosoever shall be found guilty of burning coal shall suffer the loss of his head." After deforestation, rather than freeze and starve, people began burning c0al again. In 1590, Queen Elizabeth bans burning coal again

## To Improve Thermal Efficiency of 27mw Coal Fired Power Plant
The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station, considered as salable energy as a percent of the heating value of the fuel consumed, is typically 33% to 48%. This efficiency is limited as all heat engines are governed by the laws of thermodynamics. The rest of the energy must leave the plant in the form of heat.

## Draught Fans Used in Thermal Power Plants - Reitz India
The main function of the Primary air fan or PA fan is to carry the pulverized coal to the furnace as fuel for combustion. This process is used to create the steam that is the primary process in the thermal power plant. In power plants, the PA fans supply air for conveying of the pulverized coal from coal mills to the furnace area.

## Types of Centrifugal Fans Used in Power Plant | Blowerfab
In power plants, PA fans supply air for conveying of the pulverized coal from coal mills to the furnace area. These fans produce pressure upstream of the pulverizer, to push the coal and air mixture through the pulverizer into the furnace. Backward Curved Centrifugal Fan is the most common centrifugal fan used as a PA fan in a boiler power plant.

## how to maintain the pa fan pressure in pulverized boiler
 In power plants, the PA fans supply air for conveying of the pulverized coal from coal mills to the furnace area. These primary air fans produce a high pressure to push the coal and air mixture through pulverizer into the furnace. The most common configuration of the draught fans used as a PA fan is the backward curved centrifugal fan.
