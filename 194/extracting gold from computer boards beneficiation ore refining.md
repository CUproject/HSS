Mining has advanced primarily through the use of two strategies: pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. Both have been used successfully to extract valuable metals from ore deposits. These strategies, without a doubt, harm the environment. Furthermore, due to decades of excessive mining, there has been a global decline in high-grade ores.

## The true cost of producing an ounce of gold | Provident
These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.

## Gold Extraction Techniques - Manhattan Gold & Silver
One of the earliest methods for extracting gold, salt cementation, was perfected through the Iron Age. When the Lydian Empire was standardizing the purity of the gold and silver they were using for the world's earliest coinage, this was the method they relied on. When mined, gold is commonly merged with silver as an alloy called electrum.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
