## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

Ugandan authorities said on Wednesday they are investigating the country's biggest gold refinery over recent imports of an estimated 7.4 tonnes of gold, worth some $300 million. Ugandan state-run media has reported the gold could have originated from Venezuela, which has been selling gold to prop up its struggling, sanctions-hit economy.

These techniques of refining gold eventually reached the Spanish by 100 AD, who may have been just as mystified with the precious metal as Indians are today. Gold Ore Processing: Project Development and Operations, edited by Mike D. Adams speculated that up to 40,000 slaves were employed for gold mining in Spain at the time.

Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception. During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the

Cupellation is a process that purifies ores by separating gold and silver from base metals and other impurities. The process makes use of a cupel - a high temperature resistant flat bowl. The ore is placed in this cupel which is put in a special furnace. Hot air is then passed through it to remove the impurities.

## How the Gold Refining Process Works | Global Bullion
The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold - Manhattan Gold & Silver
In metal refining, a flux is sort of like a cleaning agent because it helps remove impurities from a sample. With some borax, heat, and a little know-how, it's possible to extract pure gold from a sample of ore. This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore, including gold.
