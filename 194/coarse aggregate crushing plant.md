For example coarse aggregate has a standard grading requirement for each different size from #1 to #8. A #1 aggregate is a nominal size of 3 ½ to 1 ½ inches and a #8 aggregate is a nominal size of 3/8 to 0.094 inch. More specifically, a #57 aggregate is the combination of #5 and #7 aggregates ranging from 1 to 0.19 inch.
