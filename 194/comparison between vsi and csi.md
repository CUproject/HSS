## Vfd voltage outputceforlifefo
It is possible to input single phase (230 volt) power to a VFD and output variable voltage to a 3-phase induction motor. The VFD can be treated as a phase converter. Sometimes in rural areas or older facilities, single phase input voltage is all that is available. The good news is that a VFD can be powered off of this single phase input voltage.

VS1 vs VVS2: Differences in price. There aren't many differences between VS1 and VVS2 diamonds, but you'll pay different prices depending on which clarity grade you decide on. Diamonds in the VVS2 range are considered the best value of the higher clarities — and it won't compromise your diamond's brilliance.

A key difference between CSI drives and VSI drives is their energy storage method. CSI drives use inductive energy storage—that is, they use inductors in their DC link to store DC energy and regulate current ripple between the converter and the inverter. Conversely, VSI drives use capacitive storage, with capacitors in their DC link, which

3. Power semiconductor devices such as GTOS, power transistor, power MOSFETs cannot be used in a CSI, but in VSI these devices can be used. 4. CSI is more reliable and rugged than VSI. 5. CSI is a wave suitable for low leakage impedance, a high leakage impedance produces voltage spikes which can dangerous for the device.

## Comparison of VSI and CSI topologies for single-phase active power 
This paper explores design considerations and relative merits of the voltage-source inverter (VSI) and current-source inverter (CSI) topologies for single-phase active power filter applications. While the VSI has largely overtaken the CSI as the inverter of choice for many applications, the CSI is shown to have certain advantages for single-phase active power filtering.
