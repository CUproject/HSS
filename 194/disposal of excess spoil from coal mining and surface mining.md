## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Disposal Of Excess Spoil From Coal Mining And Surface Mining
Dec 12, 2008 The Hill & Associates report uses the term "deep mines" for underground mines and the term "wash plants" for coal preparation plants. In addition, in the report, the term "valley fills" includes all excess spoil fills and coal mine waste disposal facilities constructed as part of a surface mine

In some cases underground mining also produces enough spoil to require the construction of valley fills. Mountaintop and area mining allows for almost complete recovery of coal seams, and reduces the number of workers required to a fraction of what conventional methods require but produces large volumes of excess spoil disposal needs.

Prior to the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.
