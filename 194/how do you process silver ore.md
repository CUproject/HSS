## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

## Patio process
The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

## Common Silver Extraction Methods - Mining-pedia
The common gold-silver ore extraction process has the following types: 1. Flotation + Flotation concentrate cyanidation. The sulfide ore containing gold, silver and quartz veins is subjected to flotation process to obtain a small amount of concentrate, which is then sent to cyanidation process.

## How Do You Process Silver Ore.pl
The first stage of mining silver involves the crushing the silver ore to about 1-1.5in diameter so as to make the ore porous for the extraction process. Once the ore is crushed it is then mixed with lime (about 3-5 lb. per ton) to create a conducive alkaline conditions for the extractions.
