## Conveyor Choices—Drag, Belt or Pneumatic? - Biomass Engineering & Equipment
Belt conveyors are also "leaky," so sawdust will fall between belt sections and potentially scatter through the air. There's also no need for a belt conveyor because sawdust mustn't be handled gently. So, manufacturers often opt to use pneumatic conveyors to transport the sawdust. Pellet Mill Pneumatic Conveyors

Easy access for maintenance adjustment. Maintenance adjustment on a rack and pinion system is done from the side of the conveyor frame. Generally, this area is more open than the end. In addition, the pinion can be accessed from either side of the frame. Therefore, if one side is blocked by an accessory, the other side may be open.
