Dec 6, 2020During an impact, the energy of a moving object is converted into work, and force plays an important role. To create an equation for the force of any impact, you can set the equations for energy and work equal to each other and solve for force. From there, calculating the force of an impact is relatively easy.

## How would you calculate the force of a hammer hitting an anvil?
The force between hammer and anvil is, indeed, very difficult to calculate. There are two significantly different cases: 1) where the interaction is elastic (no permanent deformation of either the hammer or the anvil; and 2) where the interaction is inelastic (e.g., the hammer leaves a dent in the anvil).

Regulatory Requirements. The regulatory requirements are pretty straightforward: OSHA requires that M.A.F. be limited to 1800 lbs. of force on the body in a fall when wearing a full-body harness, or 900 lbs. of force when wearing a body belt. However, in 1998, OSHA prohibited the use of body-belts with fall arrest systems.
