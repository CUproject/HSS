## Use of manganese in batteries - SENET
Why Use Manganese in Batteries? "Manganese is ideal for use in batteries due to its natural ionic state. This gives it an enhanced capacity to hold and discharge electrons," advises Dempers. "Because manganese is very cost effective (over 40 times cheaper than cobalt), it offers an affordable alternative for battery production.".

A lithium-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery. It has four key parts: The cathode (the positive side), typically a combination of nickel, manganese, and cobalt oxides; The anode (the negative side), commonly made out of graphite, the same material found in many pencils; A separator that prevents contact between the anode and cathode; A chemical solution known as an electrolyte that

## Why Should You Use Alkaline Batteries in Your Application?
Alkaline batteries are composed primarily of common metals such as steel, zinc, and manganese and do not pose a health or environmental risk during normal use or disposal. Since the early 1990's mercury has been removed from the chemistry makeup, so they can safely be disposed with normal household waste, everywhere but California.

## Alkaline battery
The actual zero-load voltage of a new alkaline battery ranges from 1.50 to 1.65 V, depending on the purity of the manganese dioxide used and the contents of zinc oxide in the electrolyte. The voltage delivered to a load decreases as the current drawn increases and as the cell discharges.  The use of disposable batteries increases by 5-6%

Jul 25, 2022Disposables Store Energy Longer. Disposable batteries typically store energy longer compared to rechargeable ones. This is because disposables often have low self-discharge, holding up to 90% of their charge for years. Depending on the materials used, disposable batteries can hold a charge for years after post-production.
