## What Is The Fineness Modulus Of Manufactured Sand
Define Fineness Modulus Of Sand. Jul 31 2016 Fineness modulus of sand fine aggregate is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand. It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves. The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.

## Is code fineness modulus of sand? - Sage-Answer
The Fineness Modulus of Sand is an index number that indicates the mean size of the sand particles. It is calculated by performing the sieve analysis test with standard IS sieves. The fineness modulus of sand ranges from 2.2 to 3.2. To find the fineness modulus of fine aggregate required IS sieve are sizes of 4.75mm.

## What is fineness modulus of cement?sewing
Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand. It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves . The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.

Medium sand: fineness modulus is 3.0-2.3, and average particle size is 0.5-0.35 mm. Fine sand: fineness modulus is 2.2-1. 6, and average particle diameter is 0.35-0.25 mm.

## Grading of Aggregate and Fineness Modulus of grading of aggregate
Fineness Modulus of grading of aggregate. The fineness modulus is an empirical factor computed from the sieve analysis. It is defined as the sum of the cumulative percentages retained on the sieves of the standard series ranging from 80mm to 150microns and dividing the sum by 100. When all particles in a sample are coarser than say 600µm, the
