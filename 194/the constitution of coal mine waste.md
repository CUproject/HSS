## Coal waste - Global Energy Monitor
Coal mining and coal combustion in power plants produce several types of wastes: The mining process itself produces waste coal or solid mining refuse, which is a mixture of coal and rock.; The mining process also produces liquid coal waste, which is then stored in impoundments.; Pollution control equipment used for coal combustion produces coal ash or fly ash, as well as flue-gas

Rock or Solid Mine Waste. Open pit mining has several stages of waste. First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore.

## Waste Coal | Energy Justice Network
What is waste coal? Waste coals are the low-energy-value discards of the coal mining industry. Waste coal is called "culm" in the eastern Pennsylvania anthracite coal region and "gob" or "boney" in the bitiminous coal mining regions (western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and elsewhere). Waste coal piles accumulated mostly between 1900 and 1970.

##  Impact of a coal mine waste discharge on water quality and aquatic 
Underground and open-cut coal mining generates large volumes of waste water which is often contaminated by underground and surface processes associated with mining activity (Johnson, 2003). Coal is a valuable resource to the NSW economy and in 2009/10 accounted for $13.2 billion in income, employed more than 2013).

## Mining Waste | Special Wastes | Wastes | US EPA
October 2, 1985 —EPA proposes in the Federal Register (50 FR 40292) to reinterpret the scope of the mining waste exclusion as it applies to mineral and ore processing wastes, leaving only large-volume processing wastes excluded. Other mineral and ore processing wastes that are hazardous would be subject to full RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous
