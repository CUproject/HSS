## Sandy Ridge Facility site - Tellus Holdings
The Sandy Ridge Project is Australia's first dual open-cut kaolin mine and arid near-surface geological waste repository in a 70-million-year-old kaolin clay bed, on top of some of the oldest and most stable rocks on earth which formed approximately 3.7 billion years ago. The Sandy Ridge Project is located approximately 240 kilometres (km

## Kaolin | Imerys - Imerys Performance Minerals
Kaolin, or 'china clay' as it is commonly called, is a hydrated aluminum silicate crystalline mineral formed over many millions of years by the hydrothermal decomposition of granite rocks. Hydrous kaolin is characterized by its fine particle size, plate-like or lamellar particle shape and chemical inertness.
