Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## A Look Into Carving Limestone
Wet the Stone. Limestone is formed in water, and wetting it makes it more malleable. It may be more prone to breakage, which is good for carving but can be detrimental to the overall shape. Check for cracks in your stone prior to wetting it, as those cracks indicate where pieces could break off when wet or being carved.
