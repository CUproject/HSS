## The Copper Industry in India | Consult MCG
Copper is one of the most widely used metals in India and its usage is next only to steel and aluminium in volume terms. Domestic consumption of refined copper is estimated at around 600,000 tonnes for and this constitutes roughly 3% of the global usage. Per capita consumption of copper (including refined and recycled) in India is low at around 0.5 kg, as against a world average of 2.7 kg.

## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Copper production in India is only about 2 percent of world copper production in view of its potential reserve limited to 60,000 km 2 (2% of world reserve) of which 20,000 km 2 area has been subject to exploration, as of 2012.
