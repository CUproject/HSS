## Chute Conveyor System in Material Handling - OpEx Learning Resources
In general, a chute conveyor is ideal for the following: Unit/Bulk + On-Floor + Accumulate. Inexpensive. Used to link two handling devices. Used to provide accumulation in shipping areas. Used to convey items between floors. Difficult to control position of the items. Main method of transport is gravity, making a chute conveyor very inexpensive.

All coal burned at the plant moves through a single chute. The path is at an angle of roughly 90 degrees from either of the discharging conveyors, making for a difficult transfer. A drop height of 30 feet also creates problems, including a large flow of induced air, resulting in dust escape, high levels of impact leading to idler damage and belt abrasion from poor control of the flow of coal.
