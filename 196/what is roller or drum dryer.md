## What lubricant, if any, should be used for clothes dryer rollers?
It seems I may have used the wrong lubricant for my LG clothes dryer rollers because the rollers kept seizing up. Since these rollers are simple and there are no bearings I did not put much thought into what lubricant to use:

## Dryer roller squeals badly. Is there a lubricant I can use?
I bought replacement rollers on the cheap from amazon only to find out the one roller in question was so tight that the dryer frame was warping as I attempted to muscle it loose. So on it stayed. I lubed it with WD40 (hindsight, so stupid due to flammability). It was fine for about 4 months but now it squeals so bad we can't use the dryer.

## What To Check If Your Dryer Making Noise?
Overtime the drum roller axles can become worn out. When this occurs people commonly complain of a loud rumbling noise. If you want to check your drum roller axles, you'll need to remove the drive belt from the drum and try turning it by hand. If you notice the drum doesn't spin freely you'll first want to look at the support rollers.

The advantages of drum drying include [12]: 1. The products have good porosity and, hence, good rehydration due to boiling evaporation. 2.

The drum rollers of your dryer are made of rubber and steel. The rollers support the weight of the clothes, so if the drum itself is out of balance, those rollers could wobble — and even eventually bend or break. Wobbling can also be caused by faulty axles that no longer hang straight in their bearings. If the dryer does not spin evenly, this

## Why Is My Dryer Squeaking Really Loud?evitamin
A dryer can make a loud squeaking noise if a part called the idler pulley is not functioning properly.The idler pulley puts tension on the drum belt to keep it from slipping while the dryer is spinning. Friction build-up can cause the pulley to wear out and is often responsible for a squeaking noise.
