Copper is a chemical element in the periodic table with the symbol Cu (from the Latin word cuprum, meaning 'metal of Cyprus,' where it was mined during the Roman era). Copper has an atomic number of 29 and atomic weight of 63.54 grams per mole. It is an element in Group 11 of the periodic table, sharing many properties with silver and gold.

## Smelting Copper Ore Process
A typical copper ore contains between 0.5 and 2.0 copper. a high grade ore produces a high yield of metal. a low grade order produces a low yield of metal. copper can be extracted from sulfide ores (usually higher grade ores) by direct smelting. the earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 bc.

## Why is there a concern about copper smelting plants? - Testbook
5 days agoSmelting is the process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. Copper smelting plants separate elemental copper from copper concentrates through multiple sulphide oxidizing stages. Most copper ores are sulphur-based and smelting releases sulphur dioxide, an air pollutant known to have many harmful effects.
