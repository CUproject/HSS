## Mineral industry of Europe
In 2012, an estimated 7 million people were employed in the mining industry, most of them in coal and lignite mining. Profits. Domestic mine production of industrial metals (excluding coal) was valued approximately $11 billion in 2018 compared with $10 billion in 2007 and $9.2 billion in 2006; the real producer's price index for industrial minerals in Germany increased about 3% in 2008
