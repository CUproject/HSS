## Electric Arc Furnace - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are a central part of the production route that is an alternative to the dominant BF-BOF route. EAFs are used to produce carbon steels and alloy steels primarily by recycling ferrous scrap. In an EAF scrap and/or manufactured iron units - such as DRI, pig iron, iron carbide - is melted and converted into high quality steel by using high-power electric arcs

Direct reduced iron (DRI) is a high-quality metal product obtained from iron ore and it is used as raw material in electric arc furnaces, blast furnaces, and in other more recent steelmaking processes [2]. 2. Total DRI Output in the World With the output of approx. 43.2 mil. tones in 2000 DRI accounts for 3 - 4 % of the total world ironmaking
