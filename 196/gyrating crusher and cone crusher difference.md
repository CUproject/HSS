## gyrating crusher and cone crusher difference
Nov 2, 2021The crushers are usually designated by the diameter, in feet or millimetres, of the head. The significant difference from the gyratory crusher is that the crushing chamber is now also in the form of an upright, truncated cone and the 'gyrating' cone, having an angle of about 45 ~ is supported entirely from beneath by the eccentric bush assembly.

Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.

For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.
