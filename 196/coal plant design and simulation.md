## Simulation For The Design Of Ball Mills For Coal Grinding
Our coal mill offers the flexibility of non-inert and inert operation, depending on the exploding potential of your coal type. The tailored layout considers your coal grinding needs, ensuring simple and optimised operation. For example, the availability of heat sources to dry raw coal helps determine the final layout.

## Dynamic modelling and simulation of a post-combustion CO2 capture 
Jul 2, 2021Solvent-based post-combustion capture technologies have great potential for CO2 mitigation in traditional coal-fired power plants. Modelling and simulation provide a low-cost opportunity to evaluate performances and guide flexible operation. Composed by a series of partial differential equations, first-principle post-combustion capture models are computationally expensive, which limits their
