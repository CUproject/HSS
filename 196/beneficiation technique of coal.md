## Thermo-adhesive Separation: a Novel Dry Coal Beneficiation Technique 
Jan 6, 2022Water is the mainstay for beneficiation of fine size coal and minerals; however, it is also the least desirable constituent in the final product. The basic concept of the novel process described in this paper is based on the differential surface heat conduction/absorption capacity of individual particles, which differs for different species of minerals. When a mixture of fine material is

Oct 5, 2020The dry separation methods for coal beneficiation have been regaining attention in the past decades. A number of improved or newly designed devices have been developed—one of them is a negative pressure pneumatic separator (NPPS). The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.

##  Mineral Comminution and Separation Systems - EOLSS
Beneficiation of coal is called 'coal preparation' in the broader sense or 'coal cleaning' in the narrower sense of the term. In the traditional convention, the term 'coal preparation' is common, and 'coal cleaning' is used to specify the techniques to separate the part richer in pure coal constituent in the

## Coal Beneficiation Process Diagram - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The report states that a 1% reduction in ash content of coal means a reduction of 30 cents in cost of pig iron. One large plant reduces the ash from 7% to 3.5% by cleaning, thus cutting the cost of producing pig iron a dollar or more per ton.
