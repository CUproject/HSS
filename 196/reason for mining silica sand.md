## Suddenly, silica sand is a big deal - and there are several very good 
Feb 9, 2021Silica sand is one of the most mined commodities in the world thanks to its angular particles that are capable of interlocking and providing greater load bearing capacity, which makes it valuable for land reclamation and the manufacture of concrete. Higher purity sands are also used for a wide range of applications in the foundry and glass

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Can sand mining ever be green? - Mining Technology
Sand mining can severely damage environments and ecosystems. Often mined by dredging sea and river beds, the practise poses a threat to biodiversity as creatures and plants are stripped from the depths, and the stirred up plumes suffocate fish and block sunlight from the remaining underwater vegetation. Along riverbanks, mining has changed the
