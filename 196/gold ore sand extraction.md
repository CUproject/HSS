## Roasting and Refractory Gold Ore - Manhattan Gold & Silver
Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception. During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

If surveyed correctly, a good gold mine would yield close to 6.5 g of gold for every 1000 kg of ore. Think about that. Gold ore is not pure, but instead intertwined with other metals like silver. In the mill, the large chunks of ore are crushed and broken down until it is a powdery sand-like mixture of gold, silver, and rock.
