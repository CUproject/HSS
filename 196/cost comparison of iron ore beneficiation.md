## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.
