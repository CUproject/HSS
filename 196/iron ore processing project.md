## Iron Ore Project Details - Macarthur Minerals
The Iron Ore Projects are situated in the Yilgarn Region of south-western, Western Australia. The Yilgarn Region is a host to many significant mineral deposits that have been or are being mined for iron ore. The tenements cover the Yeriligee greenstone belt which is some 80 km in length and lies within the Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn.

Which of the following is a process of beneficiation? In the case of a lower-grade iron ore, the beneficiation process includes activities such as crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening and silica froth flotation. These activities will help improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.
