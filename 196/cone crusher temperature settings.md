## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

An example of the effect that crusher setting has on the product gradation is as follows: If the target crusher setting is 3/8 in. (10 mm) but the setting is not checked and it wears open to 1/2 in. (13 mm), then the end result is a 15 percent decrease in the minus 3/8-in. (10 mm) material size. This is a substantial decrease in productivity.
