## What do in the aggregate and any one claim mean? | PolicyBee
Any one claim. PB: An any one claim policy also has a ceiling, albeit one decorated slightly differently. Using that example above, the same £250,000 level of cover will pay out a maximum of £250,000 for each claim, plus another £250,000 for each claim's legal costs. You might hear this described as an 'each and every claim' policy.
