## Plastic viscosity of cement mortar with manufactured sand as influenced 
Sep 1, 2021However, manufactured sand was found to cause poorer workability in mortar or concrete [,, ]. Westerholm et al. measured the rheology of mortar mixtures with various MS and found that the plastic viscosity of mortar increased almost three times as MS became increasingly elongated, which was attributed to the increased particle interference

## Is manufactured sand the material of the future? - Quarrying Africa
Aug 23, 2022Manufactured sand generally has higher compressive and flexural strength than natural sand. Due to weathering, natural sand particles are rounded, whereas manufactured sand particles are angular and have a rougher surface texture, allowing better bonding with the mortar in concrete, thereby providing improved strength properties.
