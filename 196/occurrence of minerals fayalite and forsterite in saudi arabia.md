## occurrence of minerals fayalite and forsterite in saudi
Geologic occurrence. Forsterite rich olivine is the most abundant mineral in the mantle above a depth of about 400 km ; pyroxenes are also important minerals in this upper part of the mantle. Forsterite also occurs in dolomitic marble which results from the metamorphism of high magnesium limestones and dolostones.

## Fayalite: Properties and Occurrence - Msrblog
Fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4), also called iron chrysolite, is the iron-rich end-member of the olivine solid-solution series. It is a black or brown mineral which is an iron-rich form of olivine and occurs in many igneous rocks. The name fayalite is derived from Faial (Fayal) Island in the Azores where it was first described in 1840.
