The Hamersley province of northwest Western Australia is one of the world's premier iron ore regions. The high-grade iron ore deposits are mostly hosted within banded iron formation (BIF) sequences of the Brockman and Marra Mamba Iron Formations of the Hamersley Group and consist of two types: martite-microplaty hematite containing between 60 and 68 wt percent Fe, and martite-goethite

About Banded iron formation Hide. Commonly termed BIFs by geologists, they are iron-rich rocks almost always of Precambrian age, predominantly associated with the great oxygenation event (GOE) about 2.3-2.8 billion years ago. It typically consists of repeated, thin iron oxide layers (a few mm to a few cm in thickness) but may be banded from a

Banded Iron Formation. Banded iron formations (BIF) are metamorphosed sedimentary rocks composed predominantly of thinly bedded iron minerals and silica (as quartz). The iron mineral present may be the carbonate siderite, but those used as iron ores contain the oxides magnetite or hematite. Banded Iron formations are known as taconite within

## Banded Iron Formations BIF - Geology In
Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age. A typical BIF consists of repeated, thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides, either magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3), alternating with bands of iron-poor shales and cherts

## Gold-rich banded iron formations - Ahead of the Herd
While most banded iron formations are composed of at least 15% iron (Fe), some BIFs are associated with non-Fe resources, including gold deposits in greenstone terranes - fragments of crust broken off from tectonic plates. Research suggests that black shales found in banded iron formations played a role in the creation of gold deposits.

## Banded iron formation
Banded iron formations are almost exclusively Precambrian in age, with most deposits dating to the late Archean ( Ma) with a secondary peak of deposition in the Orosirian period of the Paleoproterozoic (1850 Ma). Minor amounts were deposited in the early Archean and in the Neoproterozoic (750 Ma). The youngest known banded iron formation is an Early Cambrian formation in western China.
