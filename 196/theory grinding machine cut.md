A surface Grinding Machine is a machine in which a grinding wheel is used as a cutting tool for removing the material from the surface of the workpiece. It is also called an abrasive machining process where abrasives are placed on the surface and corners of the grinding wheel so as to do the finishing process with much more accuracy.
