To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

## Understanding the Difference Between Silica Sand and Washed Sand
Silica sand consists of fine pieces of quartz and other minerals such as salt, silt, clay, dust and various powders. Washed sand goes through a cleaning or "washing" process that removes these additional substances. MS Industries is a provider of naturally occurring smaller sized silica sand with microproppants and proppants.
