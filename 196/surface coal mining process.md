## Surface Mining - Coal Leader
Surface Mining. Once known as "strip" mining, this method of mining involves removing the overburden with heavy earth moving equipment, scooping out the coal, replacing the excavated soil and reestablishing vegetation and plant life, a process known as reclamation. As a method of coal extraction, surface mining accounts for about 60% of total U

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
Surface mining is used when the coal seam is near the surface. It recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited - 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.  Coal mining is only a temporary use of land, so it is vital that mine rehabilitation takes place once operations have stopped

## Surface mining
Surface mining, including strip mining, open-pit mining and mountaintop removal mining, is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed, in contrast to underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left in place, and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.. In North America, where the majority of surface coal mining

## Coal Mining and Processing Methods - The National Academies Press
In surface mining, the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction. The elements of a surface mining operation are (1) topsoil removal and storage for later use, (2) drilling and blasting the strata overlying the coal seam, (3) loading and transporting this fragmented overburden material (called spoil), (4) drilling and blasting the

An evaluation of mining and reclamation practices at 159 randomly sampled surface coal mines in the United States was conducted. Operating procedures for dragline stripping of single and multiple seams, surface mining of lignite, multicut and multiseam haulback mining on steep slopes, mountaintop removal, and surface mining in swampy or deeply glaciated areas are discussed.

## Lithium mining vs fossil fuelsofy
The common environmental side effects of lithium mining are water loss, ground destabilisation, biodiversity loss, increased salinity of rivers, contaminated soil and toxic waste. In the Salar de Uyuni, water loss is the main cause for concern. After the brine is pumped out from underneath the salt flat, it is left to evaporate through a series.

Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

Jan 25, 2022Underground mining, also known as deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surface—sometimes as far as 300 meters or more. Miners take an elevator going down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine, and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above ground.
