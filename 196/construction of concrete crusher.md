## Crushed Concrete Aggregate| Concrete Construction Magazine
When landfills located near populated areas started refusing broken concrete in the 1970s, the construction industry started crushing it to make aggregate for use as compactible fill. Wood and steel reinforcement were separated out, leaving aggregate that often included a mixture of concrete, brick, and asphalt, along with some dirt.

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
Crushed concrete became a more and more popular material choice for both roadways and driveway construction. Crushed concrete continued to grow in popularity into the 1980s along with recycling efforts.  The first step to recycling old concrete is to use industrial crushing equipment in order to break up the original structure. Next, the

Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.
