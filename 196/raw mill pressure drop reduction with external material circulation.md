## DESIGNING A PROCESS LINE | Dairy Processing Handbook
For a flow rate of 20 000 litres/hour and a pipe size of 2.5" (63.5 mm), a velocity of 1.75 m/s, the graph indicates a pressure drop, or loss of head, of 0.4 metre over the fully open valve. The pressure drop over each of the components in the line for a given flow rate can be determined in the same way.

## Hammer Mill vs. High Pressure Homogenizer for Particle Size Reduction
A hammer mill is a machine designed to crush material into smaller pieces by way of repeated blows from small hammers. Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush, grind, shatter or pulverize upon impact. Material is fed into the mill grinding chamber through the feed chute. The material is repeatedly struck by hammers

## Operational parameters affecting the vertical roller mill performance 
Finally, the power consumption of the VRM unit compared with 14 raw mill units around Iran and the international best available technology (IBAT). The results demonstrated that the VRM unit consumes around 81% (9.75 kWh/t of raw materials), and 36% (5.8 kWh/t of raw materials) more energy to grind raw material than the IBAT unit and domestic

External circulation: ¢ The material is lifted up over the louvre ring by the gas flow and pneumatically recirculated. To lift up the larger particles, too much gas velocity is needed which causes high pressure loss across the louvre ring.

## Ball Mill Circulating Load - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The circulating loads generated in a typical ball mill cyclone circuit contain a small fraction of bypassed fines. The concept that high circulating loads will result in overgrinding can be refuted by regarding increases in circulating load in the same vein as multistage grinding. That is, for every incremental increase in circulating load of
