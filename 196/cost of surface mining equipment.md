## mining - Surface mining | Britannica
Surface mining. It has been estimated that more than two-thirds of the world's yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining. There are several types of surface mining, but the three most common are open-pit mining, strip mining, and quarrying. These differ from one another in the mine geometries created, the techniques used, and

Manufacturers' costs are increasing, and they are understood to be passing this increase along in higher prices.  Thus Parker Bay's Surface Mining Equipment Index (value-weight with Q1 2007 = 100) rose to 68.4, the highest since Q3 2019. In contrast, unit deliveries increased by 12.9% YoY while value of shipments were higher by just 7.6%

## Types of Surface Mining | American Mine Services
In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

## Which Of These Is A Benefit Of Surface Mining
Surface mines offer advantages and disadvantages when compared to underground mining. Amongst the advantages are that it is cheaper, can recover more of the resource (usually up to 100% within the mining excavation), is safer and can use larger-scale mining equipment offering higher production rates.
