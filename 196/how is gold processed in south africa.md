## How is gold processed after mining? - Profound-Answers
Gold is processed by cyanide milling, a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore. It is then refined to the gold standard purity, according to Mineweb. Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction, but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.
