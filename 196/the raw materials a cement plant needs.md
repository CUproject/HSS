It is worth noting that cement and aggregates are manufactured or obtained from natural solid stone, which is quarried, crushed, screened and processed to give the required physical and chemical properties.

## Cement Industry: QA of Raw Materials Process Testing
Mar 31, 2021All cement-producing facilities should be carrying out small-scale tests on a routine basis or even pilot plant production. Tests often take place in laboratories at temperatures from ambient up to 1600Â°C. CARBOLITE GERO manufactures a range of lab and industrial products suitable for use at ambient to 3000Â°C and these products are suitable
