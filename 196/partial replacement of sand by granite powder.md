Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

They observed that granite dust replacement up to 15% showed better strength results without adverse durability effects. Ghanam et al. suggested partial replacement of sand with the mixture of iron dust and granite powder. It is found that replacement of natural sand up to 10% enhanced the strength properties of concrete.

The outcomes of the experimental works improved that using porcelain aggregate as a partial replacement had an advanced effect on the compressive strength for all the adopted percentages and for all the studied curing ages. The maximum modification that's obtained in case of porcelain aggregate was (24.14) % at age (90) days for 20% replacement.
