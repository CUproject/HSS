## The impact of short-term variability of deposits for iron ore processing
At Iron Ore 2017, a common concern across the industry was managing the short-term variability of ore characteristics within deposits in iron ore processing, the flow-on effects of unplanned processing issues, and the resulting downtime across the production cycle. Unlike long-term trends, these incidents are less predictable and require swift

## Iron Ore Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being
