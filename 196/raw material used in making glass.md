Raw Materials . To the core, pencils still use graphite that is called lead by the common people. It is combined with wax or clay depending on the type of pencil that is being manufactured. Special wood called the cedar wood is used to make the outer part of the pencil so that it can easily withstand the sharpening of the pencil.

## How Glass is Made — SGS
The main raw material used to make glass is sand. To make clear glass, a special sand called silica sand is used. This fine white sand is needed because it is very pure and does not contain other unwanted chemicals. It is "washed" to remove as many impurities as possible, as impurities can adversely affect the clarity and color of the glass.

Abstract. Approximately three millions of tonnes of glass are produced each year in the United Kingdom, 21 million tonnes in the European Union altogether, of which approximately 66% is made as containers and 22% produced as flat or window glass. The USA produces approximately 15 million tonnes of glass annually and Japan 13 million tonnes.

Batch processing is one of the initial steps of the glass-making process. The batch house simply houses the raw materials in large silos (fed by truck or railcar) and holds anywhere from 1-5 days of material. Some batch systems include material processing such as raw material screening/sieve, drying, or pre-heating (i.e. cullet). Whether

## What Raw Materials Are Used in Glass Making?
There are four main raw materials used to make glass: silica sand, soda ash, dolomite and limestone. In many cases, broken pieces of glass called cullet are also added to these raw materials to help them properly melt when heated. There are a number of different ways to make glass, depending on the desired finished product.

Glass recycling uses sand in greater volumes than cullet. These materials are mixed, heated to a temperature of 2600 to 2800 degrees Fahrenheit and then molded into the desired shape. Recycled glass can be substituted for up to 95% of raw materials. Recycled glass saves energy, decreases the consumption of raw materials, and reduces emissions.

## Properties of Glass Materials Guide | Swift Glass
Properties of Glass Materials. In general, glass is a hard and brittle substance that is usually transparent or translucent. It may be comprised of a fusion of sand, soda, lime, or other materials. The most common glass forming process heats the raw materials until they become molten liquid, then rapidly cools the material to create hardened glass.

## Different kinds of watch materials and glass characteristics
A ceramic watch is very scratch and heat resistant. The material does however succumb quite quickly when it is teared. That is why ceramic is often combined with a tougher material, like stainless steel. The best characteristics of both materials are combined in a ceramic watch. The hardness of the ceramic can be compared to the scratch
