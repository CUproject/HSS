## Pressure Filters - Evoqua
Pressure Filters Reduce the number of suspended solids in the feedwater by filtering water through a multi-layered filter bed  Multimedia filtration is a water treatment process that uses multiple layers of filtration media to provide a higher sediment holding capacity as compared to conventional single and dual media sand filters.

## Tertiary Wastewater Treatment, Pressure Filters, Ozone Generators 
Tertiary treatment technologies can be extensions of the biological treatment process to further stabilize oxygen-demanding substances in wastewater, or to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. Ecologix offers an extensive catalog of tertiary treatment technologies, including carbon adsorption, flocculation, membrane filtration, and pressure filtration.

Sand filter. Sand filter is one of the oldest and most common methods of water treatment that is used to remove suspended particles in the water with a size of more than 100 microns. Cheap price, efficiency and long life are among the positive features that have made sand filter water treatment widely used in domestic and industrial applications.

## MultiMedia Filters | Industrial Wastewater Treatment | Oil Water Separators
Principal of Operation - MultiMedia Filters. MultiMedia filters are essentially particle separators . That is to say that any particle larger than the collective effect of the media particles will be separated from the water. Generally speaking, a properly designed MMF can remove 10 to 15 micron particles. Visible particles are ~40 microns.

About Pressure Filters. Pressure filters rely on a porous media to retain solids from high concentration slurries and use the feed pressure of the pump to "squeeze" the free water from the resulting sludge cake. The cloth retains the solids and the cake removes more and finer solids, resulting in a better, more efficient filter.

Water filter pitchers. Water filter pitchers are pitchers that are filled from the top and have built-in filters that water must pass through before being poured out for drinking or other use. Pros: Inexpensive to purchase, no installation, easy to use. Cons: Vary by model and pore size, filters must be replaced regularly, slow filtering.

## Horizontal Pressure Filter - inmartek
ADDITIONAL INFO. Horizontal Pressure Filters operate like other pressure filters although the horizontal configuration increases filtration area per footprint. Multiple cells can be installed in a single vessel to allow operating flexibility and backwashing from in-service cells. Over 1 MGD (4 MLD), they are more economical than several

## Drinking Water Filtration Using Granular Activated Carbon
Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) is commonly employed as an adsorption media in many surface water treatment plants. Most plants, however, also rely on GAC to provide effective filtration, as turbidity reduction is an essential element in maintaining desired water quality. Often used in conjunction with sand and gravel, GAC provides many
