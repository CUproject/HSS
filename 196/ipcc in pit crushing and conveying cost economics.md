## Lower costs with in-pit crushing and conveying
Comparing these two scenarios, using energy and labor costs typical in an Asian country, the in-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) solution would be around 20% or EUR .25/ton cheaper to operate, including the cost of the capital funded at an interest rate of 7% over seven years. In a country with higher costs of inputs, IPCC is even more cost

## In-pit crushing and conveying technology in open-pit mining operations 
ABSTRACT In-Pit Crushing and Conveying (IPCC) systems are receiving more attention today due to current characteristics of open-pit mining operations and what is expected to occur in the future. Today, it has become more necessary than ever to reduce the cost of truck haulage, which accounts for roughly half the operating costs of mining operation. Trucking costs can be significantly reduced
