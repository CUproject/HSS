Railways existed long before steam engines were invented. From the mid-1500s onward, railways were used in some European mines to move heavy wagonloads of coal and mineral ore along tunnels. Later, others were built to carry coal from collieries (coal mines) to ships in nearby rivers and harbors. The wagons ran first on parallel wooden planks

Coal is non-renewable. This means that one day we will run out of coal. Burning coal produces carbon dioxide gas. This is a greenhouse gas that contributes towards climate change. Burning coal pollutes the air. In fact, coal is the worst pollutant we have. Much of the coal we use in the UK must be imported, adding to its harm.

Coal facts. Coal is an organically derived material. It is formed from the remains of decayed plant material compacted into a solid through millions of years of chemical changes under pressure and heat. Its rich carbon content gives coal most of its energy content. When coal is burned in the presence of air or oxygen, heat energy is released.
