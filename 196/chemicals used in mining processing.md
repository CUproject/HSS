However, PFAS have long been used in mining, as part of both processing and firefighting activities. PFAS may be present due to the use of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) for firefighting, but also through inclusion in surfactants, ore-floating processes and other performance chemicals such as hydraulic fluids and fuel additives.

## Chemicals Used in Mining: Red Valve Pinch Valve Solution
Chemicals in the Mining Process. Many different types of chemicals can be found throughout the mining process, from naturally occurring acids brought up with ore, to chemicals introduced during processing to break down minerals and control pH levels. To reduce wear and ensure reliability, the valves used to control these chemicals and tailings
