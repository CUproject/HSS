The coal is loaded on to large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or direct to where it will be used. Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors.

## Coal fired power plant - Energy Education
Many coal plants are mine mouth which means the plant was put where the coal mine is, so the coal doesn't need to be transported by train. Once unloaded, the coal is then pulverized into a fine powder by a large grinder. This ensures nearly complete burning of the coal in order to maximize the heat given off and to minimize pollutants.

Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

Underground mining. In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface, and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities for such essential activities

## The number of producing U.S. coal mines fell in 2020
Jul 30, 2021Coal production in the Western region primarily comes from large surface mines in the Powder River Basin. Since 2008, the number of coal mines in the Western region has declined from 58 mines to 45 mines—only 1 of those 13 closures was in the Powder River Basin. So far in 2021, U.S. coal production has increased from 2020 levels.

## Coal | Uses, Types, Pollution, & Facts | Britannica
6 days agocoal, one of the most important primary fossil fuels, a solid carbon-rich material that is usually brown or black and most often occurs in stratified sedimentary deposits. Coal is defined as having more than 50 percent by weight (or 70 percent by volume) carbonaceous matter produced by the compaction and hardening of altered plant remains—namely, peat deposits.
