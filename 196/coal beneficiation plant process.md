Worldwide, almost 60% of total coal beneficiation is carried out by heavy media process. In India in 80% cases the heavy media used is magnetite. The paper essentially deals with the magnetite stability factors, its preparation and recovery processes, its operational uti-lization and the existing systems in some Indian coal washing plants.

Thus, three products are produced by this process. Clean coal is supplied to steel plants, the middlings to thermal power stations, and the rejects are usually dumped near the washery or utilized for power generation. Summing up, raw coal is usually crushed to 15 mm and then screened into three fractions 15-25 mm, 25-0.5 mm and - 0.5 mm.

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.
