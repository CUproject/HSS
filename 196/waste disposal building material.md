A construction waste-management plan should recognize project waste as an integral part of overall materials management. The premise is that waste management is a part of materials management, and the recognition that one project's wastes are materials available for another project facilitates efficient and effective waste management.

Building material salvage, reuse, and recycling for homeowners. Many building materials have the potential to be salvaged and reused or recycled. In fact, about 85 percent of the materials in a typical demolition project could be salvaged and kept out of landfills. But currently, only about 30 percent of building materials are reused or recycled.

Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.

What is Plasma Gasification. Plasma gasification is an environment-friendly waste disposal method. It is used to convert commodity recyclables extracted from the municipal solid waste in the landfill into energy. The carbon-based materials are exposed to high temperatures and converted to syngas, a gas that can either be directly combusted or further refined into chemicals and higher-grade fuels.
