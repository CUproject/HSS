## Manufacturing of Cement By Dry and Wet Process - Expert Civil
Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart. (i) Drying Zones: In the wet process, the drying zone is comparatively larger than the dry process. It is because the raw material in slurry form is directly fed into the kiln which has more amount of water. As shown in the figure it is the upper portion of the kiln.
