## Differences between underground mining and open pit mining
The Witwatersrand gold mine in South Africa is an excellent example of underground mining that exploits gold from ancient rocks at depths of up to 4 km underground. What is open pit mining. On the other hand, open-pit mining is the most common mining and ranges from very low-priced minerals to finely disseminated gold deposits.

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, [1] is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.

## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained | Anglo American
Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.

1.What is open pit mining？ Open pit mining is the process of removing the covering from the ore body to obtain the desired minerals. Open-pit mining can be divided into open-pit metal deposit mining, open-pit coal mining, and open-pit iron mining.The former mainly mines non-ferrous metals, the middle mainly mines coal and some non-metallic ores, and the latter mainly mines iron ore.

An open-pit mine is structured in steps, often also termed "benches," which are the pit's vertical levels. These steps commonly range from four to sixty meters, but the size is largely dependent upon the machinery used by the mining company. The walls of the pit are called the batter, while the flat portion is called the berm or the bench.
