## What is Lime: Lime vs Limestone - Mintek Resources
What is the Difference Between Lime and Limestone? Lime is a versatile chemical with many uses. It is vital in the production of countless materials. Lime, or calcium oxide (CaO), is derived from high quality natural deposits of limestone, or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Limestone is a sedimentary rock that formed millions of years ago as the
