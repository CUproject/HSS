## concentration or dressing of ore
May 23, 2022Apr 10, 2017 Ore-dressing methods fall naturally into two general subdivisions— (1) concentration methods and (2) direct-recovery methods (amalgamation and leaching or wet methods). Concentration methods are employed to remove worthless gangue material and concentrate the valuable minerals of the crude ore in a smaller bulk.

The ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand, clay, lime stone, etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores. The choice of method depends on the nature of the ore.
