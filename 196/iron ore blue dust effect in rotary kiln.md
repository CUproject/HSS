## Experimental Studies on Reduction of Coarse Blue Dust for  - IJERT
Blue dust was also used in Iron ore sintering as a sweetener [7].  Effect of temperature on degree of reduction was studied between 700oC, 800oC and 900oC at 5 hours and 6 hours reduction time. A graph was plotted as shown in the fig. 4. In both the cases (5 hours and 6 hours) as the temperature increased the degree of reduction increased.
