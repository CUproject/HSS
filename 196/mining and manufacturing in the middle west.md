During the Middle Ages between the 5th and 16th century AD, Western Europe saw a period of growth in the mining industry. The first important mines were those at Goslar in the Harz mountains, taken into commission in the 10th century. Another famous mining town is Falun in Sweden where copper has been mined since at least the 10th century and possibly even earlier.

## Medieval Occupations and Jobs: Miner. History of Miners and Activities
In the early Middle Ages mining was mainly focused on the extraction of iron and copper, although other metals were also used for gilding and coinage. Initially, the majority of the metals were extracted from shallow depths using open-pit mining. During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline.
