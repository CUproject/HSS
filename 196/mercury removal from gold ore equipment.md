## Mercury Removal From Gold Cyanide Leach Solution | SpringerLink
The Bureau of Mines investigated selective extraction of Au and Ag from a low-grade Au ore containing Hg. Gold and silver were extracted from the ore in cyanide slurries, and Hg extraction was suppressed with sodium or calcium sulfide. Maximum Au extraction and minimum Hg extraction were obtained using solutions containing 17 kg NaCN/t of solution (0.34 lb NaCN/st). Increasing the cyanide

## Gravity Concentration in Artisanal Gold Mining - MDPI
Worldwide there are over 43 million artisanal miners in virtually all developing countries extracting at least 30 different minerals. Gold, due to its increasing value, is the main mineral extracted by at least half of these miners. The large majority use amalgamation either as the final process to extract gold from gravity concentrates or from the whole ore.

## Remove Mercury during Gold Leaching - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
How to Remove Mercury from Gold Cyanide Leach Solution During the past few years, several low-grade Au ore deposits containing Hg have been developed and are being processed by cyanidation to recover precious metals. These ores usually have less than 15 ppm Hg content. During cyanidation, 10 to 30 pct of the Hg is extracted along with Au and Ag.

## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury
