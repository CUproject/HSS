## How Are Mineral Resources Distributed Among The Countries Of East Asia?
Natural and mineral resources are unevenly distributed throughout East Asia. .Because of the number of mountains in East Asia, the amount of land available for agriculture is limited, so China's population is concentrated in the east where river and basins are located.

Mercury is a metal that can be extracted from its ore cinnabar in a combined form of HgS. These are the steps included in the extraction of mercury: Roasting: The first step is the oxidation of mercury in the presence of oxygen inside the ore. Extraction: Since, it has a low boiling point; it can easily be extracted via vacuum distillation.

Vanadium is extracted from carnotite as a coproduct with uranium by leaching the ore concentrate for 24 hours with hot sulfuric acid and an oxidant such as sodium chlorate. After removal of solids, the leachate is fed into a solvent extraction circuit where the uranium is extracted in an organic solvent consisting of 2.5-percent-amine-2.5

## Vanadium
Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery-grey, malleable transition metal.The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer (passivation) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation.. Spanish scientist Andrés Manuel del Río discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801

Ore: A mineral from which metals can be extracted profitably is called a metal ore. Profitable extraction means that the cost of getting the metal out of the ore is sufficiently less than the amount of money made by selling the metal. So All Ores Are Minerals But All Minerals Are Not Ores. The most common metal ores are oxides and sulphides.
