## Magma (Characteristics, Types, Sources, and Evolution) - Geology In
Magma (Characteristics, Types, Sources, and Evolution) A magma consists mostly of liquid rock matter, but may contain crystals of various minerals, and may contain a gas phase that may be dissolved in the liquid or may be present as a separate gas phase. Magma can cool to form an igneous rock either on the surface of the Earth - in which case

## Igneous Rocks - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)
Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for "fire") form when hot, molten rock (magma) crystallizes and solidifies. Magma originates deep within the Earth, near active plate boundaries or hot spots. Magma that rises to the surface is called lava. Igneous rocks are classified into two groups depending upon where the molten rock solidifies: Extrusive

## Using Volcanic Rock Dust in Your Garden | Organic Soil & Compost
The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.

Volcanic rock dust has long been used by organic and sustainable farmers to promote soil health and to grow nutrient dense crops in a variety of conditions. Not all rock dust is alike, however. Created through the cooling and solidification of dense viscous lava, volcanic basalt is an igneous rock that underlies much of the Earth's oceans.

## Difference Between Basalt and Granite
Granite is an igneous plutonic rock which is very common in continental crust. It forms from subterranean magma chambers that cool and harden beneath the surface and then become exhumed and exposed at the surface. Basalt and granite are similar in the they are both igneous, silicate rocks and common on Earth. They also have numerous differences.

## Igneous Rocks: Everything You Need to Know - ThoughtCo
The two best-known igneous rock types are basalt and granite, which have distinctly different compositions and textures. Basalt is the dark, fine-grained stuff of many lava flows and magma intrusions. Its dark minerals are rich in magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe), hence basalt is called a "mafic" rock.

Some of the igneous rocks examples are gabbro, granite, peridotite, and diorite. Next, there are the extrusive igneous rocks that do not allow crystallization to form. Thus, this produces fine-grained, vesicular and glassy rocks. For instance, basalt, rhyolite, and andesite are all extrusive igneous rocks examples.

igneous rock, any of various crystalline or glassy rocks formed by the cooling and solidification of molten earth material. Igneous rocks constitute one of the three principal classes of rocks, the others being metamorphic and sedimentary. Igneous rocks are formed from the solidification of magma, which is a hot (600 to 1,300 °C, or 1,100 to 2,400 °F) molten or partially molten rock material.
