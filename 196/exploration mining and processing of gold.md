## GOLD MINING AND PROCESSING - World Trade Minerals Incorporation
Stages of Gold Mining. Before gold is mined, we first carryout a significant exploration and development to determine the size of the gold deposit in a particular gold mine. The process or lifecycle of gold mine starts with exploration (1-10 years), development (this takes about 1 to 5 years), operation (10-30 years), decommissioning (1-5years

## Buy Gold: Gold Exploration & Mining - Gold Price
Gold exploration and mining is something that every gold investor should be familiar with.  With the price of gold 10 years ago, lower grams of gold ore would not have been viable due to the cost of mining and processing. These days, as the price of gold continues to rise, mines containing a lower amount of gold per tone of ore become more

Early Gold Finds and Production. Gold was produced in the southern Appalachian region as early as 1792 and perhaps as early as 1775 in southern California. The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in California sparked the gold rush of, and hundreds of mining camps sprang to life as new deposits were discovered.

## Environmental Impacts of Gold Mining - Earthworks
The solution strips away the gold and is collected in a pond, then run through an electro-chemical process to extract the gold. This method of producing gold is cost effective but enormously wasteful: 99.99 percent of the heap becomes waste. Gold mining areas are frequently studded with these immense, toxic piles.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.
