## Coal Washing Process - JXSC Mineral
The coal beneficiation or coal preparation process separates inorganic impurities from raw mined coal, reducing the concentration of unwanted material or gangue and thereby providing improved combustion characteristics to the fuel produced. The commonly used beneficiation methods for coal sorting and processing include jig separation, heavy medium, and flotation.

## How acetylene is made - material, making, used, processing, Raw Materials
For commercial purposes, acetylene can be made from several different raw materials depending on the process used. The simplest process reacts calcium carbide with water to produce acetylene gas and a calcium carbonate slurry, called hydrated lime. The chemical reaction may be written as CaC 2 + 2 H 2 O → C 2 H 2 + Ca (OH) 2 .
