## How does the density of the rock compare to the density of the water 
The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity, which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water. This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g/cm3. Therefore, these numbers translate directly to g/cm3, or tonnes per cubic meter (t/m3).

Grain density describes the density of solid or mineral grains of the rock.. Grain density can give an indication of the mineralogy of the rock: Dolomite, ρ = 2.8-3.1 g/cm 3 Shales, ρ = 2.65-2.8 g/cm 3 Shales are composed of several minerals that have different densities in different relative amounts.

## Rockwool Thickness & Density for Soundproofing  - Sound Proof Anything
May 16, 2022Using higher-density rockwool will help absorb more sound, but doubling the density only yields about a 20-100% increase in sound absorption depending on the frequency, with the maximum increase in absorption being in the 250Hz range. The best density for absorbing the widest range of frequencies possible seems to be between 70- and 94kg/m3.

## What is the density of a rock in water? - Profound-Answers
What is the effect of density on rocks? This explains the general rule of density variation: Igneous rocks show an increase of density from felsic (acid) to mafic (basic) types; Porous rocks show a density decrease with increasing porosity and decreasing water saturation. This is demonstrated more in detail by Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4, Figure 4.5.

## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals - ThoughtCo
Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities. This is partly due to different rocks of the same type containing different proportions of minerals. Granite, for example, can have a quartz content anywhere between 20% and 60%.

## Density of Solid Worlds - Montana State University
Following are some notes which are included to help you carry out this investigation: Method: assume the world is only made of two things (metal & rock -or- rock & ice). Then: D_world = D1F1 + D2F2. Where D1= density of material 1, F1 = volume fraction of world made of material 1. F1 + F2 = 1 (or 100%) Algebra: D_world = D1F1 + D2 (1-F1)

## SECTION 4: DENSITY OF ROCKS | Handbook of Physical Constants 
REFERENCES FOR TABLE 4-2. 1. George, Jour. Geology, 32, 353, 1924 2. Tilley, Min. Mag., 19, 275, 1922 Table 4-1 was taken by Daly from a slightly longer compilation in his Igneous rocks and the depths of the earth (New York, McGraw-Hill Book Co., 598 p., 1933). It is virtually the same as the list in the first edition of the Handbook of Physical Constants, but with more extensive data for dunites.
