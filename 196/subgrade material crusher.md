From the test results it is identified that crusher dust - sand mixes attained high densities, high CBR values (>10%) and shear strength values (φ >36).Hence, it is concluded that 30-40% addition of sand to crusher dust yields satisfactory results and can be used as sub-grade and fill materials in various geotechnical construction activities.

## Subbase or Subgrade: Improving Soil Conditions - The Balance Small Business
When the subgrade material is not adequate to support the necessary loads, then additional work should be done to make the material suitable for the construction. Normally, subgrade material is improved by installing geotextiles. They are used to prevent mixing of soft or inadequate soil that might affect the structural capacity of the subgrade.

5.Ease of compaction: Sub grade soils must have good compacting properties. A well-compacted subgrade surface increases the strength and durability of road pavements. Due to ease of compaction ensures high density and strength. Sub grade soils must have resistance to weathering therefore retain the desired support.

## Modulus of Subgrade Reaction - Pavement Interactive
The modulus of subgrade reaction (k) is used as a primary input for rigid pavement design. It estimates the support of the layers below a rigid pavement surface course (the PCC slab). The k-value can be determined by field tests or by correlation with other tests. There is no direct laboratory procedure for determining k-value.

In transportation engineering, the subgrade is the basic material for nstruction road, pavement, or railway track. The term may also refer to imported material that has been used to build an embankment. Subgrade performance depends on these basic characteristics: Load-bearing capacity. Moisture ntent. Stabilization with cement or asphaltic binder.

## Granular Sub Base Construction and Quality Control
Granular Sub Base (GSB) is a natural or designed construction material used as a sub-base layer for road construction. Granular Sub Base is a layer in the road foundation just above the compacted sub-grade layer. GSB or granular sub base prevents capillary water from rising; its particle size is so designed that the capillary action stops and
