## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the Products in Between)
An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.

## Extraction process of Aluminium from it's Ore (bauxite)
Aluminium's ore is bauxite. Bauxite is an impure aluminium oxide. The major impurities include:iron oxides, silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. Aluminium is high in the reactivity series, thus it is impossible to extract it from its ore using carbon reduction, as the bonds in the aluminium oxide are very strong.

## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
Aug 12, 2022The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

## The United States is reliant upon imports for nearly all of the
Metallurgical-grade bauxite (crude dry) imports in 2012 totaled 10.3 Mt (11.3 million st), 8 percent more than the quantity imported in 2011. In the bauxite refining process, the aluminum-bearing minerals in bauxite are converted in a multiple-step process to alumina (Al2O3). Alumina can be smelted to form metallic aluminum or it can be used as
