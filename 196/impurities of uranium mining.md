Uranium mining can contaminate air, water, and soil. The chemical toxicity of the metal constitutes the primary environmental health hazard, with the radioactivity of uranium a secondary concern. The update of the toxicologic evidence on uranium adds to the established findings regarding nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity, and developmental defects.

## Uranium Mining Overview - World Nuclear Association
Uranium Mining Overview. (Updated June 2022) In the last 60 years uranium has become one of the world's most important energy minerals. It is mined and concentrated similarly to many other metals. While uranium is used almost entirely for making electricity, a small proportion is used for the important task of producing medical isotopes.

## Potential Human Health Effects of Uranium Mining, Processing, and 
Uranium mining and processing are associated with a wide range of potential adverse human health risks. Some of these risks arise out of aspects of uranium mining and processing specific to that enterprise, whereas other risks apply to the mining sector generally and still others are linked more broadly to large-scale industrial or construction activities.

## The Toxic Legacy of Uranium Mining on Navajo Land: The  - Water
Uranium Mining Exposure Mechanisms and Environmental Costs. Until the 1970s, uranium was primarily acquired through open-air pits. Mining companies would extract rocks containing uranium from the ground and then crush them into a powdered dust. Thereafter, a liquid solution separated the uranium from the other matter in the rock.

## Uranium Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
William L. Chenoweth, Thomas C. Pool, in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology (Third Edition), 2003 IV.B Mining. Uranium ore is mined using open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other minerals and coal. In situ leaching of permeable sandstone deposits accounts for an increasing share of production. The depth, grade, and size of the deposit determines the
