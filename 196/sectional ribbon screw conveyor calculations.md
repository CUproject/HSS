## Ribbon Mixer Advantages & Selection | Screw Conveyor Bega
Typically you will find that screw ribbon mixer vendors assign their mixer models by container volume capacities. Note that the volume of the container does not refer to the total weight of the product but to obtain this value you will have to know the bulk density of your product and multiply it by the volume of the container.

KWS designs and manufactures two types of ribbon flighting - integral leg and post type. Integral leg ribbon flights are manufactured using the same process as sectional flights and the leg is integral with the ribbon. Post type ribbon flights use round bar posts that are typically located every 90 to 120-degrees around the diameter of the pipe.
