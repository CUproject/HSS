## An Introduction To Surface Mining
An Introduction To Surface Mining. Mining is merely defined as digging in the ground to find something of use. The process has been a part of life since antiquity, and is still the backbone of the world's commerce and production. Mining could be classified in two forms: mining at the earth's surface (surface mining) and mining underground

## What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Surface Mining?
Advantages of surface mining include economic and financial benefits for miners and communities and a safer alternative to pit mining, but its disadvantages include environmental impacts, such as erosion and contamination. Surface mining, also called strip mining, delivers economically vital supplies of coal, which powers transportation and creates consumer products, boosting local economies

## Blasting injuries in surface mining with emphasis on flyrock and blast 
The hazards of surface blasting are primarily due to lack of blast area security, flyrock, premature blast, and misfire. Blasting generally entails two purposes: rock fragmentation and displacement of the broken rock. The displacement of the broken rock depends on the shot-design parameters, geological conditions, and mining constraints.

Underground mining. Underground or "deep" mining consist mostly of two methods - room-and-pillar and longwall mining.

Underground mining Sub-surface mining (underground mining) is the way to go when the open pit mining operation becomes far too expensive.

The U.S. coal economy underwent significant changes during the late twentieth century in terms of where and how coal was produced. Overall production increased after 1960 in eastern coal mines, with another jump occurring in western mines after 1970. Mining techniques also shifted from underground to surface mining.

In surface mining activities it is generally possible to remove all of the re-sizzles provided the miner of course is willing to dig a deep enough hole. The selection of a mining method doesn't have to be exclusive; sometimes it's most economical to mine a deposit using a combination of underground and surface mining techniques.
