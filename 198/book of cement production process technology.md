## cement | Definition, Composition, Manufacture, History, & Facts
Sep 17, 2022cement, in general, adhesive substances of all kinds, but, in a narrower sense, the binding materials used in building and civil engineering construction. Cements of this kind are finely ground powders that, when mixed with water, set to a hard mass. Setting and hardening result from hydration, which is a chemical combination of the cement compounds with water that yields submicroscopic

Methods of cement manufacturing 1- Wet process ___ grinding and mixing of the raw materials in the existence of water. 2- Dry process ___ grinding and mixing of the raw materials in their dry state. The process to be chosen, depend onthe nature of the used raw materials.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

There are four stages in the manufacture of portland cement: (1) crushing and grinding the raw materials, (2) blending the materials in the correct proportions, (3) burning the prepared mix in a kiln, and (4) grinding the burned product, known as " clinker," together with some 5 percent of gypsum (to control the time of set of the cement).

Cement is produced by mixing and fine-grinding clinker, gypsum and mineral components (e.g. limestone, pozzolana, fly ash or granulated blast furnace slag, silica fume) in cement mills. Gypsum is added to control cement setting, i.e. the hardening process. Mineral components are added to reduce the clinker portion in cements and introduce

Concrete Design & Production. Concrete is a mixture of two components: aggregates and paste. The paste, comprised of cement and water, binds the aggregates (usually sand and gravel or crushed stone) into a rocklike mass as the paste hardens.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
