What made South African mining viable was a new technique using cyanidation called the MacArthur Forrest process patented in 1887. By 1898 South African gold output had expanded to 118 tons (3.8 million oz), making it the world's leading producer, and after the interruption of the Boer War it soared to 280 tons (9 million oz) by 1913.

## South Africa: Days of Coal Mines Are Numbered as Eskom Shifts Focus 
While 93 coal mines produced all of South Africa's coal in 2016, that number increased 59%, to 148 mines, by 2016. Production, however, increased by only about 10%, indicative of a trend towards smaller mines. But with smaller mines and shorter lifespans, mining companies are targeting new areas for coal mining.

Old King Coal. Coal has long been king in South Africa: 92 per cent of electricity and 20 per cent of transport fuels come from coal. Approximately half of the 140 million tonnes of coal produced each year is exported (production is 142 million tonnes and exports are reported to be 73 million tonnes) predominantly to India, China, Korea and Japan.
