## S-160 D Mine Shaft Radio Communication System - INOVA
The mine shaft radio communication system is desgned for wireless transfer of verbal information between a hoisting machine operator or a cager working at the edge of the shaft and an operator of the mine-cage on any level within the shaft. Moreover, the system enables communication between the operators of the mine-cage and the shaft bottom.

## A Basic Introduction to Underground Mining
Aug 26, 2021August 26, 2021. Underground mining usually involves the digging of subversive tunnels and rooms below ground surface. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining and can be dangerous. This kind of mining is only used in areas where quality ore, such as gold, are concentrated in thin veins and other remarkably rich deposits.
