##  Nigeria's Solid Minerals as a Source of Economic Development
The vastness of Nigeria's minerals resources cannot and should not be over emphasised. We began to explore and exploit her natural mineral resources in 1902 and in its prime, the solid minerals sector was one of the largest producers of tin and coal, as well as a producer of a considerable 1.4 tons of gold annually.

## Nigeria's Industrial Structure - Weebly
Nigeria's Industrial Structure. This involves getting raw materials. For example, metals and coal have to be mined and foodstuffs farmed. This is the manufacturing process. It involves converting raw materials into products, for example, making plastics from oil. It also involves assembling the product, e.g. building houses, bridges and roads.

## Barite as an industrial mineral in Nigeria: occurrence, utilization 
Jun 1, 2021The mining industry in Nigeria is underdeveloped, resulting in the importation of minerals that could be produced domestically (Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, 2016). There are about 44 different types of minerals that have been identified in over 500 locations in Nigeria and one of such minerals is barite.

The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3% of its gross domestic product, due to the influence of its vast oil resources. The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped, leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically, such as salt or iron ore.Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria, which grants titles
