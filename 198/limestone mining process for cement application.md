## How To Mine Limestone - Realonomics
Feb 12, 2022How To Mine Limestone? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Limestone ( calcium carbonate, CaCOj) from mines or quarries is heated in a kiln (calcined). [Pg.23] To reduce soil acidity and keep cropland productive, farmers amend the soil by liming, which is the application of limestone. Limestone is calcium carbonate, and the carbonate anion is the conjugate base of hydrogen carbonate.
