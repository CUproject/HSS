## Benefit-cost analysis model of using class F fly ash-based green cement 
As a case in point, fly ash-based green cement may be a very good candidate for replacing cement in the making of masonry units (Sun, 2005). Nevertheless, the cost benefits of GC must be quantified. Therefore, a benefit-cost analysis should be considered for enhancing the use of fly ash-based green cement.
