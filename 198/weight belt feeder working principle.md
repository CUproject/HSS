## Belt filter press working principle and operation
Belt filter press working principle and operation. Posted: The belt filter press working principle and operation can be divided into four important stages: pretreatment, gravity dewatering, pre-pressure dewatering in the wedge zone and press dewatering. It is an environmentally friendly filtration product with reliable performance, stable work, low water content of finished products
