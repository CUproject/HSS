## Adding a solute to a solvent-expeerts
The integral equation theories [] (IETs) have been efficient statistical-mechanical tools in analyzing the structure and properties of a solvent and the solvation thermodynamics of solvophobic and solvophilic solutes.The most important solvent is water, and the IETs for molecular fluids, which are applicable to water and solute hydration, have been developed and employed in a variety of studies.

## Solvent extraction: the coordination chemistry behind extractive 
Abstract. The modes of action of the commercial solvent extractants used in extractive hydrometallurgy are classified according to whether the recovery process involves the transport of metal cations, M n +, metalate anions, MX x n âˆ’, or metal salts, MX x into a water-immiscible solvent. Well-established principles of coordination chemistry provide an explanation for the remarkable strengths

##  Solvent Extraction/ Ion Exchange for Metal Separation and Recovery
Copper : The solvent extraction process has been used for the production of copper first time in 1964 from dilute leach solutions containing low metallic values obtained during processing of low grade ores. In this process copper is extracted from the leach solution using substituted hydroxyoxime, LIX64N.

## Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process Made  - Copper
Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology, commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or, SX/EW Process, was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today, worldwide, approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.

## Studies on solvent extraction of copper and cyanide from waste cyanide 
Copper can be effectively extracted from alkaline cyanide solutions by both extractants. The free cyanide remains in the aqueous phase due to the preferential extraction of Cu (CN) (3) (2-) over Cu (CN) (4) (3-) and CN (-) by the extractants. The selectivity of the metals with the extractants under different cyanide levels has been examined.
