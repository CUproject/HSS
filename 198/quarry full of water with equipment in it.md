## Equipment Used in Quarries
Excavators: An excavator is a piece of hydraulic equipment that is used to dig and excavate materials that are deep in the earth.The excavator is a popular piece of equipment on typical construction sites, particularly when laying foundation for houses. However, for quarrying, the high-capacity excavators are key in unearthing and digging out raw materials that are found deep in quarries.

## Quarry Dewatering And Water Abstraction Licences: Everything To Know
Jan 21, 2021by Bill Noakes January 21, 2021. Quarries need to be dewatered to allow for the safe and profitable extraction of minerals. Since 1991, quarries have not been required to carry a licence for dewatering, but changes to regulations now mean that, after December 2019, quarries are required to apply for an abstraction licence before dewatering.
