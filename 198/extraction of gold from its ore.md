Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

Answer. In the cyanide process for extraction of gold and silver from ores, the cyanide solution acts as a: (A) Reducing agent to reduce the gold and silver compounds in the ores into metallic states. (B) Leaching agent to bring the gold and silver into the solution as cyanide complexes and thus separate these metals from the ores.

Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

May 7, 2021These minerals are called ores. Extraction of Metals. You have learned about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how extraction of metals take place or how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth's crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## How to Extract Gold From Ore? | Mining Pedia
Feb 11, 2022The percolation cyanidation method is also one of the cyanide leaching processes. Its principle is that the cyanide solution penetrates through the ore layer to leach the gold from the gold-bearing ore. It is suitable for alluvial and loose porous materials. There are two kinds of percolation cyanidation methods: pool leaching and heap leaching.
