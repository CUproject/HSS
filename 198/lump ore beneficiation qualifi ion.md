Existing installations of the REFLUX™ Classifier have focussed on the beneficiation of particles in the 0.250 to 2.0 mm size range. Significant interest has emerged in the coal industry in the processing of particles up to 4.0 mm in size, with new research funding directed to the establishment of a full-scale facility (FIG 2), located at a plant just one hour from the University.

## The value of mineralogical analysis for iron ore mining and beneficiation
Oct 8, 2020This "Mineralogy in Mining" blog series started with a general overview of the value of mineralogical monitoring for an efficient ore beneficiation.During the last decades high-grade iron ore deposits, particularly in Western Australia, required hardly any downstream processing. Iron ores were simply crushed and shipped as lump ore for iron making.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Impact of quality of iron ore lumps on sustainability of mining 
The quality of lumps may have a significant impact in iron ore mining systems with implications for mineral reserve recovery rates. Improving the quality of lump ore, through a simple yet innovative mineral processing, can maximize recovery of reserves, decrease waste generation, and increase the productivity and sustainability of mines by allowing transition to lower quality iron ores.
