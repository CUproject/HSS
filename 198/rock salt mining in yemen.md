Salt can be found across the globe, but there is no one way in which it can be obtained. Today we rely on 3 main methods to source salt: Through the evaporation of sea water, Mining rocky-salt formations within the earth, Creating salt brines.

· One of three Cargill mines in the U.S. that produce rock salt used to deice winter roads, Avery produces about 2 million tons of salt a year — roughly the same amount as its Lansing mine beneath Cayuga Lake. The other Cargill salt mine under Lake Erie near Cleveland produces about 3 million tons a year.
