## What's the Difference Between Ball Mill, Rod Mill and SAG Mill?
Ball mill： Ball mills are the most widely used one. Rod mill： The rod mill has the highest efficiency when the feed size is <30mm and the discharge size is about 3mm with uniform particle size and light overcrushing phenomenon. SAG mill: When the weight of the SAG mill is more than 75%, the output is high and the energy consumption is low

## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials, and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement, silicates, refractory material, fertilizer, glass ceramics, etc., as well as for ore dressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The ball mill can grind ores and other materials, wet or dry.

## Mill (grinding)
Ball mill. A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill. A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.

## Ball Mills - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Ball Mills or Rod Mills in a complete range of sizes up to 10′ diameter x 20′ long, offer features of operation and convertibility to meet your exact needs. They may be used for pulverizing and either wet or dry grinding systems. Mills are available in both light-duty and heavy-duty construction to meet your specific requirements.

## Ball Mills - The Ceramic Shop
Ball mills can be used to further break down or refine a single material, or you can place multiple materials into a ball mill jar to mix as you pulverize -- this is a very common industrial solution for mixing glazes that require the smallest of mesh sizes. Ball mills basically function like a mortar and pestle, but on a much larger scale.
