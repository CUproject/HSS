## Coal | Properties, Formation, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Coal Formation. The process of turning dead vegetation into coal is called coalification. In the geological past there were low wetlands and dense forests in various regions.  Knowing the physical properties of coal is important in the preparation and use of coal. For example, coal density ranges from about 1.1 to about 1.5 megagrams per

## Coal: Anthracite, Bituminous, Coke, Pictures, Formation, Uses - Geology
Coke production remains an important use of coal. Coke is produced by heating coal under controlled conditions in the absence of air. This drives off some of the volatile materials and concentrates the carbon content. Coke is then used as a high-carbon fuel for metal processing and other uses where an especially hot-burning flame is needed.

The use of coal as fuel causes ill health and deaths. Mining and processing of coal causes air and water pollution. Coal-powered plants emit nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate pollution and heavy metals, which adversely affect human health. Coal bed methane extraction is important to avoid mining accidents.

If coal is high in sulfur or other impurities, it is washed with a water or chemical bath, removing up to 40 percent of inorganic sulfur in the coal. Not all coal is prepared using the same process. High-sulfur coal commonly undergoes washing to meet environmental regulations, while low-sulfur coal is often crushed and resized without being washed.
