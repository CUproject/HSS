## Uranium: How is it Mined? - New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral 
For both traditional underground and open pit mining, the rocks may have only a few percent (normally <0.3%) uranium in them. The uranium then has to be removed from the rock and concentrated. The milling process involves crushing and pulverizing the rock into very fine fragments and adding water to create a slurry.

## Release of Uranium from Uraninite in Granites Through Alteration 
Aug 1, 2021Uraninite is the main contributor to the bulk-rock uranium concentration in many U-rich granites and is the most important uranium source for granite-related uranium deposits. However, detailed textural and compositional evolution of magmatic uraninite in granites during alteration and associated uranium mobilization have not been well documented.
