## Surface and Highwall Mining Equipment - Mining Technology
Highwall mining is a hybrid form of mining that accesses coal reserves from the base of an exposed highwall. It is typically used when the surface mining operation reaches the economic limitation imposed by the stripping ratio. Highwall mining can extract the remaining ore at low capital cost than underground mining and uses different equipment

Above ground, or surface mining, includes strip mining, open-pit mining, and mountaintop removal mining. Essentially, surface mining is the term used to describe any mining where the rock overlying the mineral deposit is removed. In underground mining, the overlying rock is left intact. Minerals are removed via shafts and tunnels.
