## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Mining is the practice of extracting ore, coal, clays, soils, or minerals from the ground for the purpose of using them. Mines have existed for thousands of years. In ancient times mines consisted of short tunnels dug into the sides of hills or mountains where veins of metals, minerals, or coal had been discovered on the surface.

Coal is one of the most controversial sources of modern energy. In America about 29% of the electricity we use is generated by power plants that burn coal. Coal is a plentiful but non-renewable resource. But coal is a form of carbon and when we burn coal we release carbon into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.
