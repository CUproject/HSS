## Aluminium smelting plantring-in
Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina, generally by the Hall-Héroult process. Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery. This is an electrolytic process, so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electric power; smelters tend to be located close to large power stations, often.

## How to prevent self-heating of coal cargo - SAFETY4SEA
In its latest Stop Loss publication, London P&I Club analyzed problems associated with the transportation of bulk coal cargo, such as self-heating and methane release.  If the LEL-methane continues to rise after ventilation has been carried out continuously for a period of 24 hours, or if CO levels begin to rise, then the advice of an expert
