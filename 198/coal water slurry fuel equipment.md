## Coal slurry fuel technology - DeepDyve
Volatile oil markets experienced in the seventies have promoted renewed interest in coal‐based fuel technologies. Coal‐slurry fuels have emerged as viable technical alternatives for oil and gas in utility and industrial boilers. Despite current low prices and the abundance of oil, concerns over its long‐term availability and price, as well as strategic considerations, make coal‐slurry

## Coal slurry
Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed coal and water, which can be efficiently separated. In practice, the separation is significantly costly due to the large amounts of water needed and wastewater generated by the process. Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called blackwater.As blackwater cannot be purified by a water treatment plant

Coal-water slurry fuels. The abbreviation for coal-water slurry fuels should be CWSF, but either CWF or CWS is used, with the distinction that CWF is, indeed, a fuel for combustion. CWS may be a fuel, or it may be a slurry prepared for coal transportation in a pipeline, in which case usually with a much coarser PSD.

## Production of coal-water slurry fuel with AVS
One of the most promising new products is coal water slurry fuel - a mixture of coal particles (fraction 1 . 70 μm), water and reagent. It is characterized by a good heating value and a high degree of combustion. Advantages of coal-water slurry fuel. ignition temperature is ° C; combustion temperature - ° С;

## CNA - Coal-water slurry combustion method and its combustion 
The invention relates to a methods and combustion equipment for burning coal water mixture, the method is that atomized coal water mixture is spurted in combustion chamber for suspension combustion, combustion flame gradually form high temperature gas in process of flowing forward, make the combustion-supporting air form a suspension combustion-supporting air driving field in hearth and return
