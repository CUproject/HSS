Oct 2, 2021What is Coarse Aggregate? The Aggregates which will get retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve and will pass through a 3-inch sieve are known as Coarse aggregate. The aggregates used in the production of concrete are inert granular materials such as gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, and recycled concrete.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - The Constructor
Coarse aggregate passing 12.5mm IS sieve and retained on a10mm IS sieve are selected and heated at 100 to 110°C for 4 hours and cooled to room temperature.  Aggregate crushing value = (W2 x 100) / (W1-W)  Classification of Aggregates as per Size and Shape -Coarse and Fine Aggregates Grain Size Analysis of Aggregates - Particle Size
