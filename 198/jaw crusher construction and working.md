## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

Jaw crushers are reliable, robust machines, offering a 6:1 reduction ratio in most applications, and will accommodate hard, abrasive materials. Or The single-toggle crusher is the simplest and the lightest of the jaw crushers but is suitable only for producing low crushing forces and therefore used for soft rocks.

Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.
