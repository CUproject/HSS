Limestone, when heated, gives lime which is used to neutralize acids. Also, lime is used to treat wastewater, animal waste, industrial sludge, and water supplies. Lime is also used to control odor by filtering the water. Lime is used as a chemical agent known as flux. Flux removes phosphorous, sulfur, and silica from the steel, making it purer.

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
