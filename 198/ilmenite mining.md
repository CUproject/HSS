Ilmenite is the titanium-iron oxide mineral with the idealized formula FeTiO3. It is a weakly magnetic black or steel-gray solid. From the commercial perspective, ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium. Ilmenite is the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics.

May 30, 2022Ilmenite is a weakly magnetic mineral. Is ilmenite radioactive? Both synthetic rutile and ilmenite contain radioactive elements such as Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. The probability of exposure to radiation due to decay of radioactive products is high depending on the dose rate and the activity levels during processing of these materials.

What is ilmenite structure? Ilmenite is an iron-oxide mineral of the oxide and hydroxide group with structural formula (Fe,Ti) 2 O 3. The structure is similar to that of hematite, where the two Fe 3 + in hematite are replaced by one Fe 2 + and one Ti 4 + in ilmenite.  Ilmenite is a weakly magnetic mineral.

## (PDF) Ilmenite Smelting at Ticor SA | Hanlie Kotze
The three South African based producers of TiO2 feedstock - Richards Bay Minerals, Namakwa Sands, and Ticor South Africa (Ticor SA), all produce TiO2 slag via the smelting of ilmenite. The whole industry - from mining of heavy mineral deposits through to pigment manufacturing - is highly competitive, with little sharing of metallurgical

## Ilmenite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
An ilmenite-structured (Mg, Fe)SiO 3 mineral has now been identified in natural meteorite samples, and it has been named 'akimotoite' (Tomioka and Fujino, 1999). Laboratory experiments also indicate that (Mg,Fe)SiO 3 ilmenite can enter into solid solution with Al 2 O 3 component under mantle high-P,T conditions (Liu, 1977).

## Rutile and ilmenite prices increase - Beach Minerals
We are looking forward to a period of sustained recovery in the mineral sands sector," one mineral sands supplier said. Sources noted that prices for ilmenite in China have increased by 50% since the start of the year. "The sulphate ilmenite market has rebounded fast, we've seen an increase from $80 up to $120 to China," one source said.
