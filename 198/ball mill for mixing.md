## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

## Ball mill | PyroData
Ball mill. A ball mill, a type of crusher, is a cylindrical device used to grind chemicals or mix compositions. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium, ideally non sparking milling media like lead balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder.

## How to Make a Ball Mill: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow
1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.

Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.
