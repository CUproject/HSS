Pulverization. Pulverization takes place by impact, attrition, or crushing. Figure 1.12 shows a ball-race mill which grinds by crushing. The lower race is turned by a motor, causing the balls to rotate. Coal enters the center of the mill and is thrown out against the moving balls which crush it against the races.
