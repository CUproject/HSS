## Mineral Processing - Magnetic & Electrostatic Separation
High Gradient Magnetic Separator • For separation of material with less magnetic susceptibility, high magnetic forces are required. An efficient way to produce high magnetic forces is the use of solenoids in the gap of a magnetic circuit. The core or working volume is fitted with a matrix of secondary poles, each producing ≤2T field strength and gradient≤14T/mm. Due to the small working

Electrophoresis is the motion of a charged body or particle under the influence of an electric field. Simply put, like charges repel and unlike charges attract one another. An electrostatic mineral separation uses electrophoresis when the force acting on a particle is due to the interaction of an electric field and a charged particle.

Beneficiation of phosphate ores by dry electrostatic processes has been attempted by various researchers since the 1940's. The underlying reasons for developing dry processes for phosphate recovery are the limited amount of water in some arid regions, the flotation chemical costs, and the waste water treatment costs. While electrostatic processes may not provide a complete alternative to

Conclusion. Phosphate is a key component in sustaining healthy and productive crops. While most phosphate rock goes to the production of MAP and DAP fertilizers, this life-giving mineral can be made into a variety of fertilizer products and blends through the process of granulation.

Electrostatic Separation is a type of dry mineral processing that is more environmentally friendly and takes up less energy. Dry mineral processing may also provide a higher purity mineral product than wet mineral processing.
