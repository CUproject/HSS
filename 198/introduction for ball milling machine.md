Mar 23, 2022The working principle of the ball mill is that the whole frame supports the ball mill barrel, and the motor of the tail device drives the ball mill bearing to make the ball mill rotate clockwise. The rotation is not the main purpose. Balls and materials make the steel balls and materials realize parabolic motion, and during the movement, forces such as impact, impact and self-grinding occur

## Introduction of Milling Machine - Liming Heavy Industry
Introduction of Ball Milling Machine: Ball mill is an efficient tool for grinding many materials into fine powder. The Ball Mill is used to grind many kinds of mine and other materials, or to select the mine. It is widely used in building material, stone industry, etc. There are two ways of grinding: the dry way and the wet way.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.
