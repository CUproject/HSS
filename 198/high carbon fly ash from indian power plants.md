## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Fly ash bricks account for about one-sixth of India's annual brick production, putting over 20 million tons of fly ash to productive use each year. So far, the World Bank project has enabled 108 fly ash brick plants to earn about $3.2 million, or approximately Rs. 14.5 crores, in carbon credit revenues.

## Very high volume fly ash green concrete for applications in India
Safe disposal of fly ash generated by coal-based thermal power plants continues to pose significant challenges around the world and in India in particular. Green structural concrete with 80% cement replaced by local Chinese fly ash has been recently developed to achieve a target characteristic compressive strength of 45 MPa.

Feb 21, 2022During, Indian coal-based thermal power plants produced 226.13 million tonnes of coal ash (fly ash + bottom ash) which urged for safe disposal from an environmental point of view. Though as per the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and Climate Change (CC) notification dated 3rd November 2009, 100% disposal of fly ash has to be effected in dry form for gainful utilisation

## Characterization of High Carbon Ash from Thermal Power Station Using 
Abstract Fly ash collected from a local captive power plant has been fully characterized in respect of its physico-chemical, morphological, and mineralogical features. The high carbon ash consists of large unburnt, irregular carbonaceous particles, which appear to be porous. The non-magnetic particles are more irregular in shape as compared to their magnetic counterpart. Fe bearing

Oct 24, 2020 "Power plants in India produce about 600,000 tonnes of fly ash per day or 219 million metric tonnes of fly ash per year. This is equal to India's total cement consumption in a year. For cement production, with 650 kilograms of clinkers, one cannot mix more than 350 kilograms of fly ash.

## NOx control for high-ash coal-fired power plants in India
Introduction. Since the 1970s various technologies to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x) have been used in countries with relevant emission standards.However, this is not the case in India, which has high-ash coals and until recently did not have NO x emission standards. NO x emissions control legislation has been introduced and NO x control retrofits are expected on a large scale.

A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel

Disposal and management of fly ash is a major problem in coal-fired thermal power plants. Fly ash emissions from a variety of coal combustion units show a wide range of composition. All elements below atomic number 92 are present in coal ash. A 500 MW thermal power plant releases 200 mt SO2, 70 t NO2 and 500 t fly ash approximately every day.

## Fly Ash Bricks: Brick production using fly-ash from thermal power 
Three hundred million tonnes of fly ash are produced a year in India, causing severe respiratory problems to Indian population. Furthermore, power plant operators face significant costs for disposal of fly ash. Alternative brick production and sale of bricks with low carbon content creates a mutual win-win situation for both power plant
