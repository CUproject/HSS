## Case Study: Coal and Ash Handling - CDM Systems, Inc.
North Dakota's abundant coal reserves made it an economical fuel that offers high heat content (BTU) per ton. The material handling system, engineered and manufactured by CDM, started with a truck receiving conveyor. The conveyor was designed to handle material flow rates of 55 TPH to ensure the plant never ran short on fuel.

## Coal preparation plant
A coal preparation plant (CPP; also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP), coal handling plant, prep plant, tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock, crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting), stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market, and more often than not, also loads coal into rail cars, barges, or ships.

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.

## Basic Hydraulic System - COAL HANDLING PLANTS
1. Reservoir / Oil Tank. They are used to hold the hydraulic oil. 2. Hydraulic Pump. They are used to pressurized the hydraulic fluid and force the fluid through the system.There are three types of hydraulic pump: I. Fixed Displacement Pump - These pump has a set flow rate means every stroke of the motor moves same amount of fluid.

## Coal Processing And Handling Plant - Coal Handling System Manufacturer 
Voltage. V. Frequency. 50-60 Hz. n a coal based thermal power plant, the initial process in the power generation is "Coal Handling". So in this article i will discuss the overall processes carried out at a Coal Handling plant in a coal based thermal power generating station. The huge amount of coal is usually supplied through railways.
