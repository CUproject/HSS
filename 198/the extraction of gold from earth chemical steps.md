## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

Feb 24, 2021Extracting value of gold is not just about removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground. This is just the first step in the process of mining gold. Complex extraction processes are involved in the isolation of pure gold from the rock. First, the large chunks of rock are broken down. With the help of crushers, the ore is reduced to tiny pieces.

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

 Mercury (quicksilver) has a chemical affinity for gold. When mercury is added to gold-bearing materi-al, the two metals form an amalgam. Mercury is later separated from amalgam by retorting. Extraction of gold and other precious metals from their ores by treatment with mercury is called amalgamation.

Extraction of metals. The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground. The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.
