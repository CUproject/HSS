There are two ways to activate the servo drives: the open-loop system and the closed- loop system. Saturday, 16 May 2015Bhanu PS Tomar3 4.

A system in which controlling action is independent of the generated system output is known as open-loop control system. While in a closed-loop system, the produced output controls the functioning of the system by the used of feedback. Basically a closed-loop system was designed to overcome the disadvantages associated with an open-loop system.

Any system that can respond to the changes and make corrections by itself is known as a closed-loop control system. The only difference between open-loop and closed-loop systems is the feedback action. The block diagram of a closed-loop control system is shown in the Figure below.

## What is a closed loop control system and how does it work?
closed loop control system: A closed loop control system is a set of mechanical or electronic devices that automatically regulates a process variable to a desired state or set point without human interaction. Closed loop control systems contrast with open loop control systems, which require manual input.

The open loop system gives the fast response, whereas the closed loop system gives the slow response. The calibration of open loop system is difficult as compared to the closed-loop system. In an open loop system, the disturbance affected the output, whereas in a closed loop system the output is not much affected by the disturbances.

A block diagram representation in which there is only one forward and feedback block along with a single summing point and take-off point is the simplest form of closed-loop control system. It is also known as the canonical form of a closed-loop system. The figure below shows a simple closed-loop system:

## Closed Loop Control System : Block Diagram, Types & Its  - ElProCus
Definition: A closed-loop control system can be defined as, a system that has a feedback loop (or) a control system that uses a feedback signal to generate the output. The stability of this system can be controlled by a feedback system. So by providing a feedback system, any open-loop control system can be changed into a closed loop.

## CNC Machine | How it works, Parts and Block Diagram
The CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control. When the computers are used to control a Numerical Control (NC) machine tool then the machine is called a CNC machine. In simple words, the use of computers to control machine tools like lathe, mills, shaper, etc. is called the CNC machine. Cutting operations performed by CNC is called CNC machining.
