Garnet Advantages. 1. Lower contaminants : Super garnet is preferred worldwide owing to its 99% purity in terms of mineralogical content. Silica and ilmenite are the two other commonly found contaminants in the garnet. Higher % of free silica can cause silicosis hazard and also have impact on the performance of the blasting or cutting operation.
