## Characterisation Of Platinum Electrode Modified With Phosphate Rock For 
In the present paper we report the characterization of platinum electrode modified with a polymeric membrane. The use of natural minerals such as phosphate rock (PR) from the mine of Djebel Onk (Algeria) was investigated as ionophore for Cd2+ ions detection. The impedance data were adjusted from 100 mHz to 100 kHz and at polarisation - 200 mV.
