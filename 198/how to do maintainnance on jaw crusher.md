Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.
