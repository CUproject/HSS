## Secondary Crushing Equipment - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The term "secondary crushing" has become well established and familiar through long usage; it applies to the crushing stage, either single or multiple, which follows immediately after the primary crusher, taking all or a portion of the product of the primary crushing stage as its feed.The term should not be used, as it sometimes is, to designate a particular type or size of crusher because

Ideally, the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusher. The feed size to a secondary crusher is typically in the range of 50 mm to 250 mm (up to 300 mm). If the capacity is higher, the acceptable feed size gets larger.

Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm. Secondary jaw or cone crushers should be selected for hard and abrasive materials to maintain optimum operating costs.

Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that
