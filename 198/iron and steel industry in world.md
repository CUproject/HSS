The world produces about 851 million tons (766 million metric tons) of raw steel each year. This total is higher than that for pig iron because only about 1,250 pounds (567 kilograms) of pig iron are used in a mix to make each 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms), or one short ton (0.91 metric ton), of steel.

## Steel industry in Luxembourg
Luxembourgish steel industry generally produced iron bars, wrought iron and cast iron. Due to the weak domestic market, most of this was exported to workshops in Liège, which used the iron in their manufactured products which were exported from Dutch ports.  In 1974 the world steel market collapsed due to over-production.
