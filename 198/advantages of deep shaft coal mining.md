Several important functions are performed by shaft lining. This lining acts as a safety layer preventing the fall of loose or unstable rocks into the shaft. It is also a place for shaft sets to be bolted into and it is a smooth surface to allow free flow of air for ventilation. Shaft lining is almost always dependent on the geology of the rock.

## What is deep coal mining and open cast mining? What are the advantages 
Explanation: When coal is located in deep below Earth we have to adopt deep mining. Open cast mining.Only remove the top layer debris of rocks and w get coal..Huge trucks can come down through slopes and remove and load, transport coal..This is cheaper and less dangerous.

## History of coal mining
Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits.As well as drift mines, small scale shaft mining was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with
