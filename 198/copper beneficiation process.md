## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Jan 25, 2022Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.
