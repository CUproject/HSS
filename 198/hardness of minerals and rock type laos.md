## Hardness: Mineral Properties - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom
Hardness is defined by how well a substance will resist scratching by another substance. For example, if mineral A scratches mineral B, and mineral B does not scratch mineral A, then mineral A is harder than mineral B. If mineral A and B both scratch each other, then their hardness is equal. A scale to measure hardness was devised by Austrian

Hardness (H) is the resistance of a mineral to scratching. It is a property by which minerals may be described relative to a standard scale of 10 minerals known as the Mohs scale of hardness. The degree of hardness is determined by observing the comparative ease or difficulty with which one mineral is scratched by another or by a steel tool. For measuring the hardness of a mineral, several

Measures of water hardness. Hardness is caused by compounds of calcium and magnesium, and by a variety of other metals. General guidelines for classification of waters are: 0 to 60 mg/L (milligrams per liter) as calcium carbonate is classified as soft; 61 to 120 mg/L as moderately hard; 121 to 180 mg/L as hard; and more than 180 mg/L as very hard.

Rocks. Rock is the solid mineral material forming the surface of the earth. A rock is composed of one or more minerals. Petrology is the science of rocks which includes the studying of mineral composition, structure, texture, origin, occurrence, alteration and relationship with other rocks. The age of a rock is determined based on carbon-14 dating.
