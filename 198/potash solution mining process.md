## Solution mining
Solution mining entails the injection of brine solutions into underground potash-bearing or other salt seams. The solution dissolves soluble potash-bearing minerals from the seam, and the pregnant potash-bearing solution is then recovered to the surface for processing. Solution mining techniques, focused on caverns in halite, are discussed in

The hot leaching method of ore processing is based on the physicochemical properties of NaCl-KCl-H2O system. The main principle of this method is the different temperature-depending degree of solubility of the mineral components - sylvite and halite: the high solubility of potassium chloride from ore by cycling solution at 115°C and the further crystallization of the valuable component on

Sep 17, 2021Potash or potassium salts are produced through two primary sources; brines and evaporite deposits. The two most common and economically important potassium sources are sulfate of potash (K 2 SO 4 - SOP) and muriate of potash (KCl - MOP). Evaporite deposits are usually quite deep, and are either mined through underground mining or in-situ solution mining.

Mining engineers stop short of their targeted cavern footprint so the secondary mining process can be initiated. By injecting hot brine into the cavern, the roof and walls begin to slowly dissolve the potash. During all stages of the solution mining process an oil blanket is injected into the cavern to prevent uncontrolled vertical mining.

Once the potash has settled, the pond water is re-injected into the mine and the process starts over again. How the brine becomes contaminated The solution mining process requires hot water to dissolve the potassium chloride underground. Once the mixture is above ground, it needs to be cooled, which takes place in open ponds using ambient air.
