## What is grade of concrete, mix ratio and water cement ratio?
Jul 20, 2022For making M20 grade mix we will consider 1:1.5:3 and. For making M25 grade mix we will consider 1:1:2. For example consider M15 grade concrete which is having mix ratio of 1:2: 4, Where 1 indicates the cement proportion, 2 indicates the fine aggregates proportion and 4 indicates the coarse aggregates proportion.

## M25 Concrete Ratio Calculation
Apr 13, 2022M25 Concrete Cement Required. Volume of cement = (Cement Proportion / Sum of Ratio) x Dry Volume of Concrete. Cement = (1/4) x 1.54 = 0.385 cubic meter. As we know that density of Cement is 1.44 gm/cm 3 or 1440 kg/m3. Therefore, multiply volume of cement with its specific gravity to get weight of cement.

## Rate Analysis Of Concrete - M25 Concrete Example Rate Analysis
Assume We need 1 m3 of wet volume concrete of M25 Mix, (Mix Ratio, M25 = 1: 1 : 2) So Total Parts = 1+1+2 = 4 Parts which gives Dry volume that means before adding water content. Volume of concrete = (1 Cement Part)/4 + (1 Sand Part)/4 + (2 Coarse Aggregate Part)/4. From the IS Code standard, Assuming the water-cement ratio for M20 is 0.5.

## Concrete Mix Design as per IS Code - Civil Wale
The proportion and the ratio, in which the materials should be mixed together to obtain a certain grade of the concrete, has already been specified by IS 456:2000. But the limitation of the code is, that it specifies the ratios of the materials, up to a certain grade, which is M25, beyond which, no certain proportion has been industrially approved.

## Nominal IS Code Concrete Mix Ratio Calculator Metric
This concrete mix ratio calculator is one of the simplest calculators that determines the amount of cement, sand, gravel, and water for your mixture. All you have to do is first choose the grade of concrete, such as M5, M7.5, M10, M15, M20, or M25. Then, enter the volume you need in cubic meters.

## How much cement sand & aggregate required for m25 concrete
mix ratio for m25 concrete = 1:1:2. We have to do following calculating steps:- Step 1 :-we have wet volume of concrete is equal to 1 cubic metre (1m3), but when we calculate actual quantity of dry ingredient cement, sand and aggregate of concrete we have to calculate dry volume of concrete. For converting wet volume to dry volume of concrete we will multiply 1.54 in wet volume of concrete
