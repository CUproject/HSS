## Modern rehabilitation of the Melville legacy coal mining site
May 21, 2021Steve Campbell leases land near the Melville site and says it has been terrific to see the rehabilitation take place. "The shape of the site is now virtually the same as before mining took place, and in time there will be trees on the site as well. The comments of people that traverse the Wandobah Rd asking what was happening has been extensive.

Land disturbance because of coal mining is classified into two groups: (1) land disturbed by surface mining (strip-mining and open-pit mining) and (2) land disturbed by underground mining. The changes in the environment effected by the coal industry are so profound that often no natural recovery of disturbed landscapes can occur.
