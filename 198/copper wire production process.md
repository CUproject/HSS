## Manufacturing Process of Copper Wires | Optimum Quality  - Blogger
The process of copper wire manufacturing includes series of steps. Initially it is worked upon to form copper rods which are later transformed into wires. The oxide ore are been leached in weak acid solution that forms a weak copper sulfate solution. This copper laden solution is been treated in an electrolytic process tank.

## Copper Production Processes :: Total Materia Article
Several different processes can be used for copper production. The old traditional process is based on roasting, smelting in reverbatory furnaces or electric furnaces for more complex ores, producing matte and converting for production of blister copper which is further refined to cathode copper.

## How Cables are Made - Start to Finish - CableWholesale
After the copper has been formed into a strand, it is very stiff and frail. In order to become flexible, the wire will go through a process called "annealing," which means that the wire must be treated with heat to become malleable. Heating the wire will also help relieve any internal stresses inside the wire, as well as to soften the surface

Step 1: Wire drawing. In the first step, our aim is to acquire metal (usually copper or aluminum) wires that fit with AWG (American Wire Gauge). The method is to pull the copper or aluminum rod through a series of synthetic diamond dies, which gradually decrease in size, on the draw bench. And this is processing with a lubricating and cooling

Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), sometimes referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) and metal active gas (MAG) is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable MIG wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to fuse (melt and join).. No separate shielding gas is applied separately.
