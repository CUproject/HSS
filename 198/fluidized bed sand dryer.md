## What is the purpose of fluidizing?sewing
Fluidized-bed granulation is a process by which granules are produced in a single piece of equipment by spraying a binder solution on to a fluidized powder bed. As with any granulating system, in fluid-bed granulation processing, the goal is to form agglomerated particles using binder bridges between the particles.

2005). The major parts of the fluidized bed reactors are: the fluidization vessel, the solids discharge, dust separator for the exit gas, the air supply and heat supply. A fluidized bed is a vessel containing a bed of solid particles, e.g. sand or catalytically active particles, and a method of introducing gas from below.

## Determination on Fluidization Velocity Types of the Continuous Refined 
1.1 Preface. The phenomenon in which solid particles float in a gas stream and have a liquid-like property is called a fluidized bed. This phenomenon of fluidization in gas or liquid flow was discovered by Fritz Winkler in the 1920s [].This one was investigated by Lewis et al. and had been raised to fluidized theory [].The first commercial fluidized bed dryer was installed in USA in 1948 [].

## Bed height and material density effects on fluidized bed hydrodynamics
Increasing bed height, particularly at the higher gas flow rates, enhanced bubble coalescence creating slugs that flow thorough the center of the bed, producing regions of low gas holdup near the walls of the fluidized bed. Also, the effects of bed height observed in the time-average local gas holdup vary depending of the bed material tested.
