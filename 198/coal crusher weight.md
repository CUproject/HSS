## Hammermill Crushers | McLanahan
Hammermill Crushers are known to generate material finer than 3/16" (4mm), which in some applications may be undesirable. However, if there is a market for finer material, or if it is acceptable within the desired product size, Hammermills can achieve reduction ratios that may otherwise require multiple crushers.

In the eastern U.S., where a majority of the coal production is washed, primary crushers are usually reducing a 20- to 24-inch feed to a more easily conveyed 4- to 6-inch top size. In the West, especially at large surface mines such as those found in the Powder River Basin (PRB), the raw feed to the primary crusher can be as high as 60 to 70

## Coal comminution and sizing - ScienceDirect
Schematic of roll crushers for coal breakage: (a) single-roll crusher; (b) double-roll crusher. Single-roll crushers may be either feeder-breakers, or conventional rolls. The rolls on feeder-breakers resemble the cutting head of continuous coal mining machines.  F = Material weight factor, accounting for the change in feed density.
