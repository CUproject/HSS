## Sand washer can be used in the quartz sand production line in Brazil 
What are the classifications of quartz sand. 1. Ordinary quartz sand: The surface of ordinary quartz sand seems to have a layer of yellow skin, and some have large particles and strong fire resistance. It is a kind of quartz sand processed by the manufacturer after using natural quartz ore in the production process, such as washing and drying.

## quartz sand manufacturing equipment and process
Â· Quartz sand, also known as silica sand, is a common non-metallic mineral material, and its application area is very extensive. The mineral processing and purification of quartz sand in China and its deep processing and exploitation are relatively late, and are mainly used in the construction industry, glass manufacturing, ceramic industry and foundry industry.
