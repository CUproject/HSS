## Sand washer can be used in the quartz sand production line in Brazil 
What are the classifications of quartz sand. 1. Ordinary quartz sand: The surface of ordinary quartz sand seems to have a layer of yellow skin, and some have large particles and strong fire resistance. It is a kind of quartz sand processed by the manufacturer after using natural quartz ore in the production process, such as washing and drying.
