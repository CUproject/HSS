## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Circuit In Iron Ore Processing Plant
The complexity degree of a mining plants comminution circuit is critical for allowing the processing of low-grade iron ore deposits. Considering that the comminution stage is responsible for most of the energy consumption in a mineral processing plant, the pursuit of energy-efficient technologies is a major challenge of the mining industry.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total
