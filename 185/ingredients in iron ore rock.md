## Iron Ore Facts
Iron ore is rock which metallic iron can be extracted from. Iron ore is the most common element in the world and makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. This makes it one of the most abundant rock elements. Iron ore that contains a high quality of hematite or magnetite are known as "natural ore" and they can be entered directly into blast furnaces that produce iron.
