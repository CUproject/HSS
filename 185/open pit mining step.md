Sep 11, 2020In this section we give a brief overview on how mineral contents, or ore grades, are usually modeled and simulated in mining. We start in Sect. 2.1 with a typical model for mineral deposits, and then in Sects. 2.2 and 2.3 we show how ore grades are estimated and simulated, respectively. We refer the reader to Chiles and Delfiner for a comprehensive reference on ore-body modeling and geostatistics.

Step 2: Mining PIPE MINING - PRIMARY DEPOSITS. There are two types of pipe mining, namely open-pit mining and underground mining. Open-pit mining involves removing the layers of sand and rock found just above the kimberlite. Once exposed, the ore in the pit is broken up by blasting. A single blast can break approximately 45,000 tonnes of ore.

## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The process of mine planning is an important step before the start of mine development and it continues on day to day basis once the mine becomes operational.  Areas for open pit mining are selected using the mining plan. Identified areas are then tagged. The ore is mined from large open pits by progressive extraction along steps or benches.

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness
