## Plant Adaptation Definition and Examples in Details
Jan 12, 2021Morphological adaptation: Root: generally, poorly developed root system where root hair is absent and root pockets are present instead of the root cap. Stem: soft, succulent, spongy, and sometimes modified to offset (water hyacinth) or rhizome (water lily).(Soft stem protects a hydrophytic plant from the stress of water current.) Leaves: soft, succulent, sometimes very short (Hydrilla

The plants here have deep roots to survive the prairie fires. Some trees have thick barks to survive the fires. Roots extend deep into the ground to absorb water.

Constant exposure to mutagens, such as UV and ionizing radiation, chemicals, heat, drought, and cold, forces plants to either adapt or die. Nuclear testing, leakage of radioactive wastes, and nuclear accidents such as the Chernobyl disaster have compelled scientists to confront the effects of chronic ionizing radiation exposure on all organisms (Dubrova et al., 1996; Ellegren et al., 1997

Cold stress adversely affects plant growth, development, and yield. Also, the spatial and geographical distribution of plant species is influenced by low temperatures.

This paper reviews the use of in vitro and in vivo antimutagenicity studies that determined the role of plant peroxidases in the activation of arylamine promutagens. New information presented here suggests a model in which tobacco cell peroxidases exuded into the culture medium undergo a maturation process affecting their capacity to activate

## Adaptations in plants - Olympiad Genius
Adaptations in plants. Plants on mountains are tall, straight and cone-shaped. Due to cone shape snow does not accumulate on them and slips. They are generally flowerless. They have needle-like leaves. e.g. Pine, Deodar and Fir. Cactus leaves are reduced to spines due to adaptation. Spine shaped leaves help cactus to survive in hot conditions.

## Letter from Stephanie: Antarctic Adaptations | AMNH
Physical adaptations are sometimes the easiest to spot. Many of the animals living in Antarctica have outer layers of dense fur or water-repellent feathers. Under this fur or feather layer is a thick layer of insulating fat. Many marine animals have large eyes to help them spot prey and predators in the dark waters.

## Plant Adaptations - Teachers (U.S. National Park Service)
1) Have students list what plants need to survive, and be sure that they include water, soil, and sunlight. Discuss characteristics of the desert that make it difficult for plants to grow. For example, it is dry, windy, hot in the summer, cold on winter nights, and there are animals that might eat the plants.
