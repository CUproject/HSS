Steam coals for power plants must meet quality and heating characteristics of the boiler design and for the design of pollution-control equipment at a power plant. Grades of steam coal are generally related to sulfur content and ash yield. Typically, the term low-sulfurLow-ash coals are grades of coal with ash yields below 10 percent.

From physical appearance it is very difficult if not impossible to differentiate between non-coking & a coking coal. A non - caking coal is that coal which when heated in the absence of air for e.g. as in the determination of VM, leaves a powdery residue. A non-caking coal is always a non-coking coal.

## What is the difference between thermal coal and steam coal?
Dec 2, 2020The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However the most important distinction is between thermal coal (also known as steam coal), which is burnt to generate electricity via steam; and metallurgical coal (also known as coking coal), which is burnt at high temperature to make steel.
