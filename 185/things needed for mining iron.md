## Metal and Iron Ore Mining | MCR Safety
The Iron Age began around 1200 BC, ending the Bronze Age that preceded it and paving the way to man's mastery of metal. Individuals during this period began extracting iron ore to forge tools and weapons. The reason revolves around Iron being one of the most abundant metals found on earth. Iron makes up 98% of earth's core and 5% of earth

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.
