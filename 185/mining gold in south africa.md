South Africa's Witwatersrand Basin is considered to be the world's largest gold resource; operations in this region contribute to SA's 95,130 mining sector jobs. [2] In recent years, South African gold production has decreased, falling to 4.2% of aggregate global production.

Mining in South Africa has been a contentious issue since 15-year-old Erasmus Stephanus Jacobs discovered South Africa's first diamond, the Eureka, in Hopetown in 1867.  Within a year of gold findings, the area had some 7 000 people with 3 000 living in Johannesburg. By 1895, just nine years after the Langlaagte find, Johannesburg was home

## Gold Mining in South Africa - Gold Rush Nuggets
Today, South Africa has around 80 operating gold mines and a handful of small-scale producers. The industry employs about 95,000 people, although the number of jobs fluctuates with changes in production. Gold mining boosted South Africa's gross domestic product by 360.9 billion Rand in 2019, compared to 351 billion Rand in 2018.

Diamond and gold production are now well down from their peaks, though South Africa is still number 5 in gold [3] but remains a cornucopia of mineral riches. It is the world's largest producer [4] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite. It is the second largest producer [4] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium.

Gold mining activities in the Witwatersrand have played a pivotal role in the development and existence of Johannesburg since 1886. Mining made Johannesburg 'the city of gold' and has since been the main driving force behind the history and the economic development of Johannesburg and South Africa as a whole (Gass, 2012).

## The devastating impact of Gold Mining in South Africa
For 130 years South Africa has been exploiting its gold resources in Johannesburg. But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.

South Africa accounted for 15% of the world's gold production in 2002 and 12% in 2005, though the nation had produced as much as 30% of the yearly world output as recently as 1993. Despite declining production, South Africa's gold exports were valued at US$3.8 billion in 2005. As of end-2018, South Africa had a potential 6000 tonnes of reserves.

A recent GFMS gold survey puts South Africa at the highest end of the cost scale among gold producers, but the country's gold mines remain important. In 2009, South Africa's gold mining industry earned about $6.35 billion in foreign exchange making it the country's second largest exporter behind platinum group-metals at about $7.6 billion.
