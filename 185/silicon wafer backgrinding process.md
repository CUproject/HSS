## USB2 - Method of backgrinding wafers while leaving  - Google
A method of backgrinding wafers wherein backgrinding tape or a pad is applied to the chuck and not to the wafers. The backgrinding tape or pad is left on the chuck as each wafer is sequentially placed on the tape or pad, background, rinsed on the backside, removed from the tape and then cleaned on the front side and backside. A tool for applying tape to a chuck, as described herein

Wafer Backgrinding - Know More. All wafer backgrinding is performed in a class 10K cleanroom with critical thin wafer taping processes performed at a class 100 workstation Because timing is critical, we have streamlined our wafer thinning process so that you can enjoy same-day, 24 hour, or 48 hour cycle tim

## Silicon Wafer Backgrinding Process
Silicon Wafer Backgrinding Process. 2 partial wafer grinding is an efficient grinding method to process broken or damaged wafers, or wafer sections.This technique can be employed to process wafers that had been damaged, or wafer sections that are still intact, thereby avoiding loss of the entire wafer .
