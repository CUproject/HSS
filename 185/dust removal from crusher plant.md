Working principle. The dust collector of the mine crusher is used in the crushing system of the mine to solve the serious problem of excessive dust pollution during the process of ore being crushed, separated and conveyed by the machine. The dust collector box of the crusher is purified, and the dust in the dust is separated from the clean air.
