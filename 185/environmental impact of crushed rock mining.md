## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Mining can often be devastating â€” causing water acidification, soil erosion and the degradation of local ecosystems. While some methods have less impact than others, it almost always has a serious and lasting environmental impact. Fortunately, there is some hope that mining will become more sustainable in the future.

## Office of Wastewater Management - Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts
Hardrock Mining: Environmental Impacts. Overview. Hardrock mining is a large-scale industrial activity that takes place in the natural environment, potentially disturbing large amounts of material and land area. Hardrock mining generates large volumes of mining waste because of the high waste-to-product ratios associated with producing most ores.

In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

Limestone mines use two types of blasting. Small explosive charges set along drilled lines free blocks of stone to be removed for construction. Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.

Unit 3 Reading: Mining and Mining Impacts. In surface mining, approximately 2--3 tons of waste rock is removed for each ton of ore. Underground mining generally creates less waste rock than surface mining; the waste rock is either moved to the surface or used to fill in areas of the mine no longer in use.
