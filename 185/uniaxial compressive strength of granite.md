The longitudinal wave velocity of the rock specimens was measured, and the longitudinal

## The Uniaxial Strength of Rock Material - ASTM International
Abstract. Uniaxial tensile and compressive strength were determined for a granite, a marble, and a sandstone. There was no statistically detectable difference between the strength values of large and small samples, although the volume ratio of the samples was 20 or more. Further, strain gage measurements taken during the compression tests on
