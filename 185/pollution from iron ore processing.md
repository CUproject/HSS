## Steel production & environmental impact - GreenSpec
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.  Coke production is one of the major pollution sources from steel production. Air emissions such as coke oven

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
