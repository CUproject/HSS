## Glass Bead Blasting: Abrasive Shape, Hardness & Recycle Rate
May 6, 2021The shape of the blasting grain is another important factor that is rarely discussed. While glass beads rate about 5.5 hardness on the Mohs Scale, the bead shape puts them at a distinct advantage over other abrasive types. Slags and Garnet have a slightly harder Mohs Scale rating than glass beads, but they have a much weaker grain shape.

May 31, 2021The Mohs scale of mineral hardness (or the Mohs hardness scale) is used by geologists all over the world as an identifying tool for minerals. The basic principal is, that it characterises the scratch resistance of a softer mineral being scratched a harder mineral.

The scale by which the hardness of a mineral is determined as compared with a standard. The most frequently used and quoted hardness scale was devised by Friedrich Mohs about 1820.

Creating a scale of one to ten, he assigned a value to each mineral. This was to become the Mohs Scale of Hardness. In 1817, after the death of Werner, Mohs replaced his mentor and became a tutor at the mining academy in Freiberg, where he worked for nine more years until he was appointed professor of Mineralogy at the University of Vienna.

## Black Sand Concentrates
Black sand concentrates are what you end up with after first processing of your gold bearing material. It is usually a combination of minerals in the iron group: Hematite, Fe3o3, with a specific gravity of 5.26, an iron mineral that is non-magnetic and Magnetite, Fe3o4, with a specific gravity of 5.20, is magnetic.

Corundum is the workhorse abrasive of sandpaper. Extremely hard (Mohs 9) and sharp, corundum is also usefully brittle, breaking into sharp fragments that keep on cutting.
