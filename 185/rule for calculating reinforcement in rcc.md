This is the reinforcement ratio that will cause "balanced strain condition" which is when these two events occur at the same time: Tension reinforcement yields. Strain in the concrete reaches 0.003. In terms of design, you just want to make sure that your reinforcement ratio is less than this calculated value to prevent brittle failures.

## How To Calculate Steel Quantity For RCC Beam, Column And Slab - DAILY CIVIL
Following are the steps to calculate the quantity of steel for RCC slab. 1. Prepare a bar bending schedule in order to classify different shapes of bars (bent up bar, straight anchor bar, eos bar, curtail bar, etc) and diameters. 2. List down all the shapes of bars from the drawing. 3. Count the number of bars of each of those shapes.
