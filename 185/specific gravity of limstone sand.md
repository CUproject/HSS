The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity, which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water. This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g/cm 3. Therefore, these numbers translate directly to g/cm 3, or tonnes per cubic meter (t/m 3).

Measure the increase in volume caused by the dry solids displacing some of the water. Assume the new volume is 550 c.c. The displacement, then, is 50 c.c. (). Divide the weight of the dry solids (200 gr.) by the difference in volume (50 c.c.). The result, 4.00, is the specific gravity of the dry solids.
