## Gravity Concentration in Artisanal Gold Mining - MDPI
2.1. General Aspects. Many gravity concentration methods used by artisanal miners are discontinuous, i.e., miners stop the process to discharge the concentrate after some time of operation. Some miners have the perception that when they see a yellow concentrate, the gold recovery is good, and the equipment works well.

## Placer Gold Mining | Process & Equipment
Jul 9, 2022The gold particle size of placer gold is small, and the gold particles smaller than 0.1 mm are called floating gold, which is difficult to recover. However, the sludge of the same particle size as the floating gold interferes with the beneficiation process and affects the beneficiation effect, so the sludge under 0.1 mm is generally removed.

Placer gold mining is much easier. The gold is already separated from the rock, and gravity has concentrated the gold into creeks and rivers where it is more easily accessible.
