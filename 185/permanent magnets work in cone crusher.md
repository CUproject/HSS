Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on the concave, material is

The permanent magnet in the loudspeaker is fixed close to a mobile electromagnet coil. The electromagnet is attached to a flexible material called cone (diaphragm). Passing an electric current in the electromagnet causes it to vibrate due to the interaction with the permanent magnet. The cone amplifies these vibrations to produce sound waves.

## how does a magnet work
How a permanent magnet works is all to do with its atomic structure. Ferromagnetic materials, the material that all magnets are made of (metals like iron, nickel and cobalt) have some unpaired electrons in their atoms. These electrons are always spinning and create their own magnetic field, albeit a very weak one.

## What is a permanent magnet? What types are there?
A permanent magnet is a material that can provide magnetic flux when magnetized with an applied magnetic field. Contact to IMA. (+44) 203 318 75 73. contact@imamagnets.  How does a permanent magnet work? Each permanent magnet generates a magnetic field, like any other magnet, which circulates around the magnet in a different pattern.
