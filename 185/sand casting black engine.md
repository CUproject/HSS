Sand cast molds are designed to have a good collapsibility (the casting shrinks while cooling) to avoid defects in the casting, such as hot tearing and cracking. Clay is used to cohesively bond sand particles, giving the sand strength. Common recognizable parts made by sand casting are: engine blocks, cylinder heads, housings and similar

## Sand Casting For Manufacture
Usually sand used to manufacture a mold for the casting process is held together by a mixture of water and clay. A typical mixture by volume could be 89% sand, 4% water, 7% clay. Control of all aspects of the properties of sand is crucial when manufacturing parts by sand casting, therefore a sand laboratory is usually attached to the foundry.

## Sand Casting: Life of a Casting | Reliance Foundry
The basic premise of sand casting. Sand casting can be done into any earthen space that will hold its shape around molten metal. In this video, liquid aluminum is poured into an abandoned fire ant nest. After the metal cools it is unearthed and cleaned, and the resulting casting has captured the shape of the habitat.

In the molding sand method, at least one main contour is represented by bentonite-bound sand. However, this can also involve cavities with undercuts for auxiliary and ancillary equipment, such as a water-pump housing, due to additional cores that were introduced into the bentonite-bound mold. Both casting types can be found in the cast iron area.
