Conveyor Drive Location. The conveyor drive is usually located at the end to which the belt moves so that the drive "pulls" the belt. If the belt movement were reversed, the pulley would be pushing the belt. When the conveyor was fully loaded or when the belt stretched, the pulley could turn and not move the belt.

There's probably a way to have the center of force at the point where the collision occurs which would heighten the realism a bit (that way if the belt touches a corner of the box it rotates the box while propelling it). If you went this route you could then create a model that looks more like a conveyor belt (instead of rollers).
