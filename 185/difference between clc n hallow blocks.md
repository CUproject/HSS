## Concrete Blocks - Manufacturing, Classification & Uses
Hollow concrete blocks. Open and Closed cavity-type hollow concrete blocks are classified into three grades: Grade A - They possess a minimum density of 1500 kg/m³ and are used for load-bearing walls. Grade B - They have a density below 1500 kg/m¬³ and used for load-bearing walls. Grade C - These blocks are used for non-load bearing walls

## Cellular Lightweight Concrete (CLC) Blocks - Happho
Light in Weight: The density of CLC blocks vary from 600 to 800 Kg/cum. This is almost three times less than the traditional clay bricks or flyash brciks. Reduced Construction Cost: The overall dead load of structure is decreased when CLC blocks are used in construction. By optimizing the design accordingly house owners can save money on major construction materials like cement and steel.
