New Zealand's Northland Region is built upon a basement consisting mainly of greywacke rocks, which are exposed on the eastern side of the peninsula. In-place Eocene coal measures crop out at Kamo, near Whangarei, and Oligocene limestone crops out at Hikurangi, near Whangarei..

## Ball clay | Imerys
Ball clays are kaolinitic clays that commonly consist of 20-80% kaolinite, 10-25% mica, 6-65% quartz, as well as organic matter. Ball clay is formed from the weathering and transportation by water of parent rocks. Seams in the same deposit will vary in composition, depending on the quantity of the principal and accessory minerals.

New Zealand has plenty of ordinary grey stones, which come from a hard rock called greywacke. This is what the country's mountain ranges are made of, and you can see it all around the country. So, finding the special gemstones is a matter of searching out places where there are other kinds of rock. The best places to look are rivers and beaches.
