## Fossil fuel power station
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity.Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator.The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating gas engine.

## Coal Processing and Use for Power Generation - ScienceDirect
The use of coal is negatively perceived, since the use of fossil fuels in power generation and other industry sectors contributes significantly to the CO 2 emissions worldwide. Of the main fossil fuels, coal has the lowest H:C ratio, and consequently coal has the highest CO 2 footprint per unit of combustion energy produced.
