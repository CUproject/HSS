## Taconite | Fred Haynes
Until the mid-1900's relatively pure iron ore (either red hematite or black magnetite) could be successfully mined that carried 50-60% iron content. The rocks in BIF typically contain 20-30% iron and it was (and still is) uneconomic to ship ore of that grade to steel mills (Mategko, 2011).

## Magnetite: The Future of Iron Ore - Visual Capitalist
June 18, 2013. By. Jeff Desjardins. Magnetite ore, long the leading source of domestic iron supply in North America, Europe and China, is now increasingly relevant across the globe. The perception that magnetite ore is an inferior substitute to hematite ore is now firmly changing. As easily accessibly, economic hematite deposits become rarer

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

## Magnetite & Lodestone | Mineral Photos, Uses, Properties - Geology
Use of Magnetite as an Ore of Iron. Most of the iron ore mined today is a banded sedimentary rock known as taconite that contains a mixture of magnetite, hematite, and chert. Once considered a waste material, taconite became an important ore after higher grade deposits were depleted. Today's commercial taconites contain 25 to 30% iron by weight.

How The Two Can Be Confused. Hematite is an iron oxide with the chemical formula Fe2O3; magnetite is also an iron oxide but with the chemical formula Fe3O4. Another important difference between hematite and magnetite is that hematite appears in a variety of colors, but magnetite is only black in color. Hematite makes a rust or blood-red colored

Magnetite is a black, opaque, magnetic mineral that leaves a black streak when rubbed across a hard rough surface. It is one of the most abundant metal oxides, and its crystal structure contains both the ferrous (Fe+2) and ferric (Fe+3) forms of iron ions. A complex pattern of electrons between the two forms of iron is the source of its
