These are split into two main types: horizontal shaft impactors (HSI) and vertical shaft impactors (VSI). HSI crushers are limited to soft materials only, so aren't well suited to concrete and are better for soft sedimentary rocks. VSI crushers work differently.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Crusher, Crushing plant - All industrial manufacturers - DirectIndustry
A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.
