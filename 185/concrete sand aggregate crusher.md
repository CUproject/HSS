What is sand aggregate? Sand aggregate is a general term for sand, gravel and other materials in construction projects. It is the main building material for concrete and stone masonry in hydraulic engineering, and it acts as skeleton or filling in concrete. It is widely used in civil engineering such as cement concrete, asphalt concrete, road foundation, railway track slag, and mortar.

Use this paver sand calculator to solve for the amount of sand you need to create a stable layer under a pavement. Whether you're planning to build an elaborate patio or a paved driveway, you must first create a strong foundation to lay your concrete or stone pavers on. This layer which supports these elements directly is usually paving sand .

## What is the Difference Between A Gravel and B Gravel?
B Gravel: While B gravel is also mixed with sand on most occasions, the size of the rocks or crushed stone that accompany B gravel can vary, sometimes depending upon the purpose that B gravel will be fulfilling. Usually reserved for major roadways or parkways and industrial building, B gravel is meant to stand up to more frequent and heavier use.
