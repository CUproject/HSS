Quartzite is use for making bricks and other strong building materials. It is also growing in popularity as a decorative stone, and has a limited use as crushed stone. As it is so hard, quartzite is not quarried as much as softer stone, and tends to be taken from the surface rather than underground. Quartzite is also quite dense and extremely hard.

Quartzite: Metamorphic Rock - Pictures, Definition More. Quartzite has been used by humans to make stone tools for over one million years.

## What metal is for countertops?
Faux quartz is a less expensive alternative to natural quartz. It is made of man-made materials such as concrete, polymer resins, and glass. Faux quartz often has a simulated stone or granite appearance. Can I use sheet metal as a countertop? You can, but it's not recommended because it's not very strong and could dent easily.
