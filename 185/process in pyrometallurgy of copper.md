## The difference between hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy - TES-AMM
Jul 18, 2022While hydrometallurgy involves using water for the extraction of metals, pyrometallurgy is a heat-based extraction and purification process. As with the water-based process, pyrometallurgy generally involves three steps: Roasting: This refers to the heating of compounds in air and transforming sulfide ores into oxides, creating gas.

## Pyrometallurgy
Pyrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy is a branch of extractive metallurgy. It consists of the thermal treatment of minerals and metallurgical ores and concentrates to bring about physical and chemical transformations in the materials to enable recovery of valuable metals. Pyrometallurgical treatment may produce saleable products such as pure metals

## Valuable Metals Are Removed From Ores During What Process
Mar 6, 2022Valuable Metals Are Removed From Ores During What Process? Extractive metallurgy is the practice of removing valuable metals from an ore and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. Hydrometallurgy uses aqueous solutions to extract metals from ores ( leaching ).

Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Pyrometallurgy
Pyrometallurgical processes are generally grouped into one or more of the following categories: [3] calcining, roasting, smelting, refining. Most pyrometallurgical processes require energy input to sustain the temperature at which the process takes place. The energy is usually provided in the form of combustion or from electrical heat.

## Difference Between Hydrometallurgy and Pyrometallurgy
Smelting is a thermal process in which at last one product is in the molten state. Then the metal oxides are smelted by heating along with coke (or charcoal), which allows releasing carbon dioxide. This leaves the refined mineral. Refining is the removal of impurities from the ore using thermal processes.
