## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced. Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed

5.1 Introduction. Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.
