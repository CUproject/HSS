## The working principle and performance of impact crusher
Impact crusher is a kind of equipment that uses impact energy to crush materials. When the machine is working, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at a high speed. It is thrown to the counterattack equipment to be broken again, and then bounced from the counterattack liner to the action of the blow hammer to be crushed again.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - StudiousGuy
A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The movement of the jaw crusher is
