Significant details include the weight, size, and type of the products being conveyed. Weight: The weight of the product is one of the important considerations while selecting an appropriate belt because heavy materials can bend or wrap the belt. To keep the system running properly you will need to determine the weight of your product.

## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
Jan 26, 2021The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.
