## Design and Fabrication of Mini Surface Grinding Machine
grinding are the material of the grinding wheel and the material of the piece being worked on. Typical work piece materials include cast iron and mild steel. These two materials don't tend to clog the grinding wheel while being processed. Other materials are aluminium, stainless steel, brass and some plastics.

## Grinding Machine: Definition, Types, Parts, Working & Operations (With PDF)
A grinding machine or grinder is an industrial power tool that uses an abrasive wheel for cutting or removing the m aterial. It is a process of metal cutting by using a rotating abrasive whee l from the surface of the workpiece. Generally, the grinding is finishing operation to show the high surface quality, accuracy of the shape and dimension.

## The effect of uncut chip thickness on edge chipping and wheel 
The magnitude of edge chipping is shown to steadily increase with increasing CDR, indicating increasing brittle behaviour of the material removal process as the uncut chip thickness increases. By using grinding ratio to correlate with wheel performance, it is shown that the grinding ratio first increases with increasing CDR, and reaches a peak

The simulator was used to calculate the number of active grains, uncut chip thickness, and contact length for a stochastic wheel model of Radiac Abrasive's WRA-60-J5-V1 grinding wheel. These values were then mapped to every grain on the grinding wheel and used to determine the instantaneous material removal rate of the wheel and workpiece

## Uncut Thickness Of The Grinding Machine
In this example a 50 mm diameter BK7 testpiece was ground on a 5 axis Edgetek grinding machine using a resin bond diamond grinding wheel. The workpiece was rotated at 5.5 rpm and the grinding wheel traversed from the outer edge to the centre. Thus the chip thickness varied from a maximum value at the outer edge to a minimum value at the centre.

##  Machining vs. Grinding
High Speed Peel Grinding Advantages of HSP over Conventional Grinding • High speed (up to 200 m/sec) for high efficiency; • High material removal rate (up to 100 mm3/mm/s); • Reduced grinding forces (less critical to machine stiffness); • Reduced area of contact with the workpiece; • Easier coolant delivery to the grinding zone;
