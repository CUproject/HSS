Apr 11, 2022The typical mechanical inching drive motor speed is around 1500 to 1800 RPM while the mill inching speed is in the order of 0.1 to 0.15 RPM. Thus, the gear reduction ratio between the inching drive motor and the mill is roughly 12,000 to 1. What this means is that the inching drive motor must turn 12,000 times to be able to turn the mill once.
