## How much is ground penetrating radar?rin
How far down can ground penetrating radar go? GPR can reach depths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) in low conductivity materials such as dry sand or granite. Moist clays, shale, and other high conductivity materials, may attenuate or absorb GPR signals, greatly decreasing the depth of penetration to 3 feet (1 meter) or less.

## Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) | Open Ground
Introduction. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic technique in which electromagnetic waves are emitted into the ground surface which reflects from structures/targets with different dielectrical properties. GPR is similar to seismic reflection with an electromagnetic pulse being used instead of a pulse of seismic energy.

## Ground Penetrating Radar | HGI - hydroGEOPHYSICS
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a high resolution technique that is designed primarily to image shallow soil and ground structures using electromagnetic (EM) waves, typically in the frequency band of MHz. GPR is an electromagnetic pulse reflection method based on physical principles to those of shallow seismic reflection surveys. The method has been increasingly [.]
