Since 1970, NIOSH has compiled data on the prevalence of CWP in underground coal miners. The graph shows a summary of this data. In the early 1970s, the prevalence of CWP was 33% among miners working 25 or more years. The prevalence dropped to less than 5% by the late 1990s. However, since that time, CWP prevalence has increased to more than 10
