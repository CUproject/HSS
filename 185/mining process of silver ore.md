## Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron
Iron Mining Process. From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces.  The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism

## Patio process
The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.
