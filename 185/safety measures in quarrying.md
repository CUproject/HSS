## Key performance indicators for health safety and environmnent - Sitemate
The actual measure of performance here is at the very least the number of accidents or incidents. But this number is usually converted into a standard ration of 'X accidents per employee'. This way, a company or project can easily measure itself against other project and benchmarks - no matter the size of the project or operation.

## Mining safely - innovative technologies to prevent mining accidents
Rock and roof falls is one of the most common cause of underground mining accidents. The basic precautionary measures to prevent such accidents are taken during the preparation of mining layout designs with the aim of minimising the effects of potential geologic hazards. Constant monitoring of rock faces is required to prevent such accidents.
