## Filtration Systems
Filtration station is the heart of a micro irrigation system. No matter how clean the input water is, a filter is an insurance to guard against debris entering the irrigation system. Even small particles in the water can cause drip emitters to become choked. The types of filters generally used are: Hydrocyclone / Sand Separator, Media filter

## Sand Media Filters - Maintenance of Microirrigation Systems
A sand media filter consists of tanks filled with silica sand or crushed granite. Contaminants are filtered from the water as it flows through the filtering media (fig. 11). Multiple tanks of sand media are used to obtain sufficient filtration at the design flow rate of the irrigation system.

## sand cleaner filter construction
Industrial Sand Filters | Multi Media Filters | Water  H2K industrial sand filters are designed to remove larger suspended solids (50-100 microns), using a single size of filtration media. The coarseness of the filtration process can be determined by adjusting the size of the filter sand. The effective size of each granule of sand typically
