## Electrical discharge machining
Electrical discharge machining (EDM), also known as spark machining, spark eroding, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a metal fabrication process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks). Material is removed from the work piece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject

## How to Use a Surface Grinder Machine - American Machine Tools
A surface grinding machine is used to produce a smooth accurate finish on either metallic or nonmetallic materials. It uses a round rotating abrasive grinding wheel that remains stationary (but rotating) while the feed table (with work attached) is run in a reciprocating motion (left and right) under the grinding wheel.

## 7 Different Types of Grinding Machines and Their Uses
Nov 19, 2021For example, when using a cylindrical grinder, the workpiece and grinding wheels rotate simultaneously whether the shape is cylindrical, ellipse, or even a crankshaft. With such versatility, you can carry out five types of grinding work on objects. Which are outside diameter grinding, inside diameter grinding, plunge grinding, creep feed

## TYPES OF GRINDING MACHINES - Cad cam Engineering WorldWide
The versatility and wide application of the grinding processes have led to the development of many types of grinding machines. Your shop will probably have two, three, or more of the common types.  Centerless grinding is also suited to the grinding of conical parts (Figure L-19) and parts with different diameters (Figure L-20). It is even
