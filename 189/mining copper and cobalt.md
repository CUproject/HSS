## The Best 5 Sources of Mining Cobalt
Mining cobalt starts with extracting copper, nickel, or iron from their ores. The ore is then smelted to extract the metal. The metal is then purified and extracted from the ore using electrolysis. The electrolysis process consists of a cathode and an anode. The cathode is made of pure metal, and the anode is made of graphite.
