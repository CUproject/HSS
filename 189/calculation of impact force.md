## Energy of falling object - GSU
Note that the above calculation of impact force is accurate only if the height h includes the stopping distance, since the process of penetration is further decreasing its gravitational potential energy.. The average impact force calculated here is the average over distance, which can be presumed to be proportional to, but not the same as, the average over time.

## Is impact a force?aroni
What are the 3 forces of impact? Speed, weight, and time between impact and stopping all affect force of impact. A driver has control over the speed. What do mean by impact force? Impact force is a force that delivers a shock or high impact in a relatively short period of time.It occurs when two entities collide.
