## Effects of Slime on Lead-Zinc Oxide Flotation and Solutions
Jul 9, 2021Lead-zinc ore is the important non-ferrous metal, which is widely used in the construction of national economy. As lead-zinc oxide ore is easy to be slime, which will seriously affect the flotation effect, lead-zinc sulfide ore is often chosen in the many lead-zinc processing plants. However, with the depletion of lead-zinc sulfide resources

## A review of zinc oxide mineral beneficiation using flotation method 
The flotation of zinc oxide minerals is suggested for sulfidization of the smithsonite followed by activation with CuSO 4 and flotation of the activated zinc oxide using xanthate at pH 10.5 . It is also implied that after pretreatment of the pulp with sulfidizer followed by reconditioning with CuSO 4, zinc oxide flotation can be achieved with

Sep 9, 2020Flotation process of lead-zinc oxide ore. ; 1,465 Views; icon 1; Flotation process of lead-zinc oxide ore . The reason why lead-zinc oxide ore is difficult to select is mainly caused by the following two reasons: First, the composition of lead-zinc oxide ore is relatively complicated, including a large amount of soluble salts such as gypsum, copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, and carbonate
