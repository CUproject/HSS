Recycled concrete can be used in many of the same ways as you would use new materials, such as gravel, paving materials, and aggregates. Permeable paving for walkways, driveways, and other outdoor hard surfaces: Broken concrete that is carefully laid creates a stable, porous traffic surface that rainwater can filter through.

History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

What is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways, pathways, garden beds and more.. When any concrete structure, road, sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed, that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.
