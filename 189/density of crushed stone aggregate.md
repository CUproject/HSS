## How to determine the density of the gravel kg / m3 - Home Renovates
The density of any material, including gravel, depends on what breed of it is produced. For example, 1 m3 granite rock weighs 2.6 tonnes and dense limestone - 2.9 tons / m3 (depending on the number of quartz impurities and other minerals). Between the stones (gravel) there are air spaces.

## Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. Note, kg/cu.m divided by 16.02 = lbs/cu.ft.

## Bulk density of crushed stone/bsn
The density of crushed stone 20/40 is in the range of kg / m 3. Stones 40/70 are similar to the previous ones - kg / m 3. It is difficult to confuse granite crushed stone with other types: stones are characteristic from dark gray to pinkish, shades are caused by the inclusion of different minerals in the base rock.

Coarse aggregates consist of gravel, crushed stone or recycled concrete with particle sizes of ranging from 3/8-inch to 1.5 inches. Coarse aggregates are used in a wide range of construction applications, notably in concrete and asphalt mixes. Common uses for coarse crushed stone. • Concrete aggregate.

The quality of granite is judged from how far the resulting value of the density of crushed stone is from the density of granite - 2.7 g / cm3 (or 2.7 kg / dm3). Too different from the "granite" value of the absolute density suggests that the crushed stone is not made of granite at all, but, say, basalt or, in general, secondary.

## Aggregates - Lafarge
Our Aggregates. Aggregates refer to fragments of rock, sand, and gravel. They are obtained through surface mining, or quarrying, where large rock formations are drilled, blasted, and processed into smaller rocks and sand. Aggregates are an essential component in a wide range of concrete applications, and Lafarge South Africa offers a wide range
