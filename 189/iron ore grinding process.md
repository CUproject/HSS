## grinding ore process
21/03/2015Â· The process of enriching taconite ore involved grinding the ore to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore i.e., an ore beneficiation process. The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles, as small as 0.1 mm or less, which are not suitable for sintering. This issue led to the development of the pelletizing process.

## Process flow sheet for Pelletization using wet grinding process
Around 8-10 million tons of slimes are discarded during the washing process in India, containing about 48-60% of Fe every year (Prakash et al., 2000), almost 15% of the total ore mined.
