## grinding ore process
21/03/2015· The process of enriching taconite ore involved grinding the ore to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore i.e., an ore beneficiation process. The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles, as small as 0.1 mm or less, which are not suitable for sintering. This issue led to the development of the pelletizing process.
