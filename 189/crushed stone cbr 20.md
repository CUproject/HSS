CBR is a value, not a percentage. It does not correlate well to a bearing capacity other than in a gross classification sense. Well, strictly speaking, it is a percentage. You're comparing the resistance of a given material to the resistance of an ideal crushed stone that will support 1,000 psi at 0.1 inch deflection.

## California Bearing Ratio - Pavement Interactive
The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is a simple strength test that compares the bearing capacity of a material with that of a well-graded crushed stone (thus, a high quality crushed stone material should have a CBR @ 100%).It is primarily intended for, but not limited to, evaluating the strength of cohesive materials having maximum particle sizes less than 19 mm (0.75 in.) (AASHTO, 2000 [1]).

## Blending of recycled glass and crushed rock in road pavements
The higher CBR value of the crushed rock source can be also attributed to its lower LA abrasion value.  The compaction curves presented in Figure 3 are generally flatter than the compaction curve of excavation stone crushed rock.  Construction and Building Materials 2006; Vol 20: . Standards Australia.
