## Fulling
Fulling, also known as tucking or walking ( Scots: waukin, hence often spelled waulking in Scottish English ), is a step in woollen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth (particularly wool) to eliminate oils, dirt, and other impurities, and to make it thicker. The practice died out with the modernisation of the industrial revolution.
