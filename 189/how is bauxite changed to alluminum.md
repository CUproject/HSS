## how is bauxite changed to aluminum
Bauxite is a high-aluminum-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.
