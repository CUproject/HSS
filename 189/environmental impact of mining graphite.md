Jun 29, 2020"The environmental impacts of graphite mining are very similar to those associated with cobalt mining," the report adds. Last December, a prominent professor at the Copenhagen Business School said that attempts to rein in global warming by driving electric cars were nothing other than "pointless virtue signaling.

## Concerns of the Graphite Mining - Essay Example - Studentshare
Social and Environmental Concerns of Graphite Mining: The mining process of Graphite requires power operations at the mining locations. The construction, decommissioning and operations of these power generators have potential environmental impacts. For example, Ontario Graphite Limited closed its mining project due to these environmental issues

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Mining remains an essential and growing part of the modern industry. By some estimates, it makes up nearly 45% of the total global economy, and mineral production continues to increase as demand for raw materials grows around the world.. However, many mining techniques still in use can have serious impacts on both the mining site itself and the surrounding environment.

Therefore, there is an environmental concern that is integral to the mining process. This sheet form of mica is less abundant than flake mica, and labour-intensive in its extraction. Mining for scrap or flake mica is less economically or environmentally risky, while being essentially a by-product of the sheet mica mining industry.
