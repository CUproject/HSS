## Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
11.5.3.1 Beneficiation. Mineral beneficiation begins with crushing and grinding of mined ore for near-complete separation of ore and gangue minerals as well as between ore minerals. Each processing step is designed to increase the grade (concentration) of the valuable components of the original ore.

Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.
