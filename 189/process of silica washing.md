How is silica gel made? It is generally prepared by acidification of a solution of a silicate, such as water glass; the resulting silicic acid forms either a rigid mass or a gelatinous precipitate from which soluble materials are removed by washing with water. The water is finally removed by heating, leaving a glassy, granular solid.
