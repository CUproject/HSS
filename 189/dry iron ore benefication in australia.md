## Dry Magnetite Ore Beneficiation Process Diagram
Usa Process For Beneficiating Magnetite. A process for upgrading lowgrade magnetitecontaining iron ore with minimum fine grinding. the dry ore is first comminuted to between about threefourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. the dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.
