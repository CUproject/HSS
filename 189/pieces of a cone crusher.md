Cone crushers are a compression machine that reduces materials by compressing/squeezing the material between moving and stationary elements. Our used cone crushers are able to be used as primary or secondary crushers and are employed in order to compress the feed material between two pieces of steel, this process reduces the size considerably.

Replace the oil pan and thrust plate. 2. Oil temperature and oil pressure rise. The oil pressure in the thin oil lubrication system of the cone crusher increases and the oil return temperature also rises accordingly. The reason. The oil pipe or the oil groove in the crusher parts is blocked, and the safety valve fails.

As the feed moves towards the drive end of the cone crusher, its size decreases (due to the crushing action), and ever smaller pieces move towards the drive end of the crusher. After passing through the crusher, the product -now at a much-reduced size- is discharged through an opening in the bottom shell.
