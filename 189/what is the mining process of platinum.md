## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## Platinum Mining - Extraction & Refinement | BullionByPost
Platinum mines Most of the world's platinum mines are found in South Africa, accounting for about 80% of all platinum production. Other platinum mines are primarily located in Russia and Canada. The mining and refining of platinum is very labour intensive and expensive, causing many mines to close down or significantly reduce production.

The all-in sustaining costs are about $1,110, while the platinum price is about $754 per ounce (as of September 2018). It means that it is importantly below the production costs. It implies that platinum mining is unprofitable right now. Obviously, such a situation can't go on indefinitely. The investment implication is to avoid investing in

The first step in this process is to crush platinum containing ore and immerse it in the reagent containing water; a process known as 'froth flotation'. During flotation, air is pumped through the ore-water slurry. Platinum particles chemically attach on to the oxygen and rise to the surface in a froth that is skimmed off for further refining.
