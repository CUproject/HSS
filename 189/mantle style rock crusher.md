Particularly formed telescopically mating conical elements (mantle and bowl) are disclosed for use in a cone type gyratory crusher as employed for reducing hard rock ore. Each of the conical elements includes a substantial crushing section of essentially linear taper, which has a hard metal surface layer (over 12 percent chromium and over 2.5 percent carbon) of at least 7/16-inch thickness.

A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

## Bowl Liner & Mantle | Wear Resistant Crusher Parts | GTEK
Cone crushers are widely used in the mining and aggregates industries to reduce the size of blasted rock by compressing the material between two manganese liners: mantle and bowl liner. The mantle covers the cone head to protect it from wear, we can see it as a sacrificial wear liner that sits on the cone head.
