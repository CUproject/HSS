## Purpose of Gravel on a Flat Roof - CivilJungle
Purpose of Gravel on a Flat Roof. The usage of a ballasted commercial roofing system is primarily motivated by two factors: Because of the weight given by the gravel, the roof materials are anchored to the decking with much fewer fasteners. Using a specially designed screw and plate fastening arrangement, the gravel may be put in a lot less time.

## Why Put Gravel on a Flat Roof - The Purpose of Gravel on Rooftops - IKO
Gravel is used on flat roofs for two reasons: To protect the underlying layer of roofing materials, as is the case with built-up roofs (BURs). To weigh down or secure the roofing material, as is the case with single-ply flat roofs. There are different types and weights of gravel used on flat roofs for these purposes.

It is not uncommon for this percentage to be 85% to 100%. If the installation power factor is below this required percentage, the utility billing is then based on the KVA Demand times the required power factor percentage instead of billing by Kilowatt Demand. The difference between the two billings is known as the power factor penalty charge.
