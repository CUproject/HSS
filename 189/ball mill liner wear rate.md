## Rubber Ball Mill Liner Wear Rate Estimation - Grinding & Classification 
Secondary Grinding Ball Mills experience 1-2 years of liner life, depending on tonnage/ball size. Normally Lifter to Plate ratio is 1:2.Tertiary Grinding Ball Mills experience up to 4 years of liner life. Since, all the mills are unique in their operation and the practical sense in which they run, we do wear measurement during every shutdown.
