## Construction Wastes: Types, Causes, and Recycling Strategies
Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.

## Construction Waste Recycling - Sustainable Sources LLC
DEFINITION: Construction waste recycling is the separation and recycling of recoverable waste materials generated during construction and remodeling. Packaging, new material scraps and old materials and debris all constitute potentially recoverable materials. In renovation, appliances, masonry materials, doors and windows are recyclable.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## How the Construction Industry Can Better Use Recycled Building Materials
Oct 25, 2021Recycling building materials can pose challenges depending on the material. Fortunately, steel, glass and gypsum board are all highly recyclable. Almost all (98%) structural steel will avoid landfill, whereas around 70% of rebar used to reinforce concrete will be recycled. Careful separation can increase this efficiency.

Jul 26, 2022Barn Wood. Barn wood is a popular recycled material in the US. Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, barns were build using a mix of lumber (usually what's found on the owner's land). Most of these old buildings are now being torn down and what's left usable is a cheap building material for new constructions.
