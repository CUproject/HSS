## What is Ball Milling Process? - ball mills supplier
The ball milling process is generally divided into two types, the dry ball milling process, and the wet ball milling process. This article takes dry ball milling as an example to introduce the ball milling process. First, select the appropriate size and weight of the grinding medium according to the particle size of the grinding material.
