The grooves are constructed to a width of between 0.116 to 0.080 inch and spaced approximately 3/4 inch on centers. The depth of grooves is in the range of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Another texture is that developed by diamond grinding of Portland cement concrete pavements. Grinding is done to bring the pavement back to new-pavement smoothness tolerance.
