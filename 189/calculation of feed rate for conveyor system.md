Teus Tuinenburg. First of all, a belt conveyor is a volume transporting device. The rate is calculated as : Volume = cross-section x velocity. The conveyed mass is then known by multiplying the volume rate by the density. You can change the spreadsheet calculation, where the only factor is mass flow.

## Screw Conveyor Horsepower | Engineering Guide - KWS Manufacturing
Horsepower is defined as the power required to safely and feasibly convey a bulk material a fixed distance in a screw conveyor. The horsepower required to drive a screw conveyor is called Total Shaft Horsepower, or TSHP. TSHP is a function of the characteristics of the bulk material being conveyed and the friction inherent in the screw conveyor

## Feed Rate Calculator - Daycounter
Feed Rate Calculator. When milling or drilling, or creating a tool path for a CNC machine the feed rate must be determined. Materials have rated surface speeds for a given type of cutter. The harder the material the slower the speed. Given the diameter of the tool and the surface speed, the RPMs of the spindle can be calculated.

## Screw Feeders - Kase Conveyors
Normally short in length, Screw Feeders are designed to regulate the volumetric rate of material flow from a hopper, bin or storage unit. The inlet is usually flooded with material (100% load capacity) but by incorporating changes in the construction of the flighting (diameter, pitch, etc.) and the speed of the feeder screw, the material discharge can be governed to the desired rate.
