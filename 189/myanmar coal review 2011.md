Myanmar coal mining. Increasingly, the world is moving to the use of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind and hydro power) rather than relying on fossil fuels such as coal and oil. The main reason for this is that renewable energy is cleaner than fossil fuels (which can cause pollution when used).

14 May 2015. Myanmar may need to compete for supplies as region turns to coal. The Myanmar government's approval of a Thai-Japanese consortium's plan to build a large US$2.8 billion coal-fired power station in Myanmar's southeast Mon State underlines a trend across the region to opt for the polluting fossil fuels to generate electricity.

## Myanmar continues coal-fired power plant plans
Approved in 2002, the 120-megwatt Tigyit plant is Myanmar's first coal-fired power plant. Detractors of coal-fired plants have noted that while coal remains a major source of feedstock for power plants, its use has gradually fallen. They have pointed out that Myanmar should leverage on its abundant hydropower sources instead of using coal.
