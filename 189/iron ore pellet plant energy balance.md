## Australia's Central Eyre magnetite plans pellet plant - Argus Media
Jan 12, 2022Australian mining company Iron Road has included a 1mn-2mn t/yr iron ore pellet plant as part of its proposed 12mn t/yr Central Eyre magnetite project in South Australia. The combination production capacity will remain at 12mn t/yr, with the volume of magnetite to be determined by the final design capacity of the pellet plant.

Jun 7, 2022Other projects such as Voestalpine's HYFOR are designed for direct reduction of iron ores without pelletization, and using hydrogen only, which may ease difficulties in securing pellets. Pelletizing iron ore uses energy at the pellet plant, and the more concentrated the ore feedstock the greater the need for beneficiation, grinding and sorting

In this route of iron making, the use of noncoking coal or natural gas is made as reductant for iron ore. The oil is used for heat hardening of iron ore pellets which is generally exploited by gas-based DRI plants. The coal-based DRI units generally require lump ore which need some electrical energy during crushing and sizing operations.

## Gas Fired Iron Ore Pelletizing Kiln
Jan 6, 2021The iron oxide pelletizing industry is very energy intensive and relies heavily on natural gas to fire pellet-indurating furnaces. Approximately 75 million long tons of iron oxide pellets are produced in the United States each year, requiring a fuel input of about 55 billion ft³ of natural gas. During the past several years the industry has
