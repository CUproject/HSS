## Coal- & coke-fired power plant equipment | Schenck Process
Our gravimetric feeders compensate for the variation in bulk density and feed a fixed weight of coal in response to a boiler fuel demand. Gravimetric feeders have become the industry standard in coal fired power plants, reducing fuel costs through improved boiler efficiency, shortening downtimes, and reducing NOx emissions.

A coal fired power plant is the most inefficient source of energy; it is costly and environmentally hazardous. This is how it works: Firstly the coal is dig from the mines and is supplied to the location where the coal-fired power plant is set up. This supply is made through a highway truck, railways or a barge.

## Coal-fired power generation | Sulzer
Coal- and oil-fired process. Coal- and oil-fired steam power plants have steam turbines to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electric generator. All plants use the steam turbine for the drop between the high pressure and temperature of the steam and the lower pressure of condensing vapor.
