## 3 Types of Crushers - Optimum Crush
Nov 12, 2021Jaw crushes have a moving and a fixed jaw, with the moving and fixed jaw coming together to press the material down to break it into smaller sizes. There are two kinds of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. The single toggle jaw crusher uses a Shaft rotation for a compressive action. The double toggle crusher has two shafts toggle

A Gyratory Cone Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory cone crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory cone crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing
