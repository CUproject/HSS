## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2-0.5 Âµm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach. For large gold particles and nuggets, this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant. Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.

Carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks, which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant, and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously.

The well-known carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold recovery processes are fairly robust. Considering the constantly changing characteristics of run-of-mine (ROM) ore, a robust process is in general a great advantage for a mineral processing plant.
