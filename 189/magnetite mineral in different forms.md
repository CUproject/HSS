Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world. Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.

Magnetite is a mineral whose primary component is an iron oxide that contains equal amounts of iron (II) and iron (III). Its empirical formula is Fe 3 O 4, and it is often expressed as iron (II,III) oxide. In the past, it has been called ferrous-ferric oxide and triiron tetraoxide.

Hardness (H) is the resistance of a mineral to scratching. It is a property by which minerals may be described relative to a standard scale of 10 minerals known as the Mohs scale of hardness. The degree of hardness is determined by observing the comparative ease or difficulty with which one mineral is scratched by another or by a steel tool. For measuring the hardness of a mineral, several

## How Do Most Silicate Materials Form? - Realonomics
Answer: The silicate minerals are the most important mineral class because they are by far the most abundant rock-forming minerals. This group is based on the silica (SiO4) tetrahedron structure in which a silicon atom is covalently bonded to 4 oxygen atoms at the corners of a triangular pyramid shape.

## Magnetite - Assignment Point
Magnetite is a brown to black mineral that is strongly magnetic. It crystallizes in the cubic system and commonly occurs as small octahedrons. Magnetite occurs in many different types of rock and is an important source of iron. Its chemical formula Fe 3 O 4, and it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is very easy to identify.
