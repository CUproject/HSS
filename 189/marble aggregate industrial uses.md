## Use of waste marble aggregates in concrete
Today we are faced with an important consumption and a growing need for aggregates because of the growth in industrial production, this situation has led to a fast decrease of available resources. On the other hand, a high volume of marble production has generated a considerable amount of waste materials; almost 70% of this mineral gets wasted in the mining, processing and polishing stages
