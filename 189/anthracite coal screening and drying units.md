## Anthracite Coal - IspatGuru
Anthracite coal normally occurs in old geological formations which have spent the longest time underground. It is the rarest and most mature coal which accounts for only around 1 % of the world's total coal reserves. The major reserves of the anthracite coal are located mainly in China, Vietnam, North Korea, Russia, Ukraine, and USA.

More coal operators are discovering the benefits of dry screening with units such as the bivi-Tec (seen above). If run-of-mine coal is difficult to screen, waste coal (gob, culm) is downright nasty. Today, a mixture of coal, silt, clay and soil, typical waste clay is reprocessed from abandoned settling ponds at closed mines.
