C + O2 → CO2. The heat produced by this reaction is the main source of heat in the blast furnace that is used for iron production. At the bottom of the furnace, the temperature is very high, which causes more of the coke to react with carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide. C + CO2 → 2CO. The carbon monoxide then becomes the "reducing

Answer (1 of 3): Naturally-occuring iron ore varies in it's content. Also, you haven't said whether it is "benefacted ore" (crushed, with gangue material removed), or straight out of the ground. Obviously, if the latter is the case, even very rich ores seldom contain better than a few percent of

## For the extraction of iron haematite ore is used?
For the extraction of iron, haematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is used.  To make steel, iron ore is first mined from the ground. It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added. In fact, a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon, usually less than 1%."

## Bog iron
Bog iron is a form of impure iron deposit that develops in bogs or swamps by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of iron carried in solution. In general, bog ores consist primarily of iron oxyhydroxides, commonly goethite (FeO(OH)).. Iron-bearing groundwater typically emerges as a spring and the iron in it forms ferric hydroxide upon encountering the oxidizing environment of the surface.

Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

Jun 23, 2022Extraction of metals. The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

The ore proper is separated by crushing the raw ore are simply washing away the lighter soil. . There a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and a good supply of oxygen.

Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.
