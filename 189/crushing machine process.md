## Polymers | Free Full-Text | Crushing Characteristics Comparison between 
When the crushing failure process was relatively stable, the specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of the 2/1 hybrid tubes were not affected by the geometric size. The energy absorption of the hybrid tubes was higher than the sum of the energy absorption of all the corresponding individual tubes, showing a positive hybrid effect.
