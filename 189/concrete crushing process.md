## Concrete recycling
Concrete recycling is the use of rubble from demolished concrete structures. Recycling is cheaper and more ecological than trucking rubble to a landfill. Crushed rubble can be used for road gravel, revetments, retaining walls, landscaping gravel, or raw material for new concrete.Large pieces can be used as bricks or slabs, or incorporated with new concrete into structures, a material called

## Removing reinforced steel from concrete - Quarry
Concrete generally has reinforcing steel rods embedded in it and during the crushing process the steel is broken into short lengths with very sharp points. The steel has to be removed before the concrete can be reused and the most efficient method of recovering the steel is through magnetic separators. Below is an outline of the magnetic

## Ergeon - What is the Concrete Curing Process?
Curing is the process of controlling the rate and extent of moisture loss from concrete during cement hydration. It may be either after it has been placed in position (or during the manufacture of concrete products), thereby providing time for the hydration of the cement to occur. Since the hydration of cement takes time - days, and even

The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.
