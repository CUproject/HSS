## Rock Crushing Theory and Formula using Kick & Rittinger's Law
Rittinger's theory and law of the energy expended in crushing of rock is that the work of crushing is proportional to the reduction in diameter; or, as I have more fully expressed it: "The work done in crushing is proportional to the surface exposed by the operation; or, better expressed for this purpose, the work done on a given mass of rock is proportional to the reciprocal of the

Gyratory Crusher. A gyratory crusher consists of a concave surface and a conical head constructed from heavy steel casting. It works by using a mantle that gyrates within a concave bowl. This rock crushing equipment uses compressive force to fracture the rock and this happens when the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration.

## Rock Crushers for Commercial Gold Mining Operations
The major types of crushers available for mining operations include: 1. Jaw Crusher. This type of rock crusher employs the compressive force to break up larger rocks into smaller pieces. The crusher has two vertical jaws; a fixed jaw and a swing jaw. The rocks to be crushed are filled into the crushing chamber (the gap between the two jaws) and

## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Rock crusher. Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.

The room-and-pillar involves extracting the rock by carving a series of rooms while leaving pillars of rock to support the mine roof. When mining reaches the end of a section of deposit called a panel, the direction of mining is generally reversed (called the "retreat") in an attempt to recover as much of the rock from the pillars as possible.

First, the material enters the feed opening along with the high-speed rotating roller drums, then it got crushed by strong compressive forces in the crushing chamber, and ultimately being discharged until its size smaller than the gap between two drums.
