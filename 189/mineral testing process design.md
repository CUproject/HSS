Mineral beneficiation is a process of concentrating valuable constituents of an ore by using a physical separation process. It's one of the initial steps of extractive metallurgy with the main purpose being to prepare ore for downstream purification processes. The most common mineral beneficiation processes are sample preparation, comminution

In its natural state, chlorite schist tends to soften and decompose when it contacts water. In the process of excavation, the surrounding rock is prone to block falling and small-scale collapse.
