A Level Surface. Adding crushed stone under your concrete slab will provide a level surface for your foundation. Simply pouring concrete onto the ground will expose it to elemental erosion that will cause cracking and sinking. Similarly, if there are roots or plants under your slab, they may rot and cause unevenness.

## Use of Crushed Stone sand & its impact on Concrete Performance
The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete.

## Crushed Stone Sand Analysis For Concrete
Aug 28, 2020 While sand is the usual common aggregate managed to create concrete, you can also mix cement by gravel, crushed stone, or even parts of old concrete. The quantity of water you mix in order depends on the aggregate substance, but you'll want somewhere within 15 to 20 per cent of water.

Feb 01, 2012 The natural river sand in concrete is replaced with crushed stone fine aggregate passing through 4.75 mm I.S sieve in 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by weight of sand. For each percentage replacement of fine aggregate, notch-to-depth ratios of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 are considered for the DCN specimens. A water cement ratio of 0.5 is adopted

## 3 Reasons to Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs - B & R Sand & Gravel
1. Help Level the Ground. Starting the installation process with a layer of crushed stone helps level the ground and gives you an even surface to work on. Pouring concrete without a firm stone base will cause it to crack and erode over time. The stone layer also helps create a barrier between the slabs and the surrounding plant growth.

Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.

The sand which is used in mortar can be natural sand, or crushed stone sand or crushed gravel sand.

## Aggregate Base Course | Acme Sand & Gravel
Aggregate Base is used as the base course under asphalt pavement roadways, under concrete slabs and structural foundations, and as backfill material for underground pipelines and other underground utilities within a roadway. It is placed by means of attentive spreading and compacting to a minimum of 95% relative compaction, providing the stable
