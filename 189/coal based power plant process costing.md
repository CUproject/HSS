Coal trader's web sites give base prices in the international market. We take a coal price of around 65 $ / Ton. The cost of coal consumed by 100 MW power plant is (53.8 x 65) 3497 $ /hr. A 100 MW unit produces 100,000 units of electricity. So the cost of coal per unit of electricity is (3497/100,000) 3.5 cents per unit.

## With comfortable coal stocks, no power crisis this festive season
2 days agoIndia is unlikely to see a repeat of the 2021 energy crisis this festive season as coal-fired power stations across the country have comfortable levels of the fuel stock to meet electricity demand of the world's fastest expanding major economy. Learning lessons from the October 2021 energy crisis, when power stations were put on outage alert, due to coal stocks falling to the lowest level in

## Coal Based Power Plant Process Costing
Oct 12, 2020Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants, while producing power, require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.
