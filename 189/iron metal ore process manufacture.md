## Iron Forge in Colonial America - Revolutionary War Journal
By the late 1600's and early 1700's, iron ore was still being mined in Virginia and western Massachusetts. Small scale bloomeries, the most primitive form of smelting, reduced the ore into a porous mass of iron slag called bloom or sponge iron.The bloom was hammered into a low quality wrought iron by using hand held or large, heavy hammers powered by water.

Step 1 - The iron making process. As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made. Iron ore, lime, and coke are placed into a blast furnace and melted. The resulting liquid known as molten iron is then formed. As molten iron still contains around 4% - 4.5% impurities such as carbon which in turn make the metal brittle

## iron metal ore process manufacture
233 Metallurgy of Iron and Steel. Sep 18, 2019 0183 32 The early application of iron to the manufacture of tools and weapons was possible because of the wide distribution of iron ores and the ease with which iron compounds in the ores could be reduced by carbon For a long time, charcoal was the form of carbon used in the reduction process

## Manufacturing Process of Cast Iron Castings
Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape. Molds and pouring methods divide this process up. Molds can be made as expendable molds (sand) or non-expendable molds (metal). Pouring can happen via gravity, low-pressure or vacuum. Controlling the pouring process becomes more important the more intricate the mold is.
