## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.  In fact, copper is one of the most abundant of the metallic elements in the earth's crust. The average estimated concentration is between 55 and 70 mg/kg, placing it below chromium (200 mg/kg) and zinc

Well, grade is just another way of talking about the weight of copper. For example, if you mine 1 000 kilograms of rock, and 30 kilograms is made up of copper, then the average grade would be 3%. The global average grade of copper ores today is about 0.6% (meaning for every 1 000 kilograms of rock mined six kilograms will be copper).
