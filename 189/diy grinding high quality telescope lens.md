## diy - Is it possible for a hobbyist to create a lens element 
The manufacture of a lens element that is pure enough to be used for photography is pretty complex. You need materials with adequate purity, light transmission, and hardness, not to mention a fair bit of precision in your grinding mechanism to ensure you refract light enough to focus it where you want it focused, and do so evenly across the surface of the lens.

## Grinding own mirror gives you a spherical or a parabolic curve? - DIY 
680. Location: Tewkesbury, UK. Posted August 24, 2012. The natural mirror grinding process will create a sphere. The first part of making a mirror is to grind and polish to a sphere of the required focal length. Then the mirror is parabolised, by using special polishing strokes, that changes the figure from sphere to paraboloid.

## Manually grinding a lens - ATM, Optics and DIY Forum - Cloudy Nights
Jan 8, 2021Page 1 of 2 - Manually grinding a lens - posted in ATM, Optics and DIY Forum: Hello, I'll start to grind a lens with a photographer friend who wanted after years of photography to make one himself to get a feel of the process. The first one will be made in a schott mirror blank, 102mm/15mm thick, and will be plano-convex. We don't expect it to give diffraction limited pictures since the

## 10 DIY Telescope You Can Build On The Cheap
8. Beginners Telescope. This beginners telescope can be built for under $20 and provide hours of viewing pleasure. Great for the want-to-be astronomer, this design is powerful enough to provide a sharp, clear view of Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. The image will also be clear enough so you can see the craters on the moon.

We can also have a Refractor Telescope with a High Quality Single Objective PCX lens, with 120mm and 4000mm focal length. If the tube is long, we can use two flat mirrors to reduce the size. (We all should know), but a lens working in R G B mode, is allowed this lens: have this diameter of 120mm and 4000mm focal length.

unchanged. This paper serves as a basic overview of how a lens is manufactured from a blank. A lens is typically ordered from a glass company in a form called a glass blank. From there, the lens goes through generation where the rough shape is ground into the blank. A lens is then blocked and undergoes further grinding to improve the surface
