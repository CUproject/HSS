## Understanding Relationship Between Pressure, Pressure Drop, and Flow Rate
1b: There are multiple ways pumps work in real life. Commonly you can have a pump that just spins at a certain RPM like a ceiling fan at one constant rate. You control the flow rate via a control valve by introducing pressure drop in the system. More pressure drop across a control valve = less flow.

Jun 8, 2021So, when pressure in the pump causes more load on the motor, it slows down. When the motor slows down, the flow rate drops at the same percentage. A motor that operates at about 2000 RPM at low pressures will typically slow down to about 1750 RPM when the pump is pressurized to the maximum rating. It stands to reason, then, that increasing pump

## The Difference Between Pressure and Flow
Since there is no resistance to the flow, the gauge reads 0 PSI. Next, the hand valve is closed blocking the zero-resistance path to the drum leaving only the path through the relief valve. The pressure on the gauge then builds to 500 PSI, the relief valve opens and flow is passed through it. Pressure is thus the result of resistance to flow.

## Effects of Viscosity on Positive Displacement Pumps
Jun 22, 2021Positive displacement pumps are all affected by internal leakage. Fluid can flow between thin gaps, between sliding components or through micro-gaps in internal seals. Higher viscosity fluids are less prone to flow through internal gaps. Thus the higher the viscosity, the less sensitive the displacement will be to pressure differential.

The relationship between flow rate and pressure is that the flow rate is inversely proportional to the pressure. That is, as the pressure increases, the flow rate decreases.

They are considered fixed displacement pumps, meaning that an unchanging volume of liquid moves through at a constant rate provided the pump speed is constant. Gear pumps generally work within the following ranges: Flow rate ranges between 1 and 1,500 gpm. Total head (pressure) ranges between 10 and 2,500 psi.

Some fluid will seep through the gap between the sides of the gears and the endplates (see figure below.) This gap must be small in order to maintain the pressure increase across the pump. Increasing the gap diminishes the pumps ability to hold a pressure difference between the inlet and outlet. The gap is typically around 0.0005 inches.

## Pump Power Calculation | Neutrium
Power is consumed by a pump, fan or compressor in order to move and increase the pressure of a fluid. The power requirement of the pump depends on a number of factors including the pump and motor efficiency, the differential pressure and the fluid density, viscosity and flow rate. This article provides relationships to determine the required pump power.

## How to Calculate Pump Horsepower - Pivotal Pumps
The rate of flow through the system in gallons per minute. Specific Gravity: The relative specific gravity of the liquid in the system. Water has a Specific Gravity value of 1. 8.33 Lbs/Gallon: The constant weight of one gallon of water. Inter-played with a specific gravity value, this constant provides the basis for work accomplished. 33,000
