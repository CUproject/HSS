## New Zealand's Coal Deposits - GNS Science
New Zealand coals are mainly 25 to 70 million years old - relatively young compared to many overseas coal deposits. This is due to the highly active geology of New Zealand. Peat deposits have been buried relatively quickly to suitable depths for 'coalification', followed by uplift and erosion that makes them accessible for mining.
