## Is anthracite a coking coal? - Daily Justnow
Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke, the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. Metallurgical coal differs from thermal coal, which is used for energy and heating, by its carbon content and its coking ability. What type of coal is anthracite? Anthracite: The highest rank of coal.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal is also called 'met coal' or 'coking coal. It is a bituminous coal which allows the production of a coke suitable to support a blast furnace (BF) charge.  During carbonization, most bituminous coals, except those bordering on the lignite coals and semi-anthracite coals, show evidence of softening

Metallurgical coal or coking coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke.Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking. The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel. Primary steelmaking companies often have a division that produces coal for coking, to ensure a stable and low-cost supply

Metallurgical (met) coal (or coking coal) is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth's crust. Categories of met coal include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking-coal, semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal for injection (PCI). These apply to the different quality grades of met coal, all of which are used to make steel.

## Investigation of resole, novalac and coal tar pitch blended binder for 
In the work of Ayse Benk et al. anthracite could be used for production of metallurgical quality formed coke for that anthracite as the best coal has high original strength and low volatile matter

##  Comparative Carbon Footprints of Metallurgical Coke and Anthracite for 
differences between anthracite and metallurgical coke are small, sometimes favoring one, and sometimes the other. For the segments other than coking, different assumptions regarding coal provenance and properties, steel mill locations, or blast furnace operating conditions might have reversed an apparent advantage for anthracite
