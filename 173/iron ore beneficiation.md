Iron Ore Beneficiation. Once deposits of iron ore are extracted from the ground, they must be processed in order to increase the iron content and decrease the concentration of gangue minerals. Each deposit has its own unique chemical properties. In order to create a usable amount of iron (Fe), other minerals must be removed from the ore.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
