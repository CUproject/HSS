## Difference Between Classical Economics and Neoclassical Economics
• Neo classical economics and classical economics are two very distinct schools of thought that define the economic concepts quite differently. • Classical economic theory is the belief that a self-regulating economy is the most efficient and effective because as needs arise people will adjust to serving each other's requirements.

## Introducing Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply | Boundless Economics 
Classical economics focuses on the growth in the wealth of nations and promotes policies that create national economic expansion. Classical theory assumptions include the beliefs that markets self-regulate, prices are flexible for goods and wages, supply creates its own demand, and there is equality between savings and investments.

## The Classical Theory - CliffsNotes
The fundamental principle of the classical theory is that the economy is self‐regulating. Classical economists maintain that the economy is always capable of achieving the natural level of real GDP or output, which is the level of real GDP that is obtained when the economy's resources are fully employed. While circumstances arise from time to time that cause the economy to fall below or to

## Keynesian Economics Vs. Classical Economics: Similarities And 
Keynesian economics is an economic theory developed during the great depression. It emphasizes the total spending in the economy, the effect on inflation and output. Classical economics, on the other hand, pertains to capitalistic market developments and self-regulating democracies. It came about shortly after the creation of western capitalism.

Classical economics originally differed from modern libertarian economics in seeing a role for the state in providing for the common good.

Generally, political liberals would side with Classical economics. Keynesian Theory rejects Say's Law of self-regulation and suggests that the relationship between aggregate income and expenditure is key. Keynesian believers agree that government should step in and implement policies that will regulate the economy more efficiently.

Similarly, the main goal of neo-classical economics is to enable efficient allocation of scarce resources.

## Classical economics - definition and meaning - Market Business News
Classical economics is a school of economic thought that was developed by Adam Smith in the 18th and 19th century, supporting the free market.  Classical economists give the Model T Ford as an example of this idea. The Model T was a car that the Ford Motor Company produced from 1908 to 1927. It was, in fact, the first affordable automobile.
