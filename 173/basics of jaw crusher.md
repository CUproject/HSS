## Jaw crusher maintenance : Pit & Quarry
"Successful jaw crusher maintenance requires the right resources, the right tools and the right approach," says Bill Macini, a Telsmith service technician.. Certainly when an operation is down, whether for preventive maintenance or component failure, there is always the pressure to get the plant up and running as soon as possible.

## Basic Information About The Crusher
Jaw Crusher; Basic Information About The Crusher. There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action. A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.

For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## About Jaw Crushers | Omnia Machinery
3 days agoThe movable jaw applies pressure on the rock and pushes it against the stationary plate, the rocks then remain between the jaws until the material is small enough to pass through the space at the bottom of the jaws. There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle which are categorised by their jaw movement mechanism.

Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates.
