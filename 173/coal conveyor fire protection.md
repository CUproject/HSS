## Conveyor belt fires are significant risks | Martin Engineering
A conveyor belt fire is a significant risk. The belting itself can burn; however, it is the length and movement of the belt that poses risks that a belt can spread a fire over a great distance within a facility in a very short time. Conveyor belts are key factors in the overall productivity of the entire plant.

Industrial fire detection specialists Patol have demonstrated the particular suitability of their transit heat sensor to coal conveying applications with a new video shot at Wales' last remaining coal fired power station.. Patol's 5000 series of early warning infrared transit heat sensors are protecting the conveyors at Aberthaw power station, in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Many conveyor belt manufacturers are to be commended in developing fire-retardant conveyor belts. Ultimately though, these belts still have an ignition temperature although this temperature is higher than standard belts. If sufficient energy is applied to a fire retardant conveyor belt from a jammed idler for example, they will still ignite.

To assist in quantifying the coal product fraction in the airborne samples, NIOSH collected an uncontaminated sample of bulk coal at the mining face. For each day of sampling, coal was scooped from the conveyor boom of the continuous miner into a jar (grab sample) and ultimately sieved to ≤ 74 μm for analysis.

## Detecting moving fires on coal conveyors - Power Engineering
To date, coal conveyor fire protection systems have typically involved the use of line-/spot-type heat detection technology coupled with a sprinkler system. These components are generally hung
