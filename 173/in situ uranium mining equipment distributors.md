The project's primary objective is to evaluate the reducing capacity of an aquifer down-gradient of a roll-front ore zone to assess the mobility of uranium and other associated elements (e.g. arsenic, selenium, molybdenum, and sulfur). Assessing the reducing capacity of the aquifer requires characterization of the mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology and their variation across the aquifer.

Once the ore is exposed, it is mined using large earth-moving equipment and hauled to a mill for processing. 2. Milling

Uranium decays into radium and radon gas, and other "daughter" products. Over hundreds of thousands, or millions, of years, these decay products build up and contaminate the water in and near the ore body. For example, the U.S. EPA has a proposed maximum level for radon gas of 300 pCi/L in drinking water.

This is because there is a reduced need for workers to physically enter the mine. The miners only need to drill into the ore body, not enter it.

## In-Situ Leach Mining of Uranium - Stanford University
Introduction to In-Situ Leach Mining. Fig. 1: The In-Situ Uranium Recovery Process. [3] Injection wells (1) pump a chemical solution into the layer of earth containing the Uranium. The solution dissolves the Uranium and is then pumped back to the surface through recovery wells (2). Monitoring wells (3) are checked regularly.
