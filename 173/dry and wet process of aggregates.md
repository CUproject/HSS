## Difference between Wet and Dry process of cement
Wet process. Mixing of Raw materials in wash mill with 35 to 50% water. Materials exiting the mill are called "slurry" and have flow-ability characteristics. Size of the kiln needed for manufacturing of cement is bigger. Raw material can be mixed easily, so a better homogeneous material can be obtained
