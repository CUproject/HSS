Sep 14, 2022Compounds. Of the wide variety of compounds formed by manganese, the most stable occur in oxidation states +2, +6, and +7. These are exemplified, respectively, by the manganous salts (with manganese as the Mn 2+ ion), the manganates (MnO 4 2−), and the permanganates (MnO 4 −).As in the case of titanium, vanadium, and chromium, the highest oxidation state (+7) of manganese corresponds to

## A technology of preparing MnO2 nanowire from the low grade manganese ore
The MnO 2 nanowire is prepared from low grade manganese ore by a hydrothermal method technology. After low grade manganese was reduced by the biomass to be MnO, the roasted slag was leached by dilute sulphuric acid to be MnSO 4 solution. Lastly, KMnO 4 particle was added in the MnSO 4 solution to finish the oxidation-reduction process.
