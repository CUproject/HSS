How coal is pulverized? Pieces of coal are crushed between balls or cylindrical rollers that move between two tracks or "races." The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650 °F (340 °C) from the boiler.  The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler.

The material that has to be pulverized is loaded in the center or on the side. The air flow in the pulverizer carries out the pulverized material. The size of the pulverized material totally depends on the classifier separator. If the coal or any other material for that matter is light enough to be picked by the air, it goes to the classifier.

## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
Coal for Power Plants. The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity. The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal. All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process. Before going into the details, let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.
