## How to Use a Concrete Floor Grinder
Don't Apply Pressure. If you don't remember anything else, make sure that you don't apply any pressure to the concrete floor grinder. Grinders already do their job naturally without any added pressure, and by placing extra weight on the machine you could end up creating divots that you'll have to remove later, further adding to your work time.
