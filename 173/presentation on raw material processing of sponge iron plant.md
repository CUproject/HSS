DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) is a type of Iron formed by reduction of Iron Oxides to it's metallic form in process below the melting point of both Iron & its oxides. As it is a solid-state process, the shape of Oxide remains same at its metallic form. As the oxide is directly reduced, a lot of microscopic pores are formed in the reduced metal.

The substitution of scrap by sponge iron has some limitations depending on the furnace operating conditions. Only 20% to 30% of sponge iron can be used in the furnace charge when feeding is done in batches. The proportion of sponge iron in the charge can however be increased to 40-50% by providing continuous feeding arrangements.
