DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) is a type of Iron formed by reduction of Iron Oxides to it's metallic form in process below the melting point of both Iron & its oxides. As it is a solid-state process, the shape of Oxide remains same at its metallic form. As the oxide is directly reduced, a lot of microscopic pores are formed in the reduced metal.

The substitution of scrap by sponge iron has some limitations depending on the furnace operating conditions. Only 20% to 30% of sponge iron can be used in the furnace charge when feeding is done in batches. The proportion of sponge iron in the charge can however be increased to 40-50% by providing continuous feeding arrangements.

Iron Sponge Process. The iron sponge process uses the chemical reaction of ferric oxide with H2S to sweeten gas streams. This process is applied to gases with low H2S concentrations (300 ppm) operating at low to moderate pressures (50-500 psig). Carbon dioxide is not removed by this process. Read More

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting
