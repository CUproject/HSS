Caption. Neural nets are so named because they roughly approximate the structure of the human brain. Typically, they're arranged into layers, and each layer consists of many simple processing units — nodes — each of which is connected to several nodes in the layers above and below. Data is fed into the lowest layer, whose nodes process it

Nov 8, 2021The mind-reading is done by computer devices that are specially made for this purpose. Mind-reading devices make use of facial expressions of people in knowing what they feel. The goal of such a device is to increase the interaction between a computer and a human being. It needs the use of a digital video camera that records human expressions.

## What about mind-reading technology? - Tech Entice
What about mind-reading technology? It was once thought to be the stuff of science fiction. But now, the idea that machines can read people's minds and interpret their thoughts is becoming a reality. Through artificial intelligence and software development outsourcing, some organizations have taken the plunge and begun to tap into the world

## This Device Just Made Mind Reading Possible - GineersNow
Mind-reading is a human ability that exists only in fiction, well, because it is way beyond the ordinary psychic power. But now, science just made mind-reading happen - at least at some level. A device has been made by Toyohashi University of Technology in Japan to make reading people's minds possible in the near future. As the people spoke, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to

Artificial intelligence has taken us one baby step closer to the mind-reading machines of science fiction. Researchers have developed "deep learning" algorithms—roughly modeled on the human brain—to decipher, you guessed it, the human brain. First, they built a model of how the brain encodes information.
