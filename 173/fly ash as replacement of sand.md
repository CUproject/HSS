## Fly Ash Topic - American Concrete Institute
Fly ash is a by-product from the combustion of pulverized coal, and is widely used as an ingredient in hydraulic-cement concrete. Because it improves many desirable properties of concrete, it is introduced either as a separately batched material or as a component of blended cement. Fly ash reacts with the hydrating hydraulic cement to form a cementing medium.

## Using Fly Ash in Concrete - Precast
Typically, fly ash is added to structural concrete at 15-35 percent by weight of the cement, but up to 70 percent is added for mass concrete used in dams, roller-compacted concrete pavements, and parking areas. Special care must be taken in selecting fly ash to ensure improved properties in concrete. Standards.

After 40% replacement the tensile strength decreases.

## Investigation of coal bottom ash and fly ash in concrete as replacement 
Coal bottom ash (CBA) was collected from Tanjung Bin coal power thermal plant Johor, Malaysia. Particle size distribution of CBA and river sand are shown in Fig. 2.CBA was graded in accordance with the specification of ASTM C33/C33M-13 .In this research, CBA was sieved through 4.75 mm sieve before use as replacement of sand.The chemical properties of CBA are presented in Table 1.

3 days agoCurrently, a soil stabilization approach using fly ash as an effective choice for increasing soil stiffness and strength has emerged. With the presence of water, the lime in the fly ash would be separated, generating cementitious materials binding the grains of sand. In the present study, the influence of curing time and saturation during specimen preparation on the behavior of fly ash

## Fly Ash instead of Cement - Concrete Decor
Fly ash is a pozzolan — to make cement, just add water. Combined with lime and water, it forms a mixture that is similar to portland cement. But it is just an additive, rather than a replacement for portland cement. It is routinely used in 15 percent to 25 percent dosages in ready mix. Like slag, fly ash is not a new development in the
