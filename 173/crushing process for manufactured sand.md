Aug 24, 2021The manufacturing process of M sand. The manufacturing process for M sand takes place in three stages: Firstly, it involves crushing stones of varying sizes into aggregates using vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers. The material is then fed into a Rotopactor for crushing the aggregates into sand to the desired grain size.
