## Minerals and Mining in South Africa | SpringerLink
Abstract. Mining in southern Africa has a long pre-colonial history. Haematite mining in Swaziland can be traced back more than 40,000 years, iron smelting dates from 400 AD or earlier, and copper from 900 AD. The most iconic evidence for pre-colonial mining are the gold artefacts from Mapungubwe dated between 1220 and 1300 AD.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

The gold-mining industry of South Africa developed at an impressive rate despite various challenges that included high production costs as well as a huge labour demand. The 53 mines along the Witswatersrand reached their peak in 1970, producing some 1147 tons of gold. Golden nuggets. Photo: theflyermag.

## Iron metallurgy in Africa
The topic of early iron-metallurgy in Africa encompasses both studies of the technology and archaeology of indigenous iron-production.. Some recent studies date the inception of iron metallurgy in Africa between 3000 and 2500 BCE. Evidence exists for earlier iron metallurgy in parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Central Africa, possibly from as early as around 2,000 BCE.

## History Of Kruger Park - Iron Age - South Africa
In the Kruger Park area, the Ntu tribes settled along the Limpopo, Luvuvhu, Shingwedzi and Letaba Rivers, moving to the Sabie and Crocodile rivers later. The life of Iron Age farmers differed from that of Khoisan hunters and gatherers in the following ways: They cultivated crops and kept domestic livestock. They lived in semi-permanent villages.
