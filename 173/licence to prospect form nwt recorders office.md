##  Prospecting permit guide
Prospecting permits may be granted for any combination of prospecting, hand mining, or pegging. Prospecting permits that include hand mining or prospecting have additional requirements compared to a prospecting permit for pegging only. Prospecting is the act of finding the existence, quality or quantity of minerals on, in or under land.
