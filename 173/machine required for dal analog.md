An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) integrate into a small chip.This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller

## What is a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and How Does it Work?
During playback, a DAC decodes the stored digital signals. In doing so, the DAC converts those signals back into analog audio. A DAC sends the converted analog signals to an amplifier. The amplifier, in turn, sends music through your headphones or stereo speakers.

## Is DAL-A required for twin-engine helicopters with FADEC?
The requirements there often are more stringent than at the aircraft level as the engine is normally developed for the most stringent application of the engine. Looking for guidance we can start with Part 33 which gives us the rule that the DAL must be appropriate to the risks identified in the safety analysis.

## When was the Digital Delay in Record Cutting First Introduced?
It has been proposed to place analog delay devices in the signal path between the audio signal source and the disk cutting lathe to provide the necessary delay for previewing. However, the long delay required for previewing necessitates a sizable delay device; and a sizable delay device degrades the quality of the analog signal passing through it.
