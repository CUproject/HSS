## What Are The Negative Effects Of Sand Mining? - WorldAtlas
By removing too much sediment from rivers, sand mining also leads to the erosion and shrinking of river banks. Deltas can recede due to sand mining. All of these destructive effects of sand mining ultimately lead to the loss of fertile land and property. It also destabilizes the ground and causes the failure of bridges, dikes, and roads.
