## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

The main raw material in iron-steel industry is iron ore. Iron ores can be classified as high grade and low grade in terms of their Fe content. High grade iron ores which can be used directly in the blast furnace to produce metallic iron are not abundant in earth's crust to supply the need of iron-steel industry.
