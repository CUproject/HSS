Limestone though was the basic available stone. Easy to quarry and dress, it also bonds well with cement (limestone being its source). The limestone in question has been variously described over the years with many different nomenclatures, but the current consensus is that it is of the Mississippian Arroyo Penasco Group/La Pasada formation.

Limestone quarries lack protection of retaining walls or fences around the border of the steep sloped quarry. Increased environmental degradation and socio- economic conflicts. Water spring: There are some natural water springs which added value to the area. But now there is a problem of water pollution due to dust and reduce the level of water.
