Cast-in-place concrete piles, or driven shafts are two great examples of how the can be produced (made) and installed. When choosing a pile type, one should generally consider the following conditions: 1- Poor quality of upper soil layers. 2 - When we have expansive soil in construction site. 3- To resist uplift forces.
