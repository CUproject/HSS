The procedure of crushing the stone has three stages. The first stage is breaking down the stone to small sizes. The second stage is crushing down the sizable stones to suit a specific purpose. On the third stage, the stones are screened for finished products. Sand and gravel are the most common minerals used in creating concrete.

## Difference Between 6 Common Stone Crusher Machines
Feb 14, 2022The softness and hardness of the material is usually expressed using Mohs hardness, which is divided into ten levels. The higher the level, the harder the material is, the more difficult it is to crush, and the higher the requirements for crushing equipment. For example, the granite has a Mohs hardness of about 6 to 7.
