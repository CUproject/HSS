## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## Detailed analysis of iron ore beneficiation process
Generally, the combined process of weak magnetic separation and flotation is used to recover iron, sulfide or apatite by flotation.Principle processes are divided into two types: weak magnetic separation-flotation and flotation-weak magnetic separation. The direction of conjoints of magnetite and sulfide in these two processes is different.
