Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

For sulfide ores, a different process is taken for beneficiation. The ore needs to have the sulfur removed before smelting can begin.  The gangue that is found with lithium after the flotation are often iron bearing. The float concentrate goes through magnetic separation to remove the magnetic gangue from the nonmagnetic lithium.
