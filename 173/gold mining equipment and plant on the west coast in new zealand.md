Mining. Mining has been part of New Zealand's history since the 1800s producing gold, coal, aggregates, industrial minerals, limestone, and iron sands. However, mining can have significant impacts on the environment and must be managed in a way to minimise those impacts and ensure long term environmental sustainability.
