## DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MINI BALL MILL. - Learn Mechanical Engineering
This project is to design and fabricate the mini ball mill that can grind the solid state of various type of materials into nano-powder. The cylindrical jar is used as a mill that would rotate the material that about to be ground, a motor is used to power the system so that the jar can rotate in high speed and using the regulator controls the speed of the rotation of the jar.

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

## Design, Construction, and Operation of a High-Energy Mill for Handling 
A high-energy mill was designed and built with the purpose of processing magnesium (Mg) powders. The main characteristics of the mill are grinding capacity of 1 kg and demolition elements of 10 kg; it has a distributed form to the interior ten blades of similar geometry, six of which are of the same size and four of them were increased in length in order to avoid the accumulation of the ground
