gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Material testing using mechanical cross sectioning is one of five main operations in the preparation of metallographic specimens. It involves removing a conveniently shaped, representative specimen from a larger sample. Mounting, grinding, polishing, and etching are the remaining operations. Examinations of metal structures are usually done on parts that have been removed from a bulk specimen.

Crafting materials worth 1-2 gold each isn't going to break the economic system. No one will get rich by selling materials, and the crafted items would sell for more than the sum of their parts (in response to @SenorCinco). Giving the components some value gives players the option to loot without the necessity of crafting.
