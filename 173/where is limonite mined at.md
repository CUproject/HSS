## Goethite: The mineral goethite information and pictures
Goethite is found throughout the world, though collection-worthy specimens are less common. Branching stalactites and botryoidal masses, often associated with bright contrasting Vanadinite, come from the Four Man Mine, Taouz, Morocco.Recent finds of branching Goethite pseudomorphs after Marcasite are exceptional at the Farfara Oasis, in the White Desert of Egypt.
