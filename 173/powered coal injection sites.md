## How coal-fired power plants clean their fumes | SOLVAir®
What SOLVAir® can do for coal-fired power plants Direct injection into the flue gases. SOLVAir®'s solution uses a specifically engineered Dry Sorbent Injection system (DSI), where the appropriate sodium sorbent is injected into the raw flue gases of the coal-fired power plant.. The sorbent is stored in an on-site storage system requiring a small foot print.

## Pulverized Coal Injection in a Blast Furnace - IspatGuru
Pulverized coal injection (PCI) is a process which involves injecting large volumes of fine coal particles into the raceway of the blast furnace (BF). Pulverized coal is an important auxiliary fuel used in the BF ironmaking. PCI provides auxiliary fuel for partial coke replacement and has proven both economically and environmentally favourable.

## An update on blast furnace granular coal injection
Coal injection rates on the two Burns Harbor furnaces were increased throughout 1995 and was over 200 lbs/ton on C furnace in September. The injection rate on C furnace reached 270 lbs/ton by mid-1996. A comparison of high volatile and low volatile coals as injectants shows that low volatile coal replaces more coke and results in a better blast

## Pulverized coal injection method
Pulverized coal injection is a method for improving the performance of a blast furnace. Background. Iron is a metal that has fundamentally affected the way of life of human beings ever since the Iron Age. It is relatively abundant and can easily be extracted and modified due to its useful material properties, all of which result in low prices.

The four sites, shown in Table 2, burn coal and have particulate control devices only (no scrubbers); this is representative of three-quarters of the coal-fired electric utility boilers in the US. At each site, sorbent injection for mercury control was implemented on full-scale particulate control devices to obtain performance and operational data.

## Pulverized Coal Injection - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
The use of oxy-coal enables around 20% increase in coal injection and help reduce coke quantities accordingly (Worrell et al., 2010). With 170 - 200 kg/t-HM pulverized coal injection, coke consumptions as low as 286 - 320 kg/t-HM has been achieved in modern blast furnaces. However, global average for PCI remained at 125 kg/t-HM in 2005 (IEA

## Coal and the Blast Furnace
Solid Fuel Injection. The first commercial blast furnace to be equipped for solid fuel injection was the No. 2 blast furnace at the Hanna Furnace Corporation in Buffalo, New York. In December of 1960, the installation of the equipment was completed. The first coal was injected in December of 1960. This initial coal injection work was primarily
