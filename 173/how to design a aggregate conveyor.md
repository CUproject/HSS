Oct 10, 2021So, the capacity of the conveyor in 5 minute is ( (505)/25)  2. ie, 20 nos. So the capacity of this particular conveyor is 20 parts in 5 minutes or it will move 1 part in 15 Seconds. Hence the formula for the conveyor capacity is, ( (conveyor speed  time)/ (length of part))  no of parts along width of conveyor.
