Iron ore has remained one of the unexploited base mineral in Zimbabwe, despite holding immense potential to turnaround the fortunes of the economy. The international price of iron ore broke through the $80 a tonne barrier last Friday, up from $38 per tonne at the end of last year, although still below the peak of $182 a tonne in 2010.

Iron ore pelletisation BRPL is in operation in producing iron ore pellets from iron ore concentrates after beneficiating low grade iron ore fines. The low grade fines with Fe less than 5657% are beneficiated at beneficiation plant through grinding, gravity magnetic separation process to produce high grade iron ore concentrates with 6364% Fe.

## Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional 
Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional beneficiation plants The hematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is always associated with limonite & goethite ores, which cannot be attracted by high gauss magnetic separators in the conventional beneficiation plants. Such tailings have 30-50% left-over Fe, which is a waste of natural resources.

Zimbabwe Beneficiation Tests Original Spot. agbaja iron ore beneficiation. Agbaja iron ore a highphosphorus iron ore has been characterized using a variety of analysis techniques in an attempt to unravel the presentation and distribution of phosphorus in the iron ore between the ironrich phase and the gangue minerals which will be very useful in planning effective beneficiation and phosphorus
