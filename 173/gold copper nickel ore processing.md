## Nickel Ore Mining Process,Processing Nickel Ores,Nickel Process Serving 
When floatability difference happens to the various nickel elements in the raw ore, the nickel ore can be recycled from tailings after the copper and nickel did the mixing flotation. Copper- Nickel Ore Flotation Process: A basic principle of copper-sulfide nickel ore process is that it is better to let the coppers assimilate into the nickel ore.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
