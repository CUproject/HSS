As per IS 456, the individual compressive value of a concrete cube should not be less than 75% of its grade. Example - If the concrete grade is M20, then the individual crushing value should not be less than 15 N/Sqmm. The individual crushing value difference between the cube should not be greater than 15%.

compressive strength test, mechanical test measuring the maximum amount of compressive load a material can bear before fracturing. The test piece, usually in the form of a cube, prism, or cylinder, is compressed between the platens of a compression-testing machine by a gradually applied load.
