## Quarries and Sand Pits - Irish Concrete Federation
Sand and Gravel Pits. Sand and gravel pits are shallower than rock quarries because the deposits are usually less than the equivalent of one bench of a rock quarry. The material is excavated with a mechanical shovel and is then carried by conveyor to a plant where it is crushed, washed and screened into different sizes.

## Gravel or Stone, what's the difference?
Gravel is a mixture of crushed stone and sand. This can get confusing since there is stone mixed in with the sand and sometimes people don't realize what they're buying when they hear "stone with sand". This is a very popular product, but it wouldn't be ideal for a walkway or the top layer of a driveway.

After groundwater fills the pit, a dredge floated on the water is used to remove sand from the bottom of the pit. Many small lakes in Kansas flood plains, especially near the Arkansas River, were dug as sand pits. In dry pit mining of sand and gravel, the sediment is removed from an excavation pit with front-end loaders and loaded into trucks.
