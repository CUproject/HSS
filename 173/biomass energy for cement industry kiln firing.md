Jul 1, 2022Biomass is one such promising low-carbon resource that shall be explored. For instance, 90% of renewable heat in the industry is derived from biomass [ 28 ]. Process heat accounts for 70-80% of the total energy requirement in cement manufacturing, and this could potentially be met using energy derived from biomass.

## Modeling of the Thermochemical Conversion of Biomass in Cement Rotary Kiln
The cement industry is not excluded from the list. The cement industry is considered as one of the most energy-intensive industry, with an energy consumption rate ranging from 30 to 40% of the final production cost . The largest share of energy consumption is in the workshop rotary kiln firing. Rotary kilns are mainly used in cement industries.
