What are Aggregate in Construction Industry ? In the construction industry, aggregate are used as filler material in the production of concrete and mortar. Aggregate occupy around 70% to 80% of the volume of the concrete, reduce shrinkage effects and minimize costs. The coarse aggregate form the main matrix of concrete and the fine aggregates form the filler matrix between the coarse aggregate.

## crushing strength test of coarse aggregate
Sep 05, 2015 0183 32 This paper studied the effect of aggregate properties on the crushing strength of concrete In order to achieve the study objective, three types of coarse aggregates, brick khoa, shingles stone, and black stone were used to test And the test results show that concrete made from black stone has the highest workability followed by shingles stone brick khoa of aggregat

##  1 Lecture 6: Testing of aggregates - Aligarh Muslim University
The test for strength of aggregate is required to be made in the following situations: i. For production of high strength & ultra -high strength concrete.  Very often at the site of concrete work we may meet dry coarse aggregate and moist fine aggregate. The  The standard aggregate crushing test is made on aggregate passing a 12.5 mm I.S

## Los Angeles Abrasion Test On Aggregates - [ Civil Planets ]
The abrasion test is conducted on the aggregates to know its toughness and resistance such as crushing, degradation and disintegration. It is more like a Charpy impact test for metal toughness. It is conducted in three different methods. Here we are going to discuss the Los Angeles abrasion test method, which is widely used to determine the
