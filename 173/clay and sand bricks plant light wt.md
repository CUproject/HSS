Advantages of calcium silicate bricks: The mortar required to provide plaster on calcium silicate bricks is very low. The color and texture of those bricks are the same. The comparative strength of sand-lime bricks is about 10N/mm2, so they are suitable for multi-story buildings. For construction in clay soils, these bricks are preferable.

##  Light Weight Clay Bricks in Combination of Sludge Blended with Agro/Wastes
Abstract: The objective of the study is to produce light weight bricks to use as an isolating layer. So, porous or light weight bricks were prepared from clay, sludge, agro/ashes as Saw dust ash (DSA), sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) and corn stalk ash (CSA) fired up to 900°C. Physical and mechanical properties were investigated.
