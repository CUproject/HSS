GRANITE POWDER CONCRETE Abstract—Granite is an igneous rock which is widely used as construction material in different forms. Granite industries produce lot of dust and waste materials. The wastes from the granite polishing units are being disposed to environment which cause health hazard. This granite powder waste can be utilized for the preparation of concrete as partial replacement of sand.

Self-compacting concrete can be used for speedy construction as it sets rapidly. Granite powder reduces the workability when added in large amount. Super plasticizer acts a governing agent for setting time of concrete. If 2% super plasticizer of cement content is added, the concrete sets within 10 minutes.

## Decomposed graniteoslodownia.pl
Decomposed granite. Decomposed granite is usually mechanically screened to 3/8" and 3/8" minus sizes, with a few DG products offered in 1/4" minus sizes. We consult designers and buyers to use 3/8" and 3/8" minus materials as we consider 1/4" materials to fine and "concrete" looking when installed, losing any natural look.
