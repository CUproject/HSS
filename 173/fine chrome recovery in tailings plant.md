However, these techniques become inefficient and complex when treating fine and ultrafine size particles (less than 75µm) resulting in this size fraction lost to the tailings. As a result, a wet magnetic separation technology for recovery of ultra-fine chromite (Cr 2 O 3) from spirals tailings as a scavenger was investigated.
