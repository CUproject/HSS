## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers | Agg-Net
Cone and gyratory crushers. Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are also compression-type machines that crush material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The output is controlled by the setting between the two pieces of steel. Though the chamber is round in shape, the moving piece of steel is not meant to rotate.
