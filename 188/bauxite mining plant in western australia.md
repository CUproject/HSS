Interest in bauxite mining in the South West Western Australia stretches back to the 1960s. However, mining and refining the ore didn't get underway until the 1980s. At the time, building the mine, conveyor belt and processing plant was Australia's most expensive capital project, costing AUD$1.2 billion and employing 3500 people.

## Bauxite mining in Australia
Australia is the world's largest bauxite producer, producing almost a third of global bauxite. [2] Bauxite is mined in Australia using open-cut mining, which suits the relatively shallow bauxite deposits located mostly in Western Australia and Queensland.
