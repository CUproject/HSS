## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
Sep 17, 2022Taking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
Gyratory crushers are used in mine or ore processing plants and they can be used for primary or secondary crushing. It crushes rocks by rotating the vertical shaft and crushing the rocks in a circular motion where they fall out the narrow bottom when they are small enough.A gyratory crusher is used both for primary or secondary crushing. Cone
