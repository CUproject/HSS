## Different Types of Aggregate and How They're Used | Haynes
Aggregate is a landscaping term that's used to describe coarse to medium grain material. The most common types of aggregate that are used in landscaping include: crushed stone, gravel, sand, and fill. Varying in material and stone size, each type can have its own purpose when it comes to landscaping projects.
