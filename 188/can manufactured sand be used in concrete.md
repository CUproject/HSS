M. Sand: An Alternative to the River Sand in Construction. for concrete construction. Manufactured sand is produced from hard granite stone by crushing. The crushed sand is of cubical shape with grounded edges, washed and graded to as a construction material. The size of manufactured sand (M-Sand) is less than 4.75mm.

The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.

## A promising future for manufactured sand - Aggregate Research International
Crushed sand can replace natural sand in many applications. Sand - whether extracted from natural gravel or sand deposits or made by crushing bedrock - is used in many applications because of its mineral and physical qualities. The most typical application for sand is concrete, where it accounts for approximately 30-40% of the material

## Can someone suggest an alternative of sand as a fine aggregate in concrete?
Manufactured sand blended with natural sand in the ratio of 70:30 can be used as fine aggregate in concrete, which shows the better performance than conventional concrete.
