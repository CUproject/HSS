## Green Mechanic: Manufacturing Processes
Processing Process. Alters a work part's shape, physical properties, or appearance in order to add value to the material. Three categories of processing operations: 1. Shaping operations - alter the geometry of the starting work material. 2. Property-enhancing operations - improve physical properties of the material without changing its shape. 3.

Concentration is the process of extracting the economic product from the crushed and ground ore, the waste from this process is the tailings. Froth flotation (figure 2) is the most widely used concentration method and is normally the first step in the mineral processing sequence where chemical reagents are introduced (Vick 1990).

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

##  Principles of Extractive Metallurgy - Indian Institute of Technology Madras
• Carbothermic reduction of iron ore (Hametite) in blast furnace is a well known process. Overall process is written as: • Ironore oxide mineral + gangue + Reducer (C) + flux + hot blast oxygen enriched air = Pig iron (liquid) + Slag (liquid) + waste gas (CO,CO2,N2) • Iron ore contains Fe2O3, along with gangue materials such as SiO2, Al2O3.
