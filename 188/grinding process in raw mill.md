## Wheat Milling Process - An Introduction - PMG Engineering
Dec 8, 2021Milling is the process by which cereal grains are ground into flour. The milling of Wheat consists in the separation of bran and germ from the endosperm and reduction of endosperm to fine flour. Various steps are involved in making the wheat flour. The traditional procedure for milling wheat in India has been stone grinding to obtain whole

## Cement Manufacturing Process: Raw Grinding Plant
Dry grinding requires approximately 30 % more energy / wt. of ground material. Dry mills need more mill volume than comparable wet mills. However, the increased metal wear of the grinding media and the mill liners for wet grinding, equalizes the additional energy costs of dry grinding procedures ~ 30 - 40 % of wear costs in wet grinding.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
