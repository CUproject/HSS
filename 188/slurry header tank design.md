A device for using the density control water to continuously flush the oxidation air header and the sparge pipes in a flue gas wet scrubber agitation tank. The density control line is routed to the elevation where the control valve is located. A U-shaped trap is located between the control valve and air sparge header such that the density control water joins the humidified oxidation air.

The Slurry-Pulp Distributor is a simple, accurate and positive unit for distributing pulp in a concentrator where-ever it is necessary to split a pulp stream and send equal quantities of material with identical characteristics to several points or circuits for treatment. It is self-rotating and requires no driving mechanism.

Some header tank systems use gravity to push fuel from the main tank through a header tank to the carburetor inlet. Just such a system is used on some versions of the PA-18 Super Cub. Other header tank systems gravity feed fuel to the header tank, and then there is a pump to move the fuel to the inlet of the engine-driven pump.

I have no experience with designing a header tank. Most tanks should be filled from the top, and "feed" fuel or fluid from the bottom. An aircraft header tank will also be vented to both wing tanks, with the vent lines coming from the top of the header tank, vented to the top of the main tanks.

What is a slurry tank? On many farms, slurry (a combination of cow manure and water from washing the milking parlour) is stored in a special tank until it is ready to be applied to the land as fertiliser for plants. At certain times of the year slurry cannot be spread due to weather and environmental conditions.

## Cooling System Header Tanks & Swirl Pots, in Motorsport
Sometimes called a swirl pot, the idea of these is to remove any air from the cooling system. The coolant enters the swirl tank and due to their design, "swirls" around the outside of the inside wall of the tank. As the coolant is heavier it naturally exits the tank at the base to continue its circulation. This then allows any air or steam

## Slurry Pump Capacity & Flow Rates Explained: Sizing Slurry Pump 
A slurry mixture - or mud containing water, bentonite and other additives - is pumped down the drill string.The mud pushes out of the drilling head itself, helping to lubricate the side walls of the bore. This makes it easier for the pipe to slide through the soil. Slurry also maintains a pressure inside the bore to withstand the effects of groundwater pushing in.

Nov 06, 2013. The use of shop-welded steel hopper tanks is common in dry bulk storage applications. Typically, the average size shop-welded tank used to store bulk materials will range from 3500 to 7000 cubic feet per unit. In select applications, shop-welded hopper tanks can exceed capacities of 10,000 cu ft of storage.
