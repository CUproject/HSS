The particle size of 80% ore is between 75-100 microns. And this type of ore has a high grade. Gravity separation and cyanidation is a better process for gold extraction. Because it can recover more than 95% gold. Main gold extraction processes: gravity separation, tailings leaching, deposition extraction, smelting. 3. Gold-bearing quartz vein ore
