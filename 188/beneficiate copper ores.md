## Gravity Separator for Copper Ore---Case of Copper Sulfide From The 
The client expressed on site jigging gravity separation as core pre-separation for copper ore. Copper ore has different types and matures, and most of copper ore cannot be beneficiated by gravity separation, but this jigging gravity cannot work for all copper ores. Ore beneficiation flow sheet is designed according to the ore natures.
