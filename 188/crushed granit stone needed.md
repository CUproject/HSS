For those not familiar, ABC in the Southeast has a composition similar to crushed concrete. My question has to do with the crushed concrete, which is less expensive than crushed run. One plus I see is that it seems to set up even harder than crushed run. This would be a benefit, provided we can get it as smooth as possible before it sets.

## The Pros and Cons of Decomposed Granite Driveways
There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.
