The bubbles condense and the water drained off, leaving a mixture called copper concentrate. The mixture contains 25-35% copper, in addition to copper and iron sulfides and small bits of gold, silver and other matter. The leftover waste—known as tailings or gangue—is pumped into settling ponds to dry.

Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

Also known as crush washers, these compress when tightened to form a tighter, more durable seal than rubber washers. They are commonly used to seal fluids such as oil and fuel. Washers are not reusable.. Copper washers are corrosion resistant in wet environments, nonmagnetic, and electrically conductive.. Aluminum washers are lightweight and corrosion resistant in wet environments.
