## Cone Vs Gyratory Crushers|Mining Equipment
Dec 30, 2012 Cone crusher VS gyratory crusher in mining plant. The Cone crusher is the most new and most economical of all the crushers; The principle of operation of gyratory & cone crusher is almost same; But there are two exceptions. Firstly in Gyratory crusher the outside crushing surface flares in from top to bottom but in Cone crusher it is vice versa.

## Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences
In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are

## cone crusher vs gyratory crusher comparision
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
