## How much sand and gravel is in a cubic Metre of concrete?
As a general rule of thumb, you will need 16 bags of cement (20kg) to go with every cubic metre of concrete blend (1 cubic metre of blend weighs 1.8 Tonne). This equates to roughly 16 mixes in a 2.2 cubic foot mixer, which would be roughly 16-20 barrow loads.

Un-compacted Cloburn aggregates weigh 1.4 tonnes per cubic metre. Therefore if you wish to apply them at a 50mm depth (the normal depth for a driveway) one tonne will cover 14 square metres. For pedestrian pathways, 35mm is normally sufficient in which case 1 tonne will be sufficient to cover approximately 20 square metres.

## Calculating Cement, Sand, and Gravel - Pinoy Builders
Oct 20, 2021Match and calculate sand, gravel, and cement quantities using the concrete proportion table: Volume  Cement Multiplier for a Class "C" in 50 kg bags = 12.5m3  5 = 62.5 bags. The volume of sand is equal to the quantity of sand. For a Class "C" mix, the sand multiplier is 12.5m3 .5 = 6.25m3. Gravel Quantity equals Gravel Volume.

## How Much Sand And Gravel In A Yard Of Concrete? | BagOfConcrete
Mar 27, 2022You need two parts of sand and three parts of gravel (2:3) in a yard of concrete. One part cement, two parts sand, and three parts gravel make up an average 1:2:3 mix. You'd need seven 94-pound bags of cement, half a cubic yard of sand, and a little more than 3/4 cubic yard of gravel to build 1 cubic yard of concrete.
