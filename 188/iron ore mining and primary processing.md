## Iron ore crushing and screening process
Aug 3, 2022The iron ore processing and production process mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is more modern and suitable for high-hardness iron ore crushing and can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the subsequent grinding efficiency.

Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
