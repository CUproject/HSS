Uniform distribution of feed material around the cone crusher inlet is good practice. This allows production of a consistent product, as well as efficient, reliable operation of the crusher. Choke feeding is important for cone crushers because it maintains a good particle shape by facilitating an inter-particle crushing action.

Mar 2, 2021For performance efficiencies, proper circuitry should be designed around the crusher cone, says Schultz. Importantly, the circuit should be engineered to provide the crusher cone with choke-fed material, or enough material to keep the crusher full. Having too little feed can cause the crusher to side load, which stresses components.
