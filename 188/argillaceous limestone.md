## Marl
Marl or marlstone is a carbonate-rich mud or mudstone which contains variable amounts of clays and silt.The term was originally loosely applied to a variety of materials, most of which occur as loose, earthy deposits consisting chiefly of an intimate mixture of clay and calcium carbonate, formed under freshwater conditions. These typically contain 35-65% clay and 65-35% carbonate.

## What is argillaceous limestone? - Fireside Grill and Bar
What is argillaceous stone? Argillaceous minerals are minerals containing substantial amounts of clay-like components (Greek: ἄργιλλος = clay).  Argillaceous minerals may appear silvery upon optical reflection. The adjective "argillaceous" is also used to define rocks in which clay minerals are a secondary but significant component.

## Impact of coating development on the hydraulic and transport properties 
The textural description by image analysis of argillaceous limestone is difficult to obtain with optical microscopy on a thin section because of the fine-grained matrix, the high birefringence of the calcite and dolomite, and the presence of the clay-like phase. For these reasons, observations were made using SEM.

## OR/16/020 Potential hydrocarbon groups - MediaWiki
This unit has a similar lithology (sandstone, limestone and argillaceous rocks). The unit is identified in the north of the Weald Basin through into Norfolk, and thus is identified on the GVS as IOGO-SLAR. Lias Group - mudstone, siltstone, limestone and sandstone. The Lias clays have source rock potential in the Wessex and Weald Basins.

Sep 18, 2022The argillaceous limestone is olive black to olive grey and cryptocrystalline, with no visible porosity and then grades to calcareous claystone. The succession changes at 6011 m with less limestone and more calcareous claystone to 6131 m. At 6131 m, clastics reappear and continue to 6158 m. The 27 m-thick-clastic interval consists of
