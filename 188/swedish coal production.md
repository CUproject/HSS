Virtually all of the country's anthracite coal came from Pennsylvania, and anthracite production dominated the Commonwealth's coal output for most of the nineteenth century. In 1897 western Pennsylvania's bituminous mines surpassed anthracite production. The Keystone state led the nation in mining bituminous coal until the 1930s.
