Jun 12, 2022Indeed, coal's share of global electricity generation has stayed at about 35%, since the mid-1980s. In India, the push for more coal has led the government to give a "special dispensation" to the Ministry of Coal which allows the agency to relax environmental controls and public consultations so mines can produce more coal.
