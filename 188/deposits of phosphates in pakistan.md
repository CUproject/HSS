## phosphorite | Definition, Formation, & Uses | Britannica
phosphorite, also called phosphate rock, rock with a high concentration of phosphates in nodular or compact masses. The phosphates may be derived from a variety of sources, including marine invertebrates that secrete shells of calcium phosphate, and the bones and excrement of vertebrates. The thickest deposits of phosphorite form in areas characterized by carbonaceous shale and chert.

## Phosphorus ion symbolofy
Phosphorus is a chemical element with atomic number 15 which means there are 15 protons in its nucleus. Total number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number of the atom and is given the symbol Z. The total electrical charge of the nucleus is therefore +Ze, where e (elementary charge) equals to 1,602 x 10-19 coulombs.
