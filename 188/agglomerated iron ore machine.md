## Iron ore, concentrate, not iron pyrites, agglomerated | OEC
Ranking Iron ore, concentrate, not iron pyrites, agglomerated ranks 3786th in the Product Complexity Index (PCI). Description Iron ore and concentrate are two types of raw materials used to produce steel. Iron ore is a mixture of iron oxides and silicates. Concentrate is a higher quality type of ore that contains less than 63% iron.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## HSN Code - : AGGLOMERATED IRON ORE AND CONCENTRATES
Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN Codes) are used for the AGGLOMERATED IRON ORE AND CONCENTRATES products under Goods and Service Tax classification. India was originally using 6 digit HSN codes to classify commodities but later two more digits were added to make the codes more precise, resulting in an 8 digit classification.
