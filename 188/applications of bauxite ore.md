1. Introduction. A large quantity of residues is generated in the refinery process of alumina from bauxite ores. It is estimated that 1-1.5 t of bauxite ore residues are generated per ton of alumina and approximately 90 Mt bauxite ore residues are produced annually in the world .The bauxite ore residue is a kind of industrial waste and always stockpiled on land after dehydration.

Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

Types of Bauxite Ore. In 1951, Vadasz classified bauxite into lateritic bauxites and karst bauxites. Lateritic bauxites-Also known as silicate bauxites, these were formed due to the lateralization of various silicate rocks such as granite, gneiss, basalt, and shale.The formation of these bauxites is heavily dependent on intense weathering conditions in a location with excellent drainage.

## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum. - Geology
Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide
