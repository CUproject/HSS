A cyclone is a device that uses centrifugal forces to classify solid particles, in a liquid stream, by size and/or density. What does a Cyclone do? If a cyclone is fed with a sand and water mixture containing a range of particle sizes, most of the fine sand will report to the overflow (the top of the cyclone), together with most of the water.
