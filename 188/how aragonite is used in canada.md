Aragonite is an important CaCO3 polymorph in carbonate sediments, forming both inorganically as early marine cement and biogenically as a skeletal phase. Ca 2 + exists in orthorhombic (ninefold) coordination in the aragonite lattice, allowing aragonite to accept larger cations such as Ba 2 + and Sr 2 +. Aragonite is more soluble than calcite

Aragonite not only dissolves and reforms in water, it is also used by many organisms internally. A closed system, such as an aquarium, can go for a couple of years with a steady pH level provided by aragonite and then start to drop rapidly. The fix for this is to discard the old aragonite and recharge the system with a fresh aragonite substrate.

## Aragonite
Aragonite. Aragonite is a calcium carbonate mineral (like limestone) that comes from seashells. It is used in lieu of lime in situations where the soil is already high in magnesium, and where dolomite (high magnesium limestone) is the only liming material available. Aragonite has approximately 94-97 percent of the neutralizing value of CaCO 3 .

## What is Oolitic Aragonite? — Calcean Minerals & Materials LLC
Oolitic aragonite is one of the world's only biogenic and naturally precipitated calcium carbonates and happens extensively in The Bahamas. These whitings events happen bi-annually, constantly replenishing the oolitic aragonite deposits. The oolitic aragonite reserves on The Bahamas banks are estimated to contain 50 to 100 billion metric tons.

Aragonite's hardness is too low for this stone to be worn safely in jewelry. Avoid mechanical cleaning such as steam or ultrasonic processes. Instead, use a soft brush, mild detergent, and warm water
