## Advantages and disadvantages of flotation method for minerals
Flotation is an efficient method for separating minerals. The development of various flotation medicaments and the specific use in production practice, as well as the new development of flotation technology, have greatly improved the efficiency of flotation and expanded the scope of application of flotation; due to the increase in the types of flotation equipment, the equipment continues Newer

## what is direct flotation in mineral processing
Flotation as applied to mineral processing is a process of concentration of finely divided ores in which the valuable and worthless minerals are completely separated from each other. Concentration takes place from the adhesion of some species of solids to air bubbles and wetting of the other series of solids by water.

Flotation is an important technique in mineral processing, where it is used to separate different types of ores. When used to separate solid-solid mixtures, the material is ground to a particle size small enough to liberate particles of the chemical species to be recovered.
