## The making of glass fiber | CompositesWorld
The glass fiber process. Textile-grade glass fibers are made from silica (SiO 2) sand, which melts at 1720°C/3128°F.SiO 2 is also the basic element in quartz, a naturally occurring rock. Quartz, however, is crystalline (rigid, highly ordered atomic structure) and is 99% or more SiO 2.If SiO 2 is heated above 1200°C/2192°F then cooled ambiently, it crystallizes and becomes quartz.

## 2 Common Glass Manufacturing Methods: Batch and Continuous Melting
Batch Glass Melting Process. In a batch process, all raw materials are added at one time, as opposed to being continually fed into a furnace. The glass is melted in a single vessel or furnace, which is sometimes called a "day tank." Once the glass is melted, a portion of the glass is removed from the melting vessel and is formed into a product.

There are many other types of specialty glass formulae, using ingredients other than lead or lime.
