Different kinds of limestone are added to soil to raise its pH. Generally, the best lime to add to lawns is calcitic pelleted lime. Aim for lime with almost 100% calcium carbonate equivalence. Pelleted lime is the easiest to apply since pulverized lime is extremely fine and might be affected by strong winds.

## Benefits of Applying Agricultural | Agriculture Lime Uses
Limestone can be used to correct the soil's pH level. What Is Agricultural Lime? In order to counter the high acidity of the soil, certain soil amendments can be added to raise the pH levels and neutralize the acidic soil. Agricultural lime is the most effective soil amendment for raising pH levels in order to improve crop health and production.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
