## How does a conventional oven work? - 2022 Bronnie Bakes
Mar 19, 2022Conventional ovens are generally very easy to operate and clean. A conventional oven uses convection heating to evenly distribute heat throughout the oven cavity. Convection ovens circulate hot air around the oven cavity, which helps to ensure even baking. Conventional ovens typically have two racks, but some newer models have three or four.

## How do conventional rockets work? - Qualitative Reasoning Group
Basically, the rocket is pushed forward because material is streaming out of the back of it. Most conventional rockets work through superheated gasses being pushed out of the back of them. These gasses are formed by burning fuel in the presence of oxygen, or another substance called an oxidizer that allows burning to happen.

High capacity thickeners work on a broadly similar principle to conventional thickeners. By the correct use of high molecular weight, fast-acting flocculants, however, large flocs that sediment very quickly can be generated to allow thickeners with high solids handling capacities and relatively small floor areas to be produced.

A rotary drum thickener (RDT) is based on the same principle as a gravity belt thickener (GBT), in that water drains from the sludge through a retaining porous medium. For an RDT the porous medium is the cylindrical wall of a 0.5−1.5 m diameter drum which rotates at speeds between 5 and 20 RPM while the sludge continually passes through it.

Gravity thickener designs usually include circular tanks, 3-4 m (10-13 ft) deep and up to 25 m (82 ft) in diameter. The dimensions are based on prediction of settling due to gravity alone. To assist solids transport, gravity thickener bottoms are constructed with a floor slope between 1:6 and 1:3.
