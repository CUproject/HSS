Use of Quarry Dust to Replace Sand in Concrete - An. Two grades of concrete M20 and M25 having nominal mix proportion of 1:1.5:3 and 1:1:2 respectively were used by weight and w/c ratio was fixed according to the slump requirement of 60mm. For this concrete mix, quarry dust was added for replacement of sand from 0% to 100% in step of 10%

3. Concrete Sand. Concrete sand consists of granite rock, gneiss, or limestone. This sand has angular granules and works best when mixed with cement. Besides usage in concrete, concrete sand can also be used in bedding pipes. This type of sand is usually crushed in a quarry and filtered severally to remove huge fragments and large rocks.
