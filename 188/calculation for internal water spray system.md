JK Cement Works GOTAN. Cement grinding is considered 50% for internal grinding of the clinker produced by this proposed plant and remaining 50 % clinker will be outsourced to grinding Unitsclinker temperature and the other reasons could be insufficient mill venting and insufficient or faulty water spray system Strategy to fix the issue Feed mill with moderately hot (50-80
