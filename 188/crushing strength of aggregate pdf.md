Aggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also. Angular aggregates have a lower ACV, than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength, will give a higher MPa value. It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab. So it is hard to corelate

The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## Aggregate: Mechanical Properties of Aggregate | Concrete Technology
The aggregate shall be taken as in the case of crushing strength value test i.e., the aggregate should pass through 12.5 mm I.S. sieve and retained on 10 mm I.S. sieve. It should be oven dried at 100°C to 110°C for four hours and then air cooled before test.
