## Nigeria legalises artisanal mining in effort to generate $500m in 
NIGERIA has passed legislation making artisanal gold mining legal in a development the country hopes will generate $500m a year in royalties and taxes and create 250,000 jobs.. Citing Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, Reuters said gold buying areas would also be created as well as tax trade of the precious metal. "These operations will help in diversifying our revenue base," said Buhari.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.
