## Gold Extraction & Recovery Processes - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A big plant will determine the effect of a gravity circuit on the plant gold distribution. In this way, the gravity circuit must improve the plant payment for gold.  Amalgamation is one of the oldest methods of extracting gold from its ores. The amalgamation of gold possibly dates from Roman times.  For gold extraction the strength of

## How do you extract gold?idegrillandbar
What chemicals are used to extract gold? A process called "Cyanidation", or cyanide leaching, has been the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s. In this process sodium cyanide, in a dilute solution of ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm or 0.01% to 0.05% cyanide, is used to selectively dissolve gold from ore.

## Gold Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The effect of pH value on gold extraction for various ore types is shown in Figure 28.4. Greatly increasing pH value has a beneficial effect on gold extraction for both oxide and sulfide ores and stabilizes ∼pH 9.5-10.0, whereas for some carbonaceous ores, pH value has no apparent effect. However, the outcome will vary depending on the
