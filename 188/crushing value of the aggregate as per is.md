## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Learning Technology
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions. Aggregates with lower crushing value

##  Effect of Recycled Coarse Aggregate Treatment Using Cement - Sodium 
This result was similar to the report of Radevi´cetal. [8]. The crushing value of RCA treated by the slurry with 4 and 6% NaHCO. 3 (N4 and N6, respectively) was nearly the same (i.e., 10.0 and 9.9%, respectively). The improvements of water absorption and crushing value of the treated RCA were due to the CaCO. 3
