Windmills use an enormous amount of copper. For example, a single wind turbine can contain 335 tons of steel, 4.7 tons of copper, 3 tons of aluminum and 700-plus pounds of rare earth minerals. In fact, wind and solar energy use more copper than conventional forms of energy, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants.

About 80% of the water used at the mine is recycled and re-used. The rest is lost to evaporation and used to keep haul roads damp to minimize dust. After a tailings dam is decommissioned, the tailings are capped with dirt and treated with manure for grazing cows or amended with biosolids (sludge) from a local waste water treatment plant.
