## Soil Compaction: The First Step of a Solid Foundation - AFT 
Proper soil compaction can minimize or eliminate these potential problems by giving the soil higher resistance and stability. The first step in proper soil compaction is to determine whether the soil is cohesive or non-cohesive soil. It is imperative to get a soils report from a licensed engineer to understand the soil conditions of the project.

## Deep ripping for soil compaction | Agriculture and Food
Deep ripping mechanically breaks up compacted soil layers, however care must be taken to ensure results are effective. Deep ripping uses strong tines working down to 35-50cm depth to loosen hard layers of soil. Tine spacing, working depth, shallow leading tines or discs, soil moisture content, timing and soil type all need to be taken into account.

## Soil compaction | UMN Extension - University of Minnesota
What is compaction? Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, reducing pore space between them (Figure 1). Heavily compacted soils contain few large pores, less total pore volume and, consequently, a greater density. A compacted soil has a reduced rate of both water infiltration and drainage. This happens because large pores more effectively move water downward through

Fill is defined as placing material to raise the elevation of an area. Compaction must take place during a fill operation to increase the density of the soil material being placed. Another common breakdown in excavation work is bulk excavation and trench excavation. Swell and shrinkage are two important, and often misunderstood, terms.

On many athletic fields the compaction is limited to the top one or two inches (25 to 50 mm) of the soil. The best method to alleviate compaction is hollow-tine aerification and knowing the compacted areas so they can be given extra care. The relationship between soil compaction, soil texture and root growth is shown in Table 2.

Compaction machines. Compaction machines apply forces to increase soil density. Some equipment applies only static forces, which include pressure and kneading produced only by the dead weight and configuration of the machine itself. Such static forces affect only the top layers of material, and their impact is felt only to a limited depth.
