## Mercury element extraction, mining technique - flotation, jigging 
This mineral is found almost everywhere and generally occurs in all types of rocks, also in combination with gold, iron and zinc. Apart from this, there are 25 other minerals from which mercury is obtained. Highly mechanized mining techniques are followed for the mining the mercury-containing -ores.

Mining has been a part of the Earth's history since prehistoric times. Mining has played a role throughout the millennia - from Neanderthals' use of stone, to ancient Egyptians', Greeks', Romans' and Incans' more sophisticated mining processes and uses of mined materials. From the Industrial Age and the ability of mass production, societies' progress has led to our Modern times

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## Gold Mining Process
Nov 1, 2021Miners use heavy mining machinery to drill wide steps known as benches, which separate the rock containing gold (ore) from the rock with no economic quantities of gold (waste). Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles.

They were first commercially produced in the 1880s when they were mined in Sweden and Norway. The first foreign production was in Brazil in 1887, and India began producing them in 1911. From 1940 to 1990, the United States produced and mined its own rare earth minerals. Mountain Pass mine in California was the biggest resource in the country.

The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

The minerals on Federal lands are divided into three categories, each subject to different laws and regulations. Locatable, which are subject to the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, include gold, silver, copper and other hard rock minerals. Leasable minerals, such as coal and a host of other commodities, are subject to various Mineral Leasing Acts.

Mineral processing is a form of extractive metallurgy that separates valuable minerals from the ore into a concentrated, marketable product. Mineral processing is also known as mineral dressing. Mineral processing is conducted at the site of the mine and is a highly mechanical process, with oversight from a central control room.
