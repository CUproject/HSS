## The Complete Guide To Calculating Total Manufacturing Costs
Sep 1, 2020September 1, 2020. 8 Minute Read. To calculate total manufacturing cost you add together three different cost categories: the costs of direct materials, direct labour and manufacturing overheads. Expressed as a formula, that's: Total manufacturing cost = Direct materials + Direct labour + Manufacturing overheads. That's the simple version.
