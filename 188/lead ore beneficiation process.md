Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total

## Lead-zinc ore crushing and grinding process - SBM Ultrafine Powder 
Jun 10, 2022The processing and production process of lead-zinc ore mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is a more modern method suitable for the crushing of high-hardness lead-zinc ore, which can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation

##  Benefication of Lead & Zinc Ores
Usually lead sulphides are selectively floated from the ore followed by activation and separation of zinc in case of complex lead-zinc ores. Bulk flotation followed by separation of lead and zinc differential flotation is not quite uncommon. Table 3.5 at the end of this chapter, summarizes the benefication results of lead & zinc Ores studies.

## Beneficiation
For sulfide ores, a different process is taken for beneficiation. The ore needs to have the sulfur removed before smelting can begin. Roasting is the primary method of separating, where wood was placed on heaps of ore and set on fire to help with oxidation. 2 Cu 2 S + 3 O 2 → 2 Cu 2 O + 2 SO 2

## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
Usually, lead is found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a multi-step process. First the lead ore is ground into small particles that are less than 0.1mm, giving the ore a texture similar to table salt.
