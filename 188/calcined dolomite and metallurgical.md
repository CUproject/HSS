## Calcined Dolomite: An Efficient and Recyclable Catalyst for Synthesis 
Abstract. Calcined dolomite was utilized as a low-cost and efficient catalyst for the Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes with active methylene compounds such as malononitrile and ethyl cyanoacetate to afford substituted α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.Calcination temperature was an important variable which changed the surface areas, textural characteristics and basicity of dolomite

## Calcined Dolomite - Algyr
Calcined Dolomite. The mineral dolomite with the chemical formula -Camg (Co3) 2- has a complete occurrence in three directions. Most dolomites are found in creamy gray and grayish white, but some have been found in other colors such as white, yellow, green, and black. Stones containing dolomite are also known as dolomite or dolomite limestone.

## CalDolit - Calcined dolomite
Calcium and magnesium oxide or calcined dolomite are obtained from dolomitic minerals such as calcium carbonate and magnesium CaMg(CO3)2, through the calcination process. SINTERED DOLOMITE. Sinter dolomite is made by heating the raw dolomite at a temperature which is higher than 1650 deg C and preferably exceeding 1800 deg C. It is used for

## High-temperature studies of metallurgical processes. Part II. The 
The thermal conductivities of calcined dolomite/silicon metal mixtures, of the type used in the production of magnesium, were measured at 750 to 1150°C with compaction pressures of 67 to 185 MPa
