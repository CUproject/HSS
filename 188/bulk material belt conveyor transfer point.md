## Dust at conveyor transfer points and air velocity - Martin Eng
Enlarged settling zones can slow air and allow dust to settle back to the conveyor. An effectively designed transfer chute reduces the air velocity by minimizing air drawn into the transfer point, sealing the leaks that allow dust-bearing air to escape and allowing the dust time to settle out of the air. The traditional transfer-point enclosure is the most common method used to combat dust.

The Radial Stacker is portable and pivots around the inlet point. Bulk materials discharge off the end of the belt and create a pile. As the pile grows in height, the Radial Stacker pivots around the inlet point and distributes the material in a radius. Capacities up to 20,000 cubic feet per hour can easily be handled with Kase Radial Stackers.

 Belt conveyors and associated transfer points are two of the most common areas where fugitive dust emissions pose a challenge to bulk material handling and processing operations. There are TyPiCally 2 main PoinTs of dusT CreaTion 1. The drop or discharge pointwhich contains particles that are too light to fall down into the process.

Belt conveyors and associated transfer points are one of the most common areas where dust emissions pose a challenge to bulk material handling and processing operations. Typically the material drop or discharge point and material impact point are where dust is generated. DSI DryFog Dust Suppression systems address both areas of dust creation.

If enclosing the transfer point is not an option, then increasing the size of the particles of dust to make them heavier and more prone to dropping from the airflow may be the solution. Increasing the size of the particles of dust will make the dust particles heavier. A heavier particle will not be so easily picked up by air movement, and it

Conveyor transfer chutes deposit material onto a belt conveyor. This material might be delivered by truck and dropped into a hopper above the chute, but most are used for belt-to-belt transfers. A belt-to-belt transfer chute is fed material from the upper conveyor. Typically, material waterfalls off the belt into the head chute compartment.

## Bulk Handling Conveyors |Bulk Material Handling
The Rapat Bulk Handling Series CU (car unloader) Conveyor in the answer for bulk materials such as grains, beans, sand, and much more. It is built for rugged use, being able to handle up to 90 lbs. of material per hour on a 24-inch belt, and 120 lbs. per hour on a 30-inch belt. The Series CU conveyor is equipped with a wheeled undercarriage for

## Foundry: Conveyor Transfer Point Re-engineered :: Airmatic
Solution. Following CEMA® guidelines and using the MARTIN® FOUNDATIONS™ SOTA approach to belt conveyors, AIRMATIC Application Specialists determined the transfer point needed to be re-engineered to cleanly transfer the sand. The first step was to remove the existing chute. Then, AIRMATIC extended the tail end of the receiving belt by four feet.
