## Bauxite & Alumina Market Overview - Sierraminbauxite
Bauxite is the primary source of Aluminium. The global market continues to grow with global production rising from 137mt in 2001 to 229mt in 2014. Sierra Leonean production makes up just less than 1 % of this volume. Substantial reserves of bauxite are already proven. Sierra Leone has 1 billion tones of estimated bauxite resources.

The first step in producing aluminium is mining this ore. Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Australia. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, with five large mines supplying around 30 per cent of global production. Bauxite mining has five steps:

Bauxite is formed over millions of years by chemical weathering of rocks containing aluminum silicates, producing an ore rich in aluminum oxide. Today, bauxite is mined primarily in Africa, Australia and the Caribbean. Step 2: Refining alumina. The ore is ground and mixed with lime and caustic soda, then heated in high-pressure containers.

Primary aluminum production begins with the mining of bauxite ore, a hydrated oxide of aluminum consisting of 30 to 56 percent alumina (A l2O3) and lesser amounts of iron, silicon, and titanium. The ore is refined into alumina by the Bayer process. The alumina is then shipped to a primary aluminum plant for electrolytic reduction to aluminum.

ALUMINA PRODUCTION. Bauxite is crushed, dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water. This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites. The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime-caustic soda.

## Why is bauxite used for the extraction of aluminum?
Aluminium ore is called bauxite .  Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2000°C) so it would be expensive to melt it.Aluminium oxide does not dissolve in water, but it does dissolve in molten cryolite. This is an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide.
