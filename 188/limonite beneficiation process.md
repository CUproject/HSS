## Limonite
Limonite (/ ˈ l aɪ m ə ˌ n aɪ t /) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)· n H 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely.

## Manganese Ore Beneficiation | Manganese Ore Processing Plant - JXSC Machine
The purpose of manganese ore beneficiation is to remove the slime, separate stone and mineral manganese, enrich the low-grade ore, improve the ore grade, reduce the energy and reagent consumption of the smelting process from the source, and then reduce the amount of smelting waste. The methods of mineral manganese processing mainly include
