## Dissolved air flotation » Ecologix Systems
Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process that clarifies wastewaters (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids. The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank

## Understanding the Basics of Dissolved Air Flotation - P.E.W.E.
In its simplest, least complex terms, the technology and methods behind dissolved air flotation are outlined in its name. DAF uses dissolved air to raise unwanted solid particles to the surface of a tank. Tiny air bubbles force suspended solids to the water's surface, where they can be removed more easily.

## Dissolved Air Flotation Process in Wastewater Treatment
Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process designed to remove oils, solids, and greases. In fact, the process helps clarify wastewaters - and other waters - by eliminating different types of suspended matter. The DAF process dissolves air in the water under pressure - then releases it at atmospheric pressure.

## Dissolved Air Flotation System (DAF) | Hoffland Environmental, Inc 
This HEI dissolved air system is much more effective than an induced air system. System Design Criteria. There are five important factors to be considered in properly sizing a DAF system: 1. Air to Solids Ratio is the quantity of air required to float a given amount of solids and FOG's. It usually is expressed as lbs. of air/lb. of solids
