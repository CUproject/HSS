In August of 1997, the J. R. Simplot Company partnered with the University of Idaho to investigate selenium releases from its Smoky Canyon phosphate mine in Idaho. Site sampling provided collection of water from up- and down-gradient of mine-affected areas as well as collection of mine overburden samples for characterization.
