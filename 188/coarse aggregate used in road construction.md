Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.

## Aggregate sand and gravelmadourfo
A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that hardens, hardens and adheres to other materials to join them together.Cement is rarely used on its own, but to bond sand and gravel . The cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete..

## A Study on Replacement of Coarse Aggregate with Recycled Concrete 
For this purpose, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% amounts of recycled concrete (RC) aggregates were used in SCC instead of limestone coarse aggregates. RC aggregate was used in SCC mixtures after 24 hours
