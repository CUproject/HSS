## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

Oct 4, 2020The size of the final product you may expect is between the range of 35 mm to 350 mm. This means the final product size is even finer than those of the product of jaw crusher. The cone can also crush almost all the materials which you can crush with the jaw crusher. The cone crusher can be used in many fields just like the jaw crusher.

## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

The vibrating feeder feeds materials to the jaw crusher for essential crushing. At that point, the yielding material from the jaw crusher is moved to a cone crusher for optional crushing, and afterward to effect for the third time crushing. As part of next process, the squashed quartz is moved to a vibrating screen for sieving to various sizes.

Compared with the impact crushers, jaw crushers use the compression force to break down materials. When the material is poured into the chamber and fall though chamber, it will be crushed 2 to 4 times. The reduction ratio of this machine is about 6:1. Besides the higher reduction ratios, the impact crushers is more useful to make a more cubical
