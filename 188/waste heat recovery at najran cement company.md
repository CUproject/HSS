## Waste Heat Recovery | TLV - A Steam Specialist Company (Worldwide)
Steam Thermocompression. Thermocompression is another heat recovery approach that can utilize the energy in an otherwise wasted stream, such as low-pressure steam. This is the process of mixing high-pressure and low-pressure steam to create an intermediate pressure using steam compression equipment such as TLV's SC System, which is shown below.

Waste heat minimisation and recovery is a significant opportunity to improve efficiency and reduce energy bills. It can also mean lower maintenance costs and improved equipment productivity as energy-using equipment can be operated less intensely. There are often numerous opportunities in older buildings and plants to implement heat recovery
