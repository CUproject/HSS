## effect of limestone binder in iron ore pellets
Jul 10, 2017· Bentonite, an inorganic binder, has been the main binder used in the iron ore pelletizing process since the beginning of pellet production in the 1950s. Bentonite promotes the formation of ceramic bridges between particles, which can minimize the number of pellets that collapse during firing.

## Uses Of Dolomite I Iron Ore Pellets Process
Steel pellets are made from iron ore powder with additives such as limestone, dolomite, olivine and binder bentonite.Iron ore pellets is well known since a few years, and it has been widely used in the DR process to reduce the clustering of direct reduced iron, DRI, in DR shaft furnaces.3) In the DR processes the product is freshly reduced iron
