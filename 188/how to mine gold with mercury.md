The price of mercury is affected by a wide range of factors including but not limited to: The price of gold in the free market because small-scale gold mining uses mercury in processing the precious metal. Basically, the higher the gold prices, the higher the mercury prices although there are also exceptions to the rule of thumb.

After gold and mercury form an amalgam, the glittery substance is heated in open pots to drive off the mercury as toxic vapor. The solution was to make a simple retort -- a cap with a metal tube -- that traps the mercury vapors and guides them into a vessel full of water, where they condense back into liquid mercury.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury

How Mercury Is Used in Gold Mining . First, mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold.
