## Photos: How war has devastated Ukraine's coal industry - CNN
Feb 6, 2022Ukraine was once Europe's third-largest coal producer. But production has dropped dramatically since 2014, when fighting broke out with pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region.

## Coal Mining Sector To Decline Across Eastern Europe Except Poland
Jan 17, 2022In the short-to-medium term, high levels of coal consumption from Poland's power generation will continue to support the mining industry. In Poland coal represents the largest proportion of total power generation of any country in Europe, with over 70% of its electricity generation coming from coal in 2020.

## Coal in Europe
Coal in Europe describes the use of coal as an energy fuel in Europe. Coal includes hard coal, black coal, and brown coal.  The coal mining industry also has occupational hazards. In the Komi Republic, Russia, at the centre of the mining industry, occupational diseases are five time more prevalent than in the rest of the Russian Federation.

## Poland - Biggest Mining Country in Europe - APCOM
In the mid-18th-century coal mining became prominent. The Silesian coalfields grew into major industrial regions. In east Galicia oil mining developed a bit later. In 1919 a mining academy was established in Cracow with the aim of educating new engineers. Poland's reserves of hard coal are estimated at 45.4 billion tons.

Since 2000, the world has doubled its coal-fired power capacity to around 2,045 gigawatts (GW) after explosive growth in China and India. A further 200GW is being built and 300GW is planned. More recently, 268GW has closed due to a wave of retirements across the EU
