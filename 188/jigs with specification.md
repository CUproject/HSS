The principle of location or the 3-2-1 principle, CAD tools (like ProE), and FEA tools (like ANSYS) are used for the design of the jigs as well as the fixtures. The jig is used for guiding the cutting tool (like a drill bit), and for doing so, jigs have components like a bush, which comes in contact with the cutting tool.

## Jigs and Fixtures - Applications and Difference Between Jigs and 
The jig is used for guiding the cutting tool (like a drill bit), and for doing so, jigs have components like a bush, which comes in contact with the cutting tool. On the other hand, a fixture never comes in direct contact with the cutting tool. Fixtures assure the position and alignment of the work pieces for getting the required machining

##  UNIT 3 DESIGN OF JIGS Design of Jigs
3.2.2 Design Consideration in Jigs (a) The main frame of jig must be strong enough so that the deflection of jig is as minimum as possible. This deflection of jig is caused due to the forces of cutting, clamping of the workpiece or clamping to the machine table. The mainframe of the jig should have the mass to prevent vibration and chatter.
