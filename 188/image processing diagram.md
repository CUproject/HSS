## Nucleolus
The nucleolus (/ n uː-, nj uː ˈ k l iː ə l ə s,-k l i ˈ oʊ l ə s /, plural: nucleoli /-l aɪ /) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is best known as the site of ribosome biogenesis, which is the synthesis of ribosomes.The nucleolus also participates in the formation of signal recognition particles and plays a role in the cell's response to stress.

## Explain Bit Plane Slicing Techniques in Image Processing
Sep 7, 2022The three main goals of bit plane slicing is: Converting a gray level image to a binary image. Representing an image with fewer bits and corresponding the image to a smaller size. Enhancing the image by focussing. Since the given image has a maximum grey level of 7, it is a 3-bit image. We convert the image to binary and separate the bit planes.

## Image Acquisition in Digital Image Processing - Buzztech
Digital Image Processing. In image processing, it is defined as the action of retrieving an image from some source, usually a hardware-based source for processing. It is the first step in the workflow sequence because, without an image, no processing is possible. The image that is acquired is completely unprocessed.

## Digital Image Processing Introduction
Signal processing is a discipline in electrical engineering and in mathematics that deals with analysis and processing of analog and digital signals, and deals with storing, filtering, and other operations on signals. These signals include transmission signals, sound or voice signals, image signals, and other signals e.t.c.

Inside an Image Sensor: Our basic understanding of image sensors can be summarized as: "Light travels through a lens, the shutter opens, and a moment is preserved by capturing it on the camera's sensor". The basic building blocks of an image sensor are photodiodes which perform the conversion of light. Figure 1: Principle of Image Sensor.

## Fundamental Steps in Digital Image Processing - Buzztech
Fig: Fundamental steps in digital image processing. 1. Image Acquisition: In image processing, it is defined as the action of retrieving an image from some source, usually a hardware-based source for processing. It is the first step in the workflow sequence because, without an image, no processing is possible.
