Jaw crusher is used as primary crusher, it's reduction ratio is usually 6:1. It uses compressive force to break the material, this mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher. It is called a jaw crusher because it works the same was a human jaw does-food goes into your mouth and your bottom jaw pushes the food up against

## What is jaw crusher used for? - Sandrock Mining
Mar 29, 2021Jaw crusher is an earlier crushing equipment.Because of its simple structure, sturdiness, reliable work, easy maintenance and repair, and relatively low production and construction costs, it is still widely used in metallurgy, chemical industry, building materials, electric power, For transportation and other industrial sectors, it is used for coarse, medium and fine crushing of various ores

## Blake Jaw Crusher - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The original Blake crusher was de­signed with a vertical stationary jaw. Probably the first departure from this arrangement was an 84 X 66″ crusher, built in 1914. This machine con­ventional design, in that the swing jaw was made vertical. Later, when the Superior line was developed, a compromise between these two ex­tremes was used in
