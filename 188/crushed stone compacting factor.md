## Crushed Stone Compacting Factor
Crushed Stone Compacting Factor. Each type of crushed stone will settle at a different rate and will have a different compaction rate. As a result various materials will need to be compacted down more heavily than others. Depending on the specific project you may end up requiring 12″-1 12″ of extra material in order to achieve the desired

The 1-2" of Base material should be tightly compacted using a hand tamper or plate compactor. The slope should be about 1/4" per one foot of distance. It is helpful to pull a string line so you can check your slope. To run a string line, put two landscape stakes in the ground. Tie a piece of string to one of them, then pull it tight to the other.

## How is soil compaction with crushed stone?
The crushed stone compaction factor is used to calculate the exact amount of a given building material. Moreover, this value also depends on the type of crushed stone fraction. The crushed stone compaction coefficient is a number that shows the degree of reduction in the volume of crushed stone during transportation or tamping.

## compaction factor for crushed limestone
By the level of frost resistance, crushed stone can be divided into stable, unstable and highly resistant; compaction factor - the density of crushed stone ranges from 1.2 to 3 g / cm³. This coefficient depends on the type of origin of the material.Crushed stone with a high degree of density is universal and has unlimited scope of application.

The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size. Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous. I would use a safe 36 degrees unless a direct shear test is performed on a sample. There's at-rest earth pressure and active earth pressure.
