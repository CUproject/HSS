## How do you deliver sustainable alumina refinery cost reduction
Alumina refineries must continually improve to remain competitive. However, the complexity of the refining process and its associated plant and equipment presents a challenge to sustain any cost reduction. Additionally, improvement gains must be achieved while the refinery asset ages over time and often with declining bauxite feedstock quality.

Analysts are all in agreement that expanding an existing Alumina Refinery reduces the investment cost per ton of alumina by as much as 40%. For this reason, a completely new Alumina Refinery was last built in 1984. Increases in demand for alumina over the twenty(20) year period have been met exclusively by expansion in installed plant capacities.
