## Difference Between Metallic and Non-metallic Minerals
Metallic Minerals is composed of metals in their original form, whereas no metals are found in non-metallic minerals. Minerals possess a definite chemical structure, and their identification is based on their physical properties. The place where minerals are found is called an ore. Ores are the concentration of any mineral with other elements
