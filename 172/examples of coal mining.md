## U.S. Waterways Polluted by Coal Mining - Environmental Pollution Centers
In the United States, coal power plants release over 100 million tons of coal ash each year with only a third of it being recycled in some way, for example, by incorporating it into concrete. The rest of the waste, however, is deposited in mines that are no longer active, in landfills or, as it is mostly the case, in hazardous ponds.

Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.
