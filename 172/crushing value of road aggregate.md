Aggregate crushing value = (W1/W2)100. A value less than 10 signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate while above 35 would normally be regarded as weak aggregates.  The specific gravity of aggregates normally used in road construction ranges from about 2.5 to 2.9. Water absorption values ranges from 0.1 to about 2.0 percent for aggregates

##  Aggregate Crushing Value
With aggregate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher, the result may be anomalous, and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead. 2.Apparatus Required Fig. 1: Balance Balance should be accurate upto 1 gm. Fig. 2: Sieve (12.5 mm, 10.0 mm and 2.36 mm)

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Determine Aggregate Crushing Value
Jan 21, 2022Aggregates with a lower crushing value have a lower crushed fraction under load, giving the road a longer service life and thus a more economical performance. If we used a weaker material, it would be crushed under traffic loads, resulting in smaller pieces that were not coated with a binder and would be easily displaced or loosened out
