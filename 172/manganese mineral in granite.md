The enrichment of manganese in peraluminous (S-type) granitic melts beginning with the anatexis of metapelitic rock and ending with the crystallization of highly evolved pegmatites is explained using experimentally derived mineral-melt partition coefficients and solubility data for Mn-rich garnet.

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ɪ t / (UK) or / ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t / (US) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.
