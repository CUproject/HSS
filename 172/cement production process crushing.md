## limestone mining, limestone crushing, limestone processing production line
Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture.  Step 2: Limestone crushing. Most of the limestone rocks mined from the mine by blasting have large particle sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to use limestone crushers to crush

## Crushing Technology for Reducing Emissions in Cement Mines
Dec 24, 2021Mixed crushing is often used in cement production. Therefore, mixed crushing generally refers to a production process in which two raw materials are sent to a crusher in a certain proportion in cement production for crushing. Common types of mixed crushing include limestone and marl, limestone and shale, limestone and clay, etc.

Raw materials of the cement plant are mostly from open-pit mines, and the ore size of large mines can reach 1.5-1.8m. In the preparation of cement raw materials, we first need to crush limestone, gypsum, clay and other materials into proper size to facilitate the subsequent transportation and storage, at the same time make full preparations for the next process (cement raw materials grinding).
