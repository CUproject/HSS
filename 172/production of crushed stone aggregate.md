## Sustainability in Midwestern Crushed Stone Aggregate Production
During the 19th century, lime and building stone were the main stone products used in the region and the industry was able to convert to crushed stone aggregates after 1900. Since then, both regions have experienced similar increasing production trends that have greatly reduced their long-term reserves of aggregate resources.

Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
