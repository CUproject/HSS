## Who is hematite formed? Explained by FAQ Blog
What is the difference between hematite and magnetic hematite? Manmade hematite is still made out of iron oxide in most cases. Components labeled "magnetic hematite" are typically manmade, and these are even more magnetic than natural hematite, which only has a weak magnetic draw. This form of iron oxide can be naturally magnetic, much more so than hematite.
