These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. Iron ore is normally beneficiated utilizing the

Flotation process and equipment Flotation process is also commonly seen in nowadays iron ore beneficiation. It has become a very important way to recover weak magnetic ore.  It is also used to treat iron ore fine to reduce the content of silica and impurities. Flotation beneficiation separates ore by different physical and chemical
