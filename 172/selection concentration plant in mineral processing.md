Types of Pre-Concentration Technology. There are four basic approaches to pre-concentration: Bulk ore sorting. Heavy medium separation (HMS) Particle ore sorting. Grade Engineering™. Since all ore-handling processes are costly, it is advantageous to carry out pre-concentration as early in the sequence of ore handling and processing as possible.

As main gangue minerals, calcite, dolomite, and some silicates are present in both ore types. Before 1960, the lead-vanadate-containing ore from different ore bodies was processed using gravity concentration. The processing plant for flotation of lead, zinc, and vanadate minerals was introduced by the end of 1961 and closed in 1978.

Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill. In large-scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated. These properties can be colour (optical sorting), density (gravity separation), magnetic or electric (magnetic and electrostatic separation), and

The processing of lithium-containing minerals such as spodumene, in general, comprises crushing, wet grinding in a ball mill, sizing, gravity concentration, and flotation using a fatty acid (oleic acid) as the collector. The major lithium mineral in lithium ore is spodumene, which is considered insoluble in water and dilute acids.
