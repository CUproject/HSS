## The future in cement manufacturing is here: Transforming Cementos 
The cement production process. Cement manufacturing is a process consisted of two major steps with generally similar cycle times: the Mill, which grinds hard clinker to fine powder, and the Kiln, where this powder is heated at 1500⁰C to decarbonize the material [2].  Machine learning can not only improve production process, but can also

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of
