Rapid sand filtration is a highly effective method to remove turbidity if it is correctly applied (BRIKKE & BREDERO 2003). Equally, solids formed during pre-treatment, i.e. coagulation-flocculation, are filtered. A well-operated RSF reduces turbidity to less than 1 NTN and often less than 0.1 NTU (WHO 1996).
