Aug 11, 2021Pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron disulfide mineral containing iron and sulfur. The name fool's gold comes from novice prospectors commonly mistaking it for gold. Pyrite has a brassy sheen, and unlike gold which is malleable, pyrite will crush into a brown powder.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Pyrite: The mineral pyrite information and pictures
Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur, but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron. Pyrite from some localities is auriferous, and therefore is used as an ore of gold in gold-bearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors. Today, it is used as an ornamental stone, as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.

## Pyrite Mining - JXSC Mining
What is Pyrite. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore

Pyrite as an Ore of Gold. The most important use of pyrite is as an ore of gold. Gold and pyrite form under similar conditions and occur together in the same rocks. In some deposits small amounts of gold occur as inclusions and substitutions within pyrite. Some pyrites can contain 0.25% gold by weight or more.
