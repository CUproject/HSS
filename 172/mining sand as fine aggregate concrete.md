Fine aggregate refers to the gravel or crushed stone material whose stone size is less than 5MM used for preparing the concrete. Fine aggregate is also divided into coarse sand, medium sand, fine sand and finer sand, whose fineness modulus is of 3.7 ~ 3.1, 3.0 ~ 2.3, 2.2 ~ 1. 6 and 1.5 ~ 0.7.

With most particles going through a 3/8-inch sieve, fine aggregates typically consist of natural sand or crushed stone. All particles larger than 0.19 inches are coarse aggregates but usually vary between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels make up much of the remaining coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone.

Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.

## Replacement of Sand with Bauxite Mining Waste in Concrete Production 
The use of natural sand as fine aggregate in concrete is becoming problematic due to scarcity and pressure on mining of the resource.  The aim of this study is to examine the possibility of using bauxite mining waste as a fine aggregate replacement for concrete production. The quantities of sand replaced with bauxite mining waste used are 0

Each sand mining company processes sand which is ideal for construction purposes. Building of roads and manufacturing of concrete, all take place due to sand. The production of gravel deposits takes place by natural procedures like erosion and moisture. Gravel are of different types: ¾ " and 1 ½ ", seal, hydraulic base, and subbase.

How fine aggregate affects concrete mix design. Fine aggregate testing is a concoction of various materials which are distributed, refined, and picked after going through thorough analysis through a sieve test. The aggregate must have the right proportion of course and fine agglomeration, for it to be considered fit for use in construction.

Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.

## Mining Sand And Sea Sand As Fine Aggregate In Concrete
Present paper investigates adopting sea sand as fine aggregate in concrete. The physical properties like specific gravity, percentage of fineness and solubility were carried out in raw sea sand and treated sea sand. The results of the study reveal that the chloride level of treated sea sand is below the acceptable level of 0.075 % weight of sand.
