The 3 reactions reflect this. On the LHS (left hand side) of (i) there was a charge of -3; on the RHS, there is also a charge of -3, as required. Now it may seem that chemical reactions are quite complicated, but if you look at them, they will always be balanced; that is they conserve mass and charge.

## Equation Balancer | The best Chemical Equation Calculator
The chemical reaction between Metal and halogens results in the formation of salt. The example is the formation of NaCl such as. 2Na(metal) + Cl 2 (halogen) → 2NaCl(salt) The chemical reaction between acid and base results in the formation of salt and water. It happens due to neutralization reaction such as. HCl + NaOH → NaCL + H 2 O

## 11 Facts on Hcl + H2o :With Several Elements Reaction
The formula of hydrochloric acid is also HCl. Hydrochloric acid then dissociates in water and forms ions. HCl + H2O Type of reaction. Exothermic reaction (as heat is evolved) R eversible chemical reaction (as equilibrium is formed) Ionization Reaction (as ions are formed in the reaction) Conjugate Acid. Has one hydrogen more than the base.

## Oxygen
Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds.Oxygen is Earth's most abundant element, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe.
