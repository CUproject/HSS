Our plants in France and Tunisia produce anhydrous DCP in powder or mini-granules, while the Spanish plant is specialized in powder dihydrated

## Clean process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate 
A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.

## Dicalcium phosphate
Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO 4 and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO 4 2- anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4.It is also known as dibasic calcium phosphate or calcium monohydrogen phosphate.Dicalcium phosphate is used as a food additive, it is found in some

Thus, the process of resorption is classed as cell-mediated (phagocytosis by macrophages) and solution-driven [10,11]. The disintegration of CaP based materials causes particle formation, which leads to CaP resorption via phagocytosis by macrophages.  The thermodynamical solubility of the CaP variations at pH 7 is Dicalcium Phosphate

It is thought that dicalcium phosphate may undergo molecular reorientation to form a non-crystalline amorphous calcium phosphate which acts as an intermediate in the process. Analysis of synthetic amorphous calcium phosphate indicates that it is composed of 1 nm diameter Ca 9 (PO 4 ) 6 clusters which close-pack randomly to form 30-80 nm spheres.

## Dicalcium-Phosphates- Process, Technology, Applications, Patent 
Dicalcium phosphate crystals are precipitated and after filtration and drying the resulting product is a very pure crystalline dihydrate dicalcium phosphate that is sold as Aliphos® Dical. Dicalcium phosphate is obtained from degreased bones which are demineralised by hydrochloric acid treatment and precipitated by a saturated lime solution.

Silica is a common additive in food production ( E551 ), where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to adsorb water in hygroscopic applications. It is used as an anti - caking agent in powdered foods such as spices and non-dairy coffee creamer. It is the primary component of diatomaceous earth.
