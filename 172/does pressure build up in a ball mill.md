## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force, as opposed to the Scotch Tape or sonication that mainly use normal force. Ball mills, like the three roll machine, are a common occurrence in industry, for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process, there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.

5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

## Pressure Canner Troubleshooting - How To Fix Problems
My pressure canner is the normal run of the mill canner: Mine is a Mirro 22, made in 1980.  Pressure escapes and I have to push it straight-up so it will build pressure again. I guess I need to purchase new gaskets.  Please recheck the instructions from the Pressure Canner, or check out Ball Canning Book. Best of luck in your endeavor

## Does pressure build up? - Home Distiller
When you build the still you do so so that there is never a chance that pressure can build up. Obviously that would be dangerous. On mine I drilled a vent hole in the top to let vapor escape if my condenser were to fail.
