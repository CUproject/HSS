## Can You Pour Concrete Over Crushed Concrete? - House Caravan
New concrete can be poured over old concrete as long as it is done properly. About two inches thick of new concrete should be poured. Aside from that, it is recommended to use smaller aggregate and to use reinforcement like fiber into the concrete. If the slab is so thick that it makes it hard to use fiber, you can opt for a steel rebar.

## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

## 3 Reasons to Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs - B & R Sand & Gravel
1. Help Level the Ground. Starting the installation process with a layer of crushed stone helps level the ground and gives you an even surface to work on. Pouring concrete without a firm stone base will cause it to crack and erode over time. The stone layer also helps create a barrier between the slabs and the surrounding plant growth.
