## Pollution Due to Cement Dust - Ijert
Cement industry is one of the17 most polluting industries listed by Central Pollution Control Board in India. During the last decades, the emission of dust from cement factories has been increasing alarmingly due to expansion of more cement plants to meet the growing requirement of cement materials for construction of buildings.

As coal is one of the prime raw material used in cement production, this seems to be a positive move. Growth potential of cement industry can be judged by the fact that the per capita cement consumption (156 kg) in India is still well below the global average consumption (396 kg). This gap can be expected to be covered in the coming years.

## Distribution Channels for the Cement Industry
Feb 28, 2022The Government of India's spend on infrastructure is already providing a necessary stimulus to the cement industry. A key example would be the government's Gatishakti project with a commitment to 1.4 crores housing under the affordable housing scheme for which a spend Rs 1.47 lakh crore is expected on infrastructure.

## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
The main materials used in cement production are minerals containing calcium oxide, silex, alumina and iron oxide. These components are rarely found in one type of raw material; therefore, for the cement production the raw mix is selected for the following components: CARBONATE COMPONENT (rich in calx) is contained in the raw mix in a quantity

## The Growth of Cement Industry in India- Insights Success
India's overall cement production capacity was nearly four hundred and sixty million tonnes as of . Its consumption is expected to grow by five percent in the financial year of 2019 supported by a pick-up in the housing segment and higher infrastructure spending. Currently, the industry is planning to produce three hundred megatons in

## Bigger Climate Action Emerging in Cement Industry | UNFCCC
UN Climate Change News, Bonn, Oct 26 - The global cement industry is taking increasing climate action, encouraged by changes in policy, technology and new opportunities to raise profits and cut costs through reducing greenhouse gas emissions.. The full and willing participation of a sector which accounts for 5-6% of global emissions is critical to contribute to the goal of the 2015 Paris
