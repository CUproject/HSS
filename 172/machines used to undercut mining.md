## Block caving - QueensMineDesignWiki
Block caving is an underground mining method that uses gravity to exploit massive, steeply dipping ore bodies located at depth. These ore bodies are generally low grade in nature and are too deep to be extracted through open pit mining. The technique is commonly used to extract low grade copper, copper-gold, iron and molybdenum ores although

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Truck and shovel excavation systems are very common and efficient methods in surface mining. They are very adaptable to change in peak geometry in the advent of variations to geology or to sudden failures. They involve a relatively low capital cost and additional equipment can be obtained at short notice. In addition, they have higher resale value.

Underground Mining is generally used for areas where the mineral seam is too far underground for open cut mining to be of use. A tunnel, called a decline, is created to allow workers and machinery to reach the location of the minerals. Stope mining is used for most hard rock mining of minerals such as copper, silver, lead and zinc.
