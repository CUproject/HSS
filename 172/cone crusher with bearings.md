## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

## Cone Crusher - Ct950 - Conetech Engineering
CONETECH cone crushers are based on Roller Bearing System which makes them superior compared to cone crushers with bronze hydrostatic bearing. Since CONETECH cone crushers do not have upper bearings, its inlet is completely open, and this enables homogenous feeding into crushing chamber in coarse feeding applications.
