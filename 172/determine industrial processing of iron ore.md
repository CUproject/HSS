How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Extraction of Iron from its ores, Iron dressing, Reduction & production 
S + O 2 → SO 2. 4 P + 5 O 2 → 2 P 2 O 5. Roasting is the process of heating iron ore strongly in dry air for drying the ore and expelling humidity, It is used to increase the percentage of iron in the ore and for the oxidation of some impurities such as sulphur and phosphorus.. Roasting of iron is very important in the ore dressing process but this process pollutes the environment, Ore
