## Raw materials
Today, it is estimated that the global steel industry used about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore, 1 billion tonnes of metallurgical coal and 575 million tonnes of steel scrap to produce about 1.7 billion tonnes of crude steel. Recycled steel (also called scrap steel) is one of the industry's most important raw materials.

## Is steel/iron ore a Good Career Path? Best paying jobs in 2023
Sep 15, 2022Steel ore is a type of metal obtained from rocks and minerals. In the furnaces used by this industry, iron ore, scrap metal, and other additives are melted to produce steel. The half finished structures are then created from the molten metal before it is rolled, pulled, cast, and extruded into sheets, rods, bars, tubes, beams, and wire.

Introduction. Galvanizing is a process of coating iron or steel with zinc in order to provide greater protection against corrosion for the iron or steel base. The process of galvanizing sheet iron was developed simultaneously in France and England in 1837. Both of these methods employed a "hot dipping" process to coat sheet iron with zinc.
