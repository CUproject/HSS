Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material.

For each coal, the most economical plant design level is seen to depend on the desired degree of sulfur removal. For the cases in Figure 4, a Level 2 or 3 plant is preferred except at very high reduction levels where a Level 4 plant is superior.
