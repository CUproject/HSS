## Curing of concrete techniques - Holcim
For proper curing concrete needs moisture. Continuity in curing is a must; alterations of wetting and drying promote the development of cracking. If during curing the concrete is allowed to dry out - as may happen in hot weather - the chemical stops right at the point where the concrete loses its moisture. The ideal curing temperature is 23°C

## Precast Concrete in Winter Conditions | Nitterhouse Concrete
The American Concrete Institute states the ideal temperature range for pouring concrete is between 50 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 29 degrees Celsius). The ideal curing temperature is 72° F (22°C) over a 28-day curing period. That's nearly impossible for most of mid-Atlantic America in the fall, winter and spring.

## fast curing time for precast cement additives
The 28-Day Myth - National Precast Concrete Association Oct 28, 2013 · In precast concrete manufacturing, however, very early attainment of specified strengths - reaching the minimum required compressive strength much sooner than 28 days - is the norm.
