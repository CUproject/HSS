## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## A Beneficiation Study on a Low Grade Iron Ore by Gravity and Magnetic 
In this paper, a sample from Tange-zagh iron mine was characterized by gravity and magnetic separation methods. The mineralogical studies showed that hematite and goethite are the main iron-bearing minerals with insignificant amounts of FeO. The results indicated that spiral separation yields higher separation efficiency than others. The combination of spiral and multi gravity methods showed
