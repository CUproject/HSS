## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

## The Reason of Ball Mill's Uneven Discharging
Uneven ball mill's discharging may be caused by the following two aspects: Firstly, the feeding grinding materials cause the uneven discharging. When water into the grinding material is high, it may cause the ball mill grinding "full" phenomenon. If the water into the grinding material is too much, you can reduce the feed rate of ball mill
