Dec 3, 2020Only about a decade ago, such stark disparities in living conditions were not part of the landscape. It is all due to coal mining. In recent years, the impact of coal and other mining projects on India's Adivasi communities who inhabit much of the country's resource-rich tracts has drawn significant public attention.

## Environmental impact of coal industry and thermal power plants in India
India has about 90,000 MW installed capacity for electricity generation, of which more than 70% is produced by coal-based thermal power plants. Hydro-electricity contributes about 25%, and the remaining is mostly from nuclear power plants (NPPs). The problems associated with the use of coal are low calorific value and very high ash content.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Another ill effect of coal mining is its impact on the water resources which perhaps is the most important aspect as far as the existence of the villagers is concerned. Villagers in the affected villages claimed that coal-related waste and coal sludge are often injected in the nearby water bodies which makes the water unfit for domestic use.

## Coal Industry in India - Economics Discussion
In 1884, only 68.9% of the coal consumed on Indian railways was of domestic origin. This proportion gradually rose till, in 1903, 99.2% was obtained from Indian collieries. Imports of coal declined from 8.4 lakh tons in 1894 to 1.9 lakh tons in 1903; exports, first begun in 1886, increased to 4.4 lakh tons in 1903.
