## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.

## Iron Deposits - Banded Iron Formations (BIF) | Geology for Investors
All the world's Banded Iron Formations appear to have been formed by an unusual, one-off event. With many types of mineralisation - we can see the process occurring today - for example active volcanoes show us mines in the making, as does undersea hydrothermal activity. Banded iron formations (BIFs) are different - they were all formed at a time where the earth was a decidedly

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

##  Estimation of iron ore resources integrating diamond and percussion 
The technology of percussion drilling is well mastered. The lower cost of percussion drilling allows more holes to be drilled for the same budget . However significant differences are often observed between percussion and diamond drill assay data. This is due to the increased level of contamination associated with the percussion drilling process.
