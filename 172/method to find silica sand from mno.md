## Silica Sand Manufacturing Process | Silica Sand Extraction
At this time, the pickling method can be used. First, wash off the powder and impurities with water, and then use soak in acid, then rinse again with water, and finally dry or air dry. The above is the silica sand extraction process. Impurity removal is carried out when the impurity minerals and quartzes minerals reach the state of monomer
