## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers. Gyratory and cone crushers are likely to become jammed

How do you size a gyratory crusher? Primary gyratory crushers are designated by two numbers. These are the size of the feed opening (in inches) and the diameter of the mantle at its base (in inches). A 60″~x~89″ crusher would have an opening dimension of 60 inches (152 cm) and a diameter across the base of the mantle of 89 inches (226 cm).
