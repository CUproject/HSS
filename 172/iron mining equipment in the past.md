Iron manufacture in the Middle Ages was comprised of essentially three practices: mining, smelting and smithing. As will be argued in more detail below, these practices were basically identical to those used in colonial America. In effect, mining is the extraction of an ore or minerals, for example iron ore, from the earth, generally by means

Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
