## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

Transport. 1. Introduction. Iron (Fe) is an essential element for the growth of plants as well as other organisms. Fe is required for various cellular processes, such as respiration, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and photosynthesis, and serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in electron or oxygen transfer. Plants take up Fe from the soil.
