## mining industry will become an important area as the Silk Road Fund 
The senior executive said mining is a typical capital-intensive industry that needs large amounts of investment in each aspect of its cycle. From exploration, mining to production and processing, the Silk Road Fund can provide necessary financial support to mining companies helping them develop assets and make overseas acquisitions.

Grinding wheels vs cutoff wheels. Long story short, grinding wheels are thick and allow you to press down while grinding for removing material. Cutoff wheels are thin and are made for straight cuts with no lateral load. Cutting wheels typically 1/16â³ - 1/8â³ thick. Grinding wheels typically 1/8â³ - 1/4â³ thick.

## Grinding Wheels: Manufacture and Grade | Industries | Metallurgy
The grade of a wheel indicates the strength of the grains, and the holding power of the bond. It is usually referred to as hardness of the wheel. The thickness of the bonding layer holding abrasives controls the grade of the grinding wheel. A hard wheel wears down slowly and a soft wheel wears down readily.

The amount of abrasive bond in the grinding wheel determines its grade or hardness. Hardness is dependent on the grit type, the material being ground, the amount of stock removed, and a number of other factors. Hardness is rated from A-Z, with "A" being the weakest bond and "Z" being the strongest. Harder or stronger bonds in grinding
