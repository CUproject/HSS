Jan 25, 2022Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## Copper Processing | Multotec
Extraction of copper from ore begins with pre-treatment. Due to the decreasing concentration of copper in ores, this is an important step to decrease the volume of material and to increase the grade of copper in the ore. Most copper ores will only contain a small percentage of copper mineral, with the average grade being below 0.6% copper.

Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.
