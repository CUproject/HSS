Overview of Ball Mills. As shown in the adjacent image, a ball mill is a type grinding machine that uses balls to grind and remove material. It consists of a hollow compartment that rotates along a horizontal or vertical axis. It's called a "ball mill" because it's literally filled with balls. Materials are added to the ball mill, at

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.
