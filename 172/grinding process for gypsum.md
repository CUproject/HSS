## Grinding mill Plant For Gypsum Processing_Grinding Mill,Grinding 
The process used to mine gypsum is very similar to that used in many other rock quarries. First the exposed gypsum is fractured by drilling and blasting.  Sorted rock is then loaded for distribution to be further processed like for gypsum powder grinding by the end user. Gypsum processing contains gypsum crushing plant and gypsum grinding plant.
