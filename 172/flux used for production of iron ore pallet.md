## Direct production of molten iron from carbon composite iron ore pellet 
Molten iron was made directly by using the carbon composite iron ore pellets. These pellets were reduced rapidly in the high temperature atmosphere and formed a dense "metallic-shell" on its surface. This stage was followed by carburization which melted down the shell by lowering the melting point. The molten iron was clearly separated from slag.
