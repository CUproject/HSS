Molten iron was made directly by using the carbon composite iron ore pellets. These pellets were reduced rapidly in the high temperature atmosphere and formed a dense "metallic-shell" on its surface. This stage was followed by carburization which melted down the shell by lowering the melting point. The molten iron was clearly separated from slag.
