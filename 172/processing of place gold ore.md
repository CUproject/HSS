Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

##  An investigation of the carbonaceous component of preg-robbing gold ores
For many years carbonaceous gold ores have been identified as having the ability to adsorb gold (I) cyanide from leach solutions1-14. This phenomenon, known as preg-robbing, is responsible for poor recoveries as the carbonaceous component of the ore competes with activated carbon used during the leaching and adsorption phase of processing.

During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

## Gold Processing Plant | Multotec
The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process. The ore goes for preliminary screening, followed by stream sampling, which is a process that uses a hammer sampler.

To make the gold heap leaching process successful, the heap leaching material must have good permeability so that the cyanide solution can evenly pass through the ore pile. Most ores need to be crushed to 25.4mm or finer before granulation in order to expose the gold contained in the ore and improve the gold recovery rate.
