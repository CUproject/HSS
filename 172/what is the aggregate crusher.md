## Selecting the Right Crusher for Quarry Operations | Agg-Net
Sean Donaghy, national sales manager of IROCK Crushers discusses what needs to be considered when choosing a crusher. Crushing rock is an age-old idea, but the reality of the task is a far cry from that of Fred Flintstone and his good buddy Barney Rubble. Although crushing rock and other materials may seem simple, it is really a science.

## What is crushed aggregate base?
When doing structural foundations or base course under concrete slabs and asphalt pavement roadways, Aggregate Base is in use. It can be placed by attentive spreading then compacting. The sub-base if formed by dust and small chipped aggregate layers, typically Crushed Fines. The crushed aggregate base lays on heavy traffic or driveways areas.

## What are the Different Types of Aggregate Crushers?
Dec 14, 2021An aggregate crusher is a machine designed to grind or pulverize various types of rock into small, relatively uniform pieces. Aggregate crushers are used in mining, quarrying and recycling operations. Several types of crushers can perform this task including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crusher and cone crushers,. An aggregate crusher can be relatively small, like the mobile units
