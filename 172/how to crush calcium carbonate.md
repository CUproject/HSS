Calcium carbonate content. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) is the active ingredient when it comes to altering pH. This varies throughout the country from 99% to 65% CaCO 3, depending on local geology. A lower CaCO 3 lime will be needed in larger amounts to achieve the same effect. Lime with an 80% value will need to be applied at a 12.5% higher rate

Beginners guide to aquarium carbonate hardness KH. Apr 30, 2019 0183 32 Aragonite is the crystal form of calcium carbonate CaCO3 Just like with crushed coral, acids in the water cause aragonite to release calcium and carbonate However, unlike crushed coral, aragonite is made up of tiny sand-like grains Because of this, it is often used as a substrate sand in both freshwater and saltwater
