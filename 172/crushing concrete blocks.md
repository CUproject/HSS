The overall job of the concrete crusher is to break down the large blocks of aggregate and form smaller pieces that can be used in future construction jobs. There are several stages of crushing that the machine must go through. The first stage breaks down the larger blocks into smaller pieces. A 'jaw crusher' is utilized for this process.

## The Difference Between Cement, Cinder, and Concrete Blocks
People sometimes use the terms interchangeably, but concrete and cinder blocks are very different. Concrete. Concrete is an item made from cement and aggregates. The moment the ingredients are mixed together, a chemical reaction happens, and concrete is the end result. Aggregates. Concrete Blocks Concrete blocks are constructed from pure concrete.
