Methods/Analysis: Granite slurry waste does not contain silt or organic impurities. Also, the use of this waste in place of cement will reduce energy demand, CO2 emission and consumption of natural resources. Sufficient literature is available and it indicates that this waste can be used in place of Fine Aggregate (F.A.) or cement.
