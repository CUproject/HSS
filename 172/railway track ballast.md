A railroad track is mainly composed of rails, railroad ties (sleepers), fasteners, railway switch, ballast, subgrade. The components of railway track play different roles in providing support for trains. The track structure is built for rolling stock to roll upon safely and smoothly.

## Why There Is No Ballast on High Speed Rail Track? - Rail Joint
Ballast refers to the gravel or crushed rock paved on the road or railway subgrade, it is mainly used in railway subgrade. Ballast is one of the main components in the railway transportation system, used to support the railway sleeper and rail track. Before laying tracks, a layer of ballast is needed to pave on the railway subgrade.

Railroad track, like buildings, needs good drainage to remain in top condition for long periods.  While ballast provides track with firm support, it is not absolutely rigid. Each axle of a loaded, 100-ton car will deflect even the stiffest track about one-tenth of an inch, and relatively soft track will give as much as a half-inch.

I like to ballast this part of the track first because I can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time. First, I poured about 1 1 ⁄ 2 ounces of ballast into a 3-ounce drinking cup.

Railway ballast that has lost its geotechnical properties and is no longer able to fully support the rail track or provide adequate drainage has to be renewed. However, rather than sending the old ballast to landfill, much of this spent material can be turned into valuable recycled products by an effective washing and screening process.

The ballast will look better once the surrounding scenery is brought up to meet the ballast. Once all ballasting is completed test the track again as you will have small grains of ballast where they should not be and will have glue on your track. Small bits of ballast can be carefully removed with a scalpel blade, but take care.
