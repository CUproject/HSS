With 5 mines, 4 processing hubs and 2 port facilities, our Pilbara iron ore business is all connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure. At each mining hub ore from the mines is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create high-grade hematite lump and fines products.

## Origin of the Surigao iron ores | Economic Geology | GeoScienceWorld
The iron ore deposit of Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine islands, occurs as a surficial mantle over serpentinized ultrabasic rocks. The ore is lateritic in origin, having been derived by subaerial decomposition of the parent serpentine rock. The Surigao deposit resembles closely the lateritic iron ores of Mayari, Cuba.

## Philippines - Resources and power | Britannica
Although the Philippines is rich in mineral resources, mining activities constitute only a small portion of GDP and employ an even smaller fraction of the population. Most of the country's metallic minerals, including gold, iron ore, lead, zinc, chromite, and copper, are drawn from major deposits on the islands of Luzon and Mindanao. Smaller deposits of silver, nickel, mercury, molybdenum

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
