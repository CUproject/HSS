## Stone Aggregates Vs Crushed Brick Aggregates
Stone Aggregates Vs Crushed Brick Aggregates. Aggregates are split into two main categories fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Fine aggregates are generally made of sand or crushed stone and includes particles that can pass through a 3 8-inch sieve. Coarse aggregates include particles that range between 3 8 and 1.5 inches in diameter.Nov 11
