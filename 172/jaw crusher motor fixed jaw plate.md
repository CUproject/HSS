## The 5 Abrasion Reasons Of Jaw Plates In Jaw Crusher (I)
Dec 8, 2020In jaw crusher, the crushing cavity is formed by movable jaw plate and fixed jaw plate. As we know, raw materials are crushed in the crushing cavity, so jaw plates directly contact with the raw material and are easily damaged.  If there are impurities in the jaw plates of jaw crusher, it will cause the stress concentration. And the edges of

## Differences Between Fixed Jaw Crusher and Impact Rock Crusher
When it comes to the fixed jaw crusher, the motor drives the belt and the pulley, acting on the eccentric shaft to move the mobile jaw up and down. When the mobile jaw rises, the angle between the toggle and the mobile jaw becomes larger, hence pushing the mobile jaw plate close to the fixed jaw plate for the crushing purpose.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.
