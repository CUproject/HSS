Quartz Sand . Compound artificial stone selects inorganic binders (such as cement) and organic polymer material (colophony) as cementing agent. In production, first mould the mixture of scrap stones and rock flours with inorganic binders, then solidify the mixture, and at last, dip the mixture into organic monomer to make the compound artificial stone ensemble under certain circumstance.

Lay the artificial grass on top of the sand/soil (as opposed to dragging it onto the base material). Allow approximately 50mm of artificial grass to trim off to make that perfect edge ie in doorways or up a wall. Leave for around 1 to 2 days to settle.

## Artificial aggregate made from waste stone sludge and waste silt
Natural aggregates are obtained by mining sand and stone, which are then crushed, washed and sorted. Waste silt is produced at typical aggregate washing plants at between 5 and 80 ton per hour depending on plant size and materials being processed. In general, 10-15% of the raw sand and stone will become waste silt.
