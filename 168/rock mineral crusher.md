## Rock Crushers - Gold Fever Prospecting
A crusher is a machine often used by prospectors to test for gold and other valuable minerals and metals in rocks where gold is not easily visible on the surface. This gold once liberated from the host rock can be removed with something as simple as a gold pan or one of our other fine gold recovery tools. Rock and Ore Crushers listed below are

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
The double roll crusher is the most common rock stone crushing machine. Its crushing ratio is usually lower than in other crushers, so it's suitable for fine crushing. The roll crusher uses compression to crush materials, and the reduction ratio is 2 to 2.5 so roller crushers are not recommended for abrasive materials. Hammer Crusher
