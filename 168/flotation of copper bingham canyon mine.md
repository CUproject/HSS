Bingahm Canyon is a classic copper porphyry with a fairly uniform distribution of sulphide mineralisation, mainly chalcopyrite. The existing pit will be worked out by 2019 but Kennecott is evaluating the feasibility of deepening the pit to add an extra 2.83 million tonnes of copper resources and extend the mine's life from 2019 to 2036.
