## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance.However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

## What Is a Jaw Crusher? Here's How It Works - Cutting Technologies
Feb 18, 2021All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one. These two form a V-shaped chamber, where the materials are fed. The movable jaw will move back and forth against the fixed one, compressing all materials in the space between. The mobile jaw's movement will not be fixed from side-to-side. Instead, it moves in an elliptical motion with
