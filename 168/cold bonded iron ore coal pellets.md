## Cold bonded ore-coal composite pellets for sponge ironmaking Part 2 
Abstract Cold bonded ore-coal composite pellets developed on a laboratory scale (Part 1 of this two part paper) were tested in a rotary kiln sponge iron plant. This plant had a 12 m length refractory lined rotary kiln of 8 t/day iron ore throughput capacity. Kiln operation was optimised to achieve more than 90% metallisation of sponge iron using ore-coal composite pellets.
