The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Archean banded iron formations of India - ScienceDirect
The manganese and iron formations in stratigraphic associations from the Archean greenstone belts from India are therefore potential records for testing the hypothesis of early ocean oxygenation (e.g., Manikyamba and Naqvi, 1997) which in turn closely corresponds to the pre-GOE whiffs of oxygenation of the early atmosphere (Frei et al., 2009

The latter type contains large bodies of siderite and pyrite. Banded iron formations are ascribed genetically to large-scale hot-spring and fumarolic activity. Iron carbonate and sulfur components appear to be of subvolcanic, presumably magnatic, derivation, whereas silica was largely derived by chemical leaching of the volcanic rocks.
