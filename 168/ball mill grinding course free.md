## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

Ball Mill Design. A survey of Australian processing plants revealed a maximum ball mill diameter of 5.24 meters and length of 8.84 meters (Morrell, 1996). Autogenous mills range up to 12 meters in diameter. The length-to-diameter ratios in the previous table are for normal applications. For primary grinding, the ratio could vary between 1:1and

The grinding circuit operator must ensure that the ball mill runs properly loaded and gives the correct ore grind. A major practical indication of mill loading is the sound made by the mill. A properly loaded mill will have a deep rhythmic roar, while an under loaded mill will have a metallic rattling type noise and an overloaded mill will be quite silent.

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.
