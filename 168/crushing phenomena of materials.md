## Measuring Static and Dynamic Properties of Frozen Silty Soils
Maximum stresses achieved were slightly above 1 GPa, apparently limiting the observed behavior primarily to elastic compression and pore crushing phenomena. Lower temperatures seem to increase the strength of the material markedly, although not by a simple factor.

A study has been made of the micro mechanical origins of the irrecoverable compression of aggregates which comprise brittle grains. The terms "yielding" and "plastic hardening" are used in the discipline of soil mechanics to describe the post-elastic behaviour of granular media. These "plastic" phenomena are here related to the successive splitting of grains. Grains are taken to
