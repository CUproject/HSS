## Jaw Crusher - ScienceDirect
When used underground, jaw crushers are commonly used in open circuit. This is followed by further size reduction in crushers located on the surface. When the run of mine product is conveyed directly from the mine to the crusher, the feed to the primary crusher passes under a magnet to remove tramp steel collected during the mining operation.

Largest jaw crusher is 1600 x 2514 mm with motor ratings of kW. Metso crushers (C200 series) are 1600 x 2514 mm with motors rated at 400 kW.  Gyratory crushers are operated in open circuit. The feed is limited to 1 to 1.5 meters in size. Thus, based on reduction ratio, the rock size is reduced to 10 to 15 cm.
