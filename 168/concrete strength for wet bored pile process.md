Bored Piling Process . Installing a bored pile starts with drilling a vertical hole into the soil, using a bored piling machine. The machine can be outfitted with specially designed drilling tools, buckets, and grabs to remove the soil and rock. Piles can be drilled to a depth of up to 60 meters and a diameter of up to 2.4 meters.

## Concrete Strength for Bored cast in place piles and vibration 
Having a lower concrete strength may be ok for axially loaded piles however it would not be ideal for piles subject to lateral loads as concrete strength plays a big part in avoiding brittle failure of the pile. Lower strength would likely increase the the amount of rebar required. This may counteract your 10-20% saving.

## Pile Structural Capacity - Civil Engineering Knowledge Base
Circular boreholes are drilled in the ground before placing concrete into the borehole. The reinforcing steel can be set in the holes before the concrete is placed or "wet-set" before the concrete is allowed to set. Common bored-pile sizes range from 30 inches to 60 inches (750 mm to 1,500mm) in increments of 4 inches (100mm).

After concrete is placed, the concrete increases in strength very quickly for a period of 3-7 days. Concrete which is moist cured for 7 days is about 50% stronger than uncured concrete. Water curing can be done after the slab pour by building dams with soil around the house and flooding the slab. The enclosed area is continually flooded with water.

## Concrete Strength of Bored Cast In-situ Pile - Eng-Tips Forums
The recommended grade of concrete for our pile is M30 grade. We are using 400Kg/cum of cement but we are not achieving 30 N/mm2 on 28 days due to PPC cement. After 42 days some cubes have crossed 30N/mm2 whereas other cubes didn't. The piles load carrying capacity are calculated based on soil profile and we don't consider concrete strength in

## Bored Cast in Situ Concrete Pile, Its Construction and Applications
Bored cast in situ pile Concreting. According to IS 2911, slump of concrete employed for pile concreting ranges from 150mm to`80mm. Prevent interruption of concreting from the start of the process till the end of the work. Concreting begins by lowering tremie pipes in to the borehole. Common tremie pipe diameter is around 200mm.
