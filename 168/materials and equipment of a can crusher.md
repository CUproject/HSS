Most crushers used for aggregate production can be categorised as one of three main types: Compression crushers - which squeeze the material until it breaks. Impact crushers - which use the principle of rapid impact to shatter material. A ttrition crushers - which use both impact and grinding to shear material.

An impact crusher uses mass and velocity to break down feed material. First, the feed material is reduced as it enters the crusher and makes contact with the rotating blow bars or hammers in the rotor. Secondary breakage then occurs as the material is accelerated into the stationary aprons or breaker plates.
