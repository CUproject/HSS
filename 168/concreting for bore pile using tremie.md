## What is the Difference Between CFA Piles and Bored Piles  - Piletech
There are two main types of concrete piles; the end bearing piles, where the pile serves as a column holding the load down to the bearing strata, and the friction piles, where the load is progressively moved along the length of the pile. Bored piles are often large in diameter in comparison to traditional continuous flight auger (CFA) piles.

The Tremie pipe will be inserted at the center of the pile to reach up to the toe. The Tremie will be lifted 100mm above pile toe level prior to concreting. While concreting the length of the Tremie pipe will be shortened if necessary, however, the Tremie pipe will be maintained full time into the concrete of at least 2.0m length.

Bored cast in situ pile Concreting. According to IS 2911, slump of concrete employed for pile concreting ranges from 150mm to`80mm. Prevent interruption of concreting from the start of the process till the end of the work. Concreting begins by lowering tremie pipes in to the borehole. Common tremie pipe diameter is around 200mm.
