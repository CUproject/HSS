## A comparative study on the effects of dry and wet grinding on mineral 
Several investigations indicated that variations of the surface energy of solids and the degree of dispersion are the main factor when dry and wet grinding systems are compared,, .It was documented that in a wet grinding system by increasing the percentage of solids, part of the energy is converting to the surface energy, and dry ground samples have higher surface energy than wet ground ones .
