The machining process of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece by advancing or feeding in a direction at an angle with the axis of the tool. Milling processes are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece. Milling machines are the principal machine tool used in milling.

## What is Face Milling? 10 Tips You Should Know abount Face Milling
What is face milling? Face milling is a machining process in which the milling cutting is placed perpendicular to the workpiece. The milling cutting is essentially positioned "face down" towards the top of the workpiece. When engaged, the top of the milling cutting grinds away at the top of the workpiece to remove some of its material.

## Sugar processing: growing, milling, refining
Refining sugar. The 'raw' sugar from the mill arrives at the refinery where it is mixed with hot syrup to soften the hard molasses coating on the outside of the sugar.
