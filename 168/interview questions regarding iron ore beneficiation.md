Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

##  Iron Ore Tailings: Characterization and Applications - IBRAM
1.1. The iron ore beneficiation process There are different types of iron beneficiation processes. The choice of the process depends on the mineral composition, iron content, and degree of liberation of iron from gangue minerals.11 The most common beneficiation processes are magnetic separation, flotation, reverse

## interview questions regarding iron ore beneficiation
Beneficiation of -2 mm low-grade iron ore tailings 507 Fe 108 SiO2 and 44 Al2O3 from Western Australia was studied The sample consisted of hydrohematite goethite and quartz with lesser kaolinite and shale Two processing options were tested being wet high-intensity magnetic separation WHIMS either using deslimed or untreated feed
