## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The Miller process is rapid and simple, but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis. In this process, a casting of impure gold is lowered into an electrolyte solution of hydrochloric acid and gold chloride.

Before gold is mined, we first carryout a significant exploration and development to determine the size of the gold deposit in a particular gold mine. The process or lifecycle of gold mine starts with exploration (1-10 years), development (this takes about 1 to 5 years), operation (10-30 years), decommissioning (1-5 years) and the post closure.

Mining Process. The easiest way to mine for gold was called "panning", a miner would scope up some of the sand from the river bend and swirl it around; gold being one of the heaviest materials would sink to the bottom. Once the gold sunk to the bottom it was easy for the miner to identify it as gold and they would pull it out of the mixture

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
