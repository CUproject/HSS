The screening process starts by removing larger stones, then medium stones, and eventually goes all the way down to the stone dust.  Crushed stone often has an angular and jagged edge that occurs during the crushing process. Gravel, on the other hand, typically has a very smooth texture and surface because of the natural weathering and wear

Crushing 1. Presented by: Muhammad Ali Mohsin (MME-16-04) 2. Crushing: Crushing is the first mechanical stage in communation process for extraction and refining of ore. It is generally a dry operation and is usually performed in two or three stages.i.e primary,secondary and tertiary stage. In Primary crushing the feed size of ore can be as large as 1.5m and is reduced to 10-20cm in heavy duty

## DTI: Dust Control at Concrete Crushing Facilities | BossTek
The transportation process of demolition materials in nearly all industries creates pesky dust. At concrete crushing facilities, dust is generated at multiple points. Front end loaders, hoppers, and conveyor discharge points all bring dust when operational. Front end loaders transfer the incoming demolition materials to the hopper.

## RUC1 - Device for automatic control of material crushing process 
A device for automatically controlling the crushing process, which uses as control actions a change in the speed of the drive motor of the crusher and the productivity of the feeder [I]. The device includes two circuits: main and auxiliary. The main circuit is used to control the rotation speed of the crusher engine and includes a crusher

## AMIT 135: Lesson 5 Crushing - Mining Mill Operator Training
The purpose of the primary crusher is to reduce the ROM ore to a size amenable for feeding the secondary crusher or the SAG mill grinding circuit. The ratio of reduction through a primary crusher can be up to about 8:1. Feed: ROM up to 1.5 m. Product: -300mm (for transport) to -200mm (for SAG mill) Feed Rate:
