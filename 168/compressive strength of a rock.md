Jun 8, 2022Compressive strength is a limited state of compressive stress that leads to failure in a material in the manner of ductile failure (infinite theoretical yield) or brittle failure (rupture as the result of crack propagation, or sliding along a weak plane).

## The uniaxial compressive strength of soft rock.
Soft rock is a term that usually refers to a rock material with a uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) less than 20 MPa. This low strength range might be influenced by physical characteristics, such as size, saturation, weathering and mineral content. A number of uniaxial compression tests have been conducted onto soft rock samples.

## Bearing Capacity of Rocks | Civil Engineering X
The bearing capacity of a homogeneous, and discontinuous rock mass cannot be less than the unconfined compressive strength of the rock mass around the footing and this can be taken as a lower bound for a rock mass with constant angle of internal friction 0 and unconfined compressive strength qur. Goodman (1980) suggests the following equation

The "unconfined" compressive strength is equal to 2 times the undrained shear strength. For all intents and purposes the ultimate bearing capacity is 6 times the undrained shear strength (where c in cNc is the undrained shear strength) or 3 times the unconfined compressive strength.

## The Strongest Rock in the World - Rockhound Resource
The strongest rock in the world is diabase, followed closely by other fine-grained igneous rocks and quartzite. Diabase is strongest in compression, tension, and shear stress. If mineral hardness is the determining factor of strength then diamond is technically the strongest rock in the world. Rock strength is not always an easy thing to measure.
