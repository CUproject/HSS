## The Machines Used in Hydroelectric Power Stations
As they can produce the most electricity, impulse turbines are widely used in hydroelectric power stations. Reaction turbines, on the other hand, are low to medium head turbines. There are two main types: Francis and Kaplan turbines. The Francis turbine has two rings of guiding blades. The outside ring is stationary, whereas the inside ring

## Machine Guarding - SafetySkills
Manufacturers design their machines to protect operators from coming into contact with hazardous parts. Despite this, machines cause more than 18,000 injuries—including amputations, lacerations, and crushing injuries—in the United States each year. Many of these injuries were caused by unsafe operation or improper maintenance. Machine guards, or barriers between the operator and dangerous
