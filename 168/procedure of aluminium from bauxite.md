## Procedure To Extract Aluminium From Bauxite
The History Of The Aluminium Extrual Extrual. 1889- Karl Josef Bayer finds a procedure to extract alumina from bauxite. As a result, aluminium prices start decreasing drastically and the first applications appear. 1960- Aluminium was recycled for the first time, because the recycling cost is 95% lower than its extraction from bauxite.

Aluminum manufacturing begins with bauxite, an ore that consists of aluminum oxide, iron, and other metals. As soon as the bauxite is mined, it's subjected to the Bayer process—a method named in honor of the Austrian chemist who developed it in the late nineteenth century. Since aluminum oxide must be separated from any surrounding

Firstly, aluminium has to be removed from the Earth, by mining. This is relatively simple, given the abundance of Aluminium. However, Aluminium is always bounded to other elements, and exists as compounds, often containing oxygen and silicon. Thus, it is impossible to obtain a pure substance of aluminium through mining. Aluminium's ore is bauxite.

## Process of Making Aluminium
Leveraging cutting edge technology, aluminium making process is continually refined to maintain high standards of quality and efficiency, and production expertise has been honed into a fine craft over the years.  1 BAUXITE MINING. The first step of aluminium production begins with the mining of bauxite, a clay like soil typically found in

## Aluminium - Rio Tinto
Aluminium is made from bauxite, or aluminium ore. Bauxite is the basic raw material that is refined into alumina, which in turn is sent to smelters for processing into aluminium.  In 1886, Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult independently developed a process for making aluminium from alumina. And in 1887, Austrian scientist Karl Josef
