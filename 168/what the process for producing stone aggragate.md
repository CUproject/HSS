## How to Expose Aggregate in Concrete
There are several exposure methods contractors can choose from, depending on the look desired and size of the project. Only the top of the stone is exposed while the rest remains permanently embedded in the concrete. The general rule of thumb is to remove the surface mortar to a depth no more than one-third the diameter of the aggregate particle.

Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing

Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel, crushed stone, sand, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

In grading of aggregates, the voids in the mixed aggregate would be minimum when the sand is just sufficient to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate. Voids in the coarse aggregate are filled in by sand and voids in the sand are filled in by cement. Mix that occupies the least volume is the densest and will produce the best results.
