The miners were willing to take the risks in order to provide for their families. The miners would cart the ore out of the mine in wheeled carts pushed on rails and take it to the mill. The gold milling process consisted of three general steps: (1) Sorting the ore by size. (2) Crushing the rock. (3) Extracting the gold.

Rockbursts present hazards that are particular to hard rock mines. Factors that affect seismicity at a mine include rock characteristics, pre-mining stresses, the presence of geological structures, the amount of material extracted and mine sequencing. Figure 2.3 shows damage mechanisms caused by rockbursts.
