What is open pit mining. On the other hand, open-pit mining also be called surface mining, is the most common mining and ranges from very low-priced minerals to finely disseminated gold deposits. When minerals and deposits are found close to the surface and spread across a large distance, the best way to mine is to use the open cut mining method.
