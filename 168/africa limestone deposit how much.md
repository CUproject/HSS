Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater, the primary agents being lime-secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones, forming clastic deposits. Travertine, tufa, caliche, chalk, sparite, and micrite are all varieties of limestone.
