## cement - History of cement | Britannica
History of cement. The origin of hydraulic cements goes back to ancient Greece and Rome.The materials used were lime and a volcanic ash that slowly reacted with it in the presence of water to form a hard mass. This formed the cementing material of the Roman mortars and concretes of more than 2,000 years ago and of subsequent construction work in western Europe.

## Embodied carbon of concrete in buildings, Part 1: analysis of published EPD
1.2 Embodied carbon of buildings. The environmental impacts of buildings are commonly divided into two types: embodied and operational (Ibn-Mohammed et al. 2013).These can be further defined through reference to European Standards EN 15978 and EN 15804 in 2012 (CEN 2011, 2019), which produced clear descriptions of the life-cycle stage impacts of a construction product, building or project

## Slag cement with fly ash
Slag cement replaces as much as 50 percent in normal concrete (and up to 80 percent in special applications such as mass concrete). Fly ash is usually limited to 20 or 30 percent. Slag cement is the co-product of a controlled process, iron production, which results in a very uniform composition from source to source.
