## Coal briquetting technology - process, binder and the briquette machine
The principle of binder free coal briquetting is to briquette coal with a suitable size. Under the extremely high pressure of the briquetting machine, all air is squeezed out, the coal particles are fully integrated then. The cohesive properties of the particles are firmly bonded to the coal powder, which makes the coal briquettes.
