The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

Greater is the aggregate crushing value, softer is the aggregate sample and vice versa. This is suggestive of the fact that the resistance of aggregates to crushing is less. Therefore, the strength of such a sample is also less. Aggregates having relatively less ACV can be used in wearing surfaces of pavements. 2)Hardness

## strength variation of recycled fine aggregate with crushing and with 
Recycling concrete pavements. The type of crushing equipment used influences fine aggregate gra-dation. Usually the fine material will be very angular, with an extre m e - ly high absorption rate and a low specific gravity, because the majority of the fine material is mortar from the old concrete. in recycled fine ag-g regate the chloride content is about 0.03%o.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregates - Properties and Uses of Recycled 
This influenced by strength of crushed concrete, water to cement ratio of crushed and new concrete. For concrete produced from both recycled coarse and fine aggregate is between 15 to 40%. 2. Strength Variations Strength variation of concrete produced from recycled aggregate is higher than concrete made from natural aggregate.
