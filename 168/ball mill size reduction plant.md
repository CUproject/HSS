A ball mill works on the principle of impact: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. Construction: A Ball Mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.It is partially filled with balls.

## Ball Mill Design/Power Calculation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations), rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground, characteristics, Bond Work Index, bulk density, specific density, desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH, operating % solids or pulp density, feed size as F80 and maximum 'chunk size', product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open/closed
