Modifying a concrete mix design to replace higher carbon materials with lower carbon ingredients is an effective strategy to reduce its environmental footprint. Whereas the U.S. standard for portland cement allows for up to 5% of clinker to be replaced by limestone, the standard for blended cement allows for 5% to 15% limestone replacement in

## A Review of The Dolomite and Limestone Industry in South Africa
In the South African limestone and dolomite industry, there are currently 24 producers and 43 quarries. Eleven limestone producers supply 80% of the South African market. Dolomite and limestone are used commercially in unprocessed, ground, air-separated, precipitated and calcined forms. Cementitious products are derived from a blend of limestone,
