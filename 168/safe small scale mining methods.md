Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) is mineral extraction by individuals, cooperatives, or small companies with minimal capital investment and with much use of manual labour. ASM is an important rural and peri-urban livelihood. ASM is also a dangerous workplace and for many a poverty trap where health risks are many and human rights are few.

## Artisanal mining
An artisanal miner or small-scale miner (ASM) is a subsistence miner who is not officially employed by a mining company, but works independently, mining minerals using their own resources, usually by hand.. Small-scale mining includes enterprises or individuals that employ workers for mining, but generally still using manually-intensive methods, working with hand tools.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
