## Exploitation of iron ore tailing for the development of ceramic tiles
Conclusions. From the present study, the following conclusions are drawn. 1. Tailings generated by the iron ore industry may be used as one of the raw materials for ceramic floor and wall tiles to the extent of a maximum 40 wt.%. Its high silica content favours formulation of tile body compositions. 2.

## Exploitation of iron ore tailing for the development of ceramic tiles
The current practice of washing iron ore in India generates as high as 18 million tonnes of tailings per year. These tailings are stored in massive ponds and pose environmental hazards. Safe disposal or utilisation of these materials thus remains a challenging task for the iron ore industry in India.
