## chemicals manufacturer used in during flotation of iron ore
Iron - Essential Chemical Industry. Much of the ore is mined in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia and the US. Most ores contain more than 60% iron and are used in their mineral state in a blast furnace. Ore containing less than this is first crushed and ground into a powder and concentrated by flotation.

## chemicals used in iron mining
The first iron mining techniques used charcoal which was mixed with iron ore in a bloomery. When heating the mixture and blowing air (oxygen) in through bellows, the iron ore is converted to the metal, iron. The chemical reaction between iron oxide and carbon is used here to produce iron metal. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.
