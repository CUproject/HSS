## Gold Price Chart
The gold/silver ratio is simply the amount of silver required to buy a single ounce of gold. For example, if gold is at $1200 per ounce and silver is at $15 per ounce, the ratio would be calculated as $1200/$15 = 80. This means it would take 80 ounces of silver to buy a single ounce of gold. Charts of this ratio may potentially be useful, as

Since establishing formal guidelines in 2013, the World Gold Council's (WGC) All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC) has been an important metric for comparing costs per payable metal unit sold for gold mining companies. However, it should not be a surprise that there are many interpretations of AISC, even with explicit WGC guidelines.
