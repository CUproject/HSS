## Lime Production Process and Required Equipment | Fote Machinery
Oct 28, 2021The reaction formula from limestone to lime is: CaC0 3 =Ca0+CO 2 ↑. There are two types of lime: one is quick lime and the other is slaked lime（also called hydrated lime. Quick lime is made by calcinating the limestone in the rotary kiln, and it is white power which often used as building material. The slaked lime produced by the reaction

## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
Unlike limestone, it has a looser, earthy structure; therefore, it refers to specifically designed raw materials for wet production. Chalk is soft raw material, it does not require crushing. Marl is a limestone with admixtures of silex and clay substances, as well as iron oxide.It is a transitional stage to clay.

## What Is Manufacturing Process Of Limestone In India
The Cement Manufacturing Process CMA India. The cement manufacturing process starts with the mining of limestone that is excavated from open cast mines. Then this limestone is crushed to -80 mm size and is loaded in longitudinal stockpiles. Limestone is taken out diagonally from these stockpiles for grinding in raw mill hoppers.
