## What are magnetic materials and non magnetic materials?
Jun 12, 2022What is the difference between magnetic and non magnetic materials. Substances that are attracted to a magnet are perhaps called magnetic substances. Example: iron, cobalt, nickel, etc. Substances that are not normally attracted to a magnet are called non-magnetic materials. Aluminum, for example: copper, material, etc.

## Is Stainless Steel Magnetic or Non-magnetic in external field
The straight answer is: some material grades of stainless steel are attracted by the magnetic field and so are called magnetic while others are not and called as nonmagnetic stainless steel. Some of the examples of magnetic stainless steel are: 440C Martensitic Stainless Steels in ASTM F899 Standard. UNS S42000 Stainless Steel Martensitic Grades.

Magnetic materials are materials that a magnet will attract to itself when placed near a magnet (or when placed in its field). For example- iron, cobalt and nickel. 1. Non-magnetic materials that will not experience any magnetic force when placed near a magnet, in other words, it will not be attracted to the magnet.

## Magnetic Whiteboard vs Non-Magnetic - Which is Better?
Magnetic whiteboards are popular, especially in schools, but in some situations a non-magnetic marker board might be sufficient for your needs — and be a lower-cost solution than a magnetic whiteboard. Whiteboards are manufactured with a variety of materials used for the dry erase surface. The resulting products are melamine, porcelain, glass

## Difference Between Paramagnetic, Diamagnetic, And Ferromagnetic 
Mar 14, 2022Diamagnetic are those materials in which the resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When the magnetic field is applied, those electrons which have the orbital magnetic moment in the same direction slow down, and those in the opposite direction speed up. This happens due to the induced current in accordance with the Lenz law.

## What is difference between magnetic and nonmagnetic materials?
The materials which are not attracted towards a magnet are non-magnetic materials. Examples of non-magnetic materials include rubber, coins, feather and leather. What is meant by magnetic property of materials? A magnetic material is a material which under the influence of its magnetic field can attract or repel other substances.

## What is the different between magnetic and non-magnetic?
The key difference between magnetic and non-magnetic materials is that the magnetic materials are attracted to an external magnetic field due to their proper alignment of magnetic domains whereas non-magnetic materials are repelled from an external magnetic field due to their random arrangement of magnetic domains.
