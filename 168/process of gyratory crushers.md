Mar 5, 2021The gyratory crusher is a large crusher which makes use of the gyratory movement of the crushing cone in the inner cone cavity to extrude, split and bend the material for various kinds of rocks and stones. Gyratory crusher is a typical coarse crushing equipment in a large mineral dressing plant. Both gyratory crusher and jaw crusher can be used as coarse crushing machinery.

## Clearing Blocked Crushers - Health and Safety Authority
Raw material of various sizes are brought to the primary crusher by rear-dump haul units, or carried by a wheel front-end loader. Primary crushing reduces excavated rock to a more manageable size. There are different types of primary secondary and tertiary crushers including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crushers, and autogenous crushers.
