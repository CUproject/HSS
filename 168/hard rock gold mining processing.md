## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.

Jan 28, 2021Hard rock mining is a process that includes various techniques of excavating minerals from hard rock - especially those that contain metals such as silver, gold, iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel. This process also involves the same techniques while excavating large ore bodies containing gems such as rubies and diamonds.

## Gold Mining Methods
Summary. Historically, the majority of gold was mined from "placer deposits", where gold has settled out of an existing or ancient waterway downstream of where nuggets had eroded out of rock outcrops.Some early miners also used an early form of hardrock mining, digging solid veins of gold out of rock, where mineralized water had deposited it over thousands of years.
