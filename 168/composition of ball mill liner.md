## Ball Mill Liners Material Selection And Application
Force analysis. The main function of the ball mill liner is to protect the mill and use the convex peak of the liner to play the ball to grind and crush the material. Therefore, the main failure mode of the liner is abrasive wear under the repeated impact of small energy. Fig. 1 shows the motion diagram of grinding ball and material.
