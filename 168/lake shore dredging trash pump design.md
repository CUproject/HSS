## Importance of Pond & Lake Maintenance - Midwest Dredging
It is a routine necessity in waterways around the world because sedimentationâ€”the natural process of sand and silt washing downstreamâ€”gradually fills ponds, lakes, and waterways. Dredging often is focused on maintaining or increasing the depth of any body of water. Dredging is also performed to reduce the exposure of fish, wildlife, and

## Lake Dredging 101: Everything You Need to Know - Marine Matcher
Water naturally carries and deposits sediment in lakes. Over time, this can cause some areas of the lake to become too shallow for boats and ships to navigate. With lake dredging, we can remove added sediment and maintain the necessary depths for recreational and commercial traffic. Lakes that become too shallow also put the environment at risk.

## Lake and Pond Dredging - Slurry Pumping and Dredge Consulting
First and foremost, dredging can help by increasing water volume and depth to even more than 15ft, which will boost the flow. By removing the deposits, the entire life span of the lake can be reset. Secondly, it can also remove deep-rooted plants and debris. The appearance of the surrounding area (docks, beaches) can be remarkably improved too.

## How To Dredge A Pond | A Definitive Guide With DIY Methods
Using a Dredge Pump. If you find that the depositions in your pond are mostly semi-solid, then using a dredge pump will be effective to remove them. You can also use a trash pump. Renting one of these won't be hard. Dredge pumps are centrifugal pumps that can suck semi-solid materials. Before using the pump, relocate the fish to a stock tank.
