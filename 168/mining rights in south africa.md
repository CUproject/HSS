## Mining industry of South Africa
Diamond and gold production are now well down from their peaks, though South Africa is still number 5 in gold [3] but remains a cornucopia of mineral riches. It is the world's largest producer [4] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite. It is the second largest producer [4] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium.

## Communities, mining corporations and corruption in South Africa
Practices like this have undermined laws that were passed after 1994 to control the negative effects of mining. For example, the National Environmental Management Act stipulates that development shouldn't be allowed if it will lead to irreversible environmental degradation. And the South African Constitution makes provision for two rights potentially affected by mining.

## Mining and minerals in South Africa - Brand South Africa
The junior mining sector in South Africa was born of new legislation in the form of the Mining and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 2006. The law enforced a "use it or lose it" principle, stipulating that mining rights not used by mining companies to exploit minerals in the ground would revert back to the state.
