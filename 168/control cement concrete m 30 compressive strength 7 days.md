Compressive strength of concrete: Out of many test applied to the concrete, this is the utmost important which gives an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not. For cube test two types of specimens either cubes of 15 cm X 15 cm X 15 cm or 10cm X 10 cm x 10 cm depending upon the size of aggregate are used.

Compressive Strength of Concrete at 7 days and 28 days. Concrete continues to hydrate and to gain strength for years after it is poured. Concrete gains strength due to the chemistry of the hydration of the cement. Essentially the cement continues to hydrate while there is moisture available which it can simply take from the air in most cases.

## 7 day concrete strength - Structural engineering general discussion 
Here is a typical formula for calculating strength based on time for "normal" concrete. You have to know the design or expected f'c. t is time in days since the concrete was cast. f'ci= f'c (t/ (4.00+0.85t)) If you don't know the f'c, back into it using the 7-day break value. Then use that f'c value to calculate your 28-day strength.

The lower the w/c ratio, generally, the higher the durability of the concrete for most applications. For 3000 psi concrete, the w/c ratio can be as high as about 0.60. For 4000 psi concrete, the w/c ratio can be in the range of 0.50 to 0.52, depending on other aspects of the mix design. Review ACI and PCA requirements for mix designs.

What is standard concrete strength? Concrete footings and slabs on grade typically require a concrete of 3,500 to 4,000 psi. Suspended slabs, beams, and girders (as often found in bridges) require 3,500 to 5,000 psi. Traditional concrete walls and columns tend to range from 3,000 to 5,000 psi, while 4,000 to 5,000 psi is needed for pavement.
