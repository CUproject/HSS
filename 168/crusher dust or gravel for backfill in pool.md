To calculate how much gravel you need to cover a rectangular area you need to multiply the volume by the gravel density. The volume formula for a rectangular (or square) box in cubic feet is height (ft) x width (ft) x length (ft), as seen in the figure below: For example, to fill a box with a width of 3ft and a length of 6ft, to a depth of 1ft

Second, a retaining wall must have properly compacted backfill. Backfill refers to the dirt behind the wall. In order to provide proper drainage, at least 12 inches of granular backfill (gravel or a similar aggregate) should be installed directly behind the wall. Compacted native soil can be used to backfill the rest of the space behind the wall.

4. In clay soil, the water just sits in the hole, especially where the water table is close to the surface. Gravel lets the water get right up against the post, which will rot it out fast. Using concrete will help the post to last longer, if you create a dome of concrete above soil level and make sure it is smooth and tight against the post.

Probably self compacting. #57, which is 1/2 to 3/4-inch gravel is generally considered to be self compacting. This is because there are no fines to inerfer with the movement, so it goes to where there is direct contact between the particles. Short of braking the rocks, which would require a great deal of force, the material won't get any tighter.

When excavating for a fiberglass pool, the over-dig is typically about 12 inches. Therefore, the deep end of the pool will be backfilled with either 6 feet of sand or 6 feet of gravel to fill in the over-dig.
