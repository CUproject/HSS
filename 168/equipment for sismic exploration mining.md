## Gemstone Exploration Techniques - Ganoksin Jewelry Making Community
Today, almost all of the world's gemstone mining is done on a low-tech, artisanal level - miners digging by hand or with light equipment, seeking pay dirt. In most places, exploration is a hit-and-miss process, with deposits typically being small and widely dispersed. Miners dig, and either they get lucky or they don't.
