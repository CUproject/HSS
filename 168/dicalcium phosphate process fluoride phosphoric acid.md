Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO 4 and its dihydrate. The "di" prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO 4 2- anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4.It is also known as dibasic calcium phosphate or calcium monohydrogen phosphate.Dicalcium phosphate is used as a food additive, it is found in some
