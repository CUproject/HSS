## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
The mining regulations do not stipulate definite bench heights in hard rocks except that the bench width has to be more than the bench height. In manual quarry the bench height is usually 3 metres to 4.5 metres and in mechanised quarries, more than 5.5 metres and depends upon the height of the boom of shovel above the bench floor.
