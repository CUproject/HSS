## Can white cement be used for concrete?hcharge
Is white cement strong enough? White cement can be useful in filling gaps and cracks if used properly. White cement tends to shrink after drying so a proper mix of cement with sand and water will be helpful for filling the gaps. There are many variants of white cement by different cement companies available in the market.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process - Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

Is white cement strong? Production of white concrete with a compressive strength between 25 and 50 Mpa is possible by using white cement. It was also found out in study that white concrete had higher compressive strength than normal gray concrete. The strength in opc cement comes from calcium aluminate present in it.

The manufacturing process of white cement is somewhat different from manufacturing process of gray cement. During manufacturing if metal oxides i.e. iron and manganese are added, they help in increasing the whiteness of cement. Because of change in manufacturing process and cost of raw materials, white cement is costlier than gray cement.
