5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc.. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium

## Ball Mill Load Calculation
Grinding Control Strategy On The Conventional Milling A calculation using the particle sizes from cyclone flow, which is the fresh feed to the second ball mill. if circulating load in the second ball mill is kept constant, any variation in the fresh feed will ultimately be reflected in the product particle size of cyclone 2. water addition to.

## Ball Load Calculation In Ball Mills
Calculation Of A Ball Mill Load Muster Meier. In practice, circulating loads between ball mills and classifiers are rarely less than 200 per cent and frequently exceed 700 per cent.It may appear strange at first sight that the circulating load between a mill and classifier producing, for example, 100 tons of finished product per day can be as much as 400 tons or more, but this will be made
