The difference between static and dynamic analysis is simple. As I wrote at the beginning, static analysis means, that the load "is just there" and does not change in time (which means it was applied really slowly!). Dynamic analysis is precisely on the opposing side of the scale. Here, we wonder how the load is applied and how fast it

The opposite of dynamic typing is static typing. Static type checks are performed without running the program. In most statically typed languages, for instance C and Java, this is done as your program is compiled. The type of a variable is not allowed to change over its lifetime.

The basic job of a separator is to separate on-spec material from oversize. You do not want this oversize material entering the product stream; it needs to be recirculated through the grinding process. But you also do not want to recirculate on-spec material. That wastes energy and raises costs. Getting this balance is key to separator efficiency.

They are static binding and dynamic binding. The key difference between static binding and dynamic binding is that, in static binding, the binding is resolved at the compile time while dynamic binding is resolved at the run time, which is the actual time of execution. This article discusses the difference between these two binding mechanisms.

## Difference Between Static and Dynamic Equilibrium
Additionally, if the system is stationary, it is in static equilibrium, and if moving at a constant velocity, it is in dynamic equilibrium. • In a thermodynamic system, if the temperature is constant and the heat and mass transfer input and output are at equal rates, the system is in (dynamic/ thermodynamic) equilibrium.

Difference Between Static And Dynamic Separator. An efficient separator prevents overgrinding and as consequence a waste of energythere are mainly two types of separators static separators and dynamic separators the biggest difference is that static separators dont have moving parts and can be adjusted only with mechanical modifiionsstatic
