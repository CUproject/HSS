## Aggregate Production Planning, Materials Requirement Planning, Scheduling
Aggregate production plans facilitate matching of supply and demand while reducing costs. Process of Aggregate production planning applies the upper-level predictions to lower-level, production-floor scheduling and is most successful when applied to periods 2 to 18 months in the future. Plans generally either "chase" demand, adjusting
