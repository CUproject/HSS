In a 2,000m mine the load at the bottom of the lift will be very different from the load at the top, simply because of the weight of the rope: 2,000m of rope weighs several tons. The challenge for a 2,000m shaft is completely different from a shallow shaft, because of that weight. You can see why rope weight becomes so important.
