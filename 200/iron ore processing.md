## Iron Ore Processing Methods - فرابین
Iron ore processing is one of the most important procedures in the industry. The extracted iron must be beneficiated in order to be used in steel making. The product of iron processing is iron concentrate or granulated iron ore. In general, there are 5 stages in processing of iron including crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation and

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.

## For iron ore pellets?ntal
What are steel pellets used for? Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing.The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the United States.

## Iron ore | BHP
With 5 mines, 4 processing hubs and 2 port facilities, our Pilbara iron ore business is all connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure. At each mining hub ore from the mines is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create high-grade hematite lump and fines products.
