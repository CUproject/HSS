##  Research Paper USE OF STONE DUST FROM CONSTRUCTION SITE AS A  - IJSCER
The stone dust from the crusher units of construction sites is an environmental hazard. The disposal of stone dust is a major problem. In this paper an attempt is made to study the effective use of stone dust as a stabilizing agent. An experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of stone dust on engineering properties of soil.
