## Silica Sand | Its Properties and 7 Uses of Silica Sand - Civil Click
Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.

The content of quartz sand in China is higher than that of silica sand, which is the main raw material for making glass. Silica sand includes ordinary silica sand, refined silica sand and high-purity silica sand. The content of silica in ordinary silica sand is between 90% and 99%, and the content of iron oxide is less than 0.02%.

Silica creates a protective measure against animals, bacteria, and fungi in a couple of ways. One is that the composition of the plant itself becomes less palatable. A second is that the molecular structure is such that it becomes less digestible. A third protective measure is the ability to entice its predators.
