Copper deposits occur in sedimentary and volcanogenic rocks within a wide variety of geologic environments where there may be little or no evidence of hydrothermal alteration. Some deposits may be hypogene and have a deep-seated source for the ore fluids, but because of rapid cooling and dilution during syngenetic deposition on the ocean floor, the resulting deposits are not associated with

## Copper production in India
Copper production in India is only about 2 percent of world copper production in view of its potential reserve limited to 60,000 km 2 (2% of world reserve) of which 20,000 km 2 area has been subject to exploration, as of 2012. But in production it is still within the first 20 countries of the world and also one of its largest importers in line with China, Japan, South Korea and Germany.

Oct 4, 2021Most nonrecycled supplies come from porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) which form when hot metal-bearing fluids percolate up through Earth's crust. .These fluids bubble up through the crust and collect in pores in the rock where they sit waiting for the final step that will allow them to form copper minerals.
