What is Ilmenite? Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks, sediments, and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world. Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith. Ilmenite is a black iron-titanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO 3.. Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium, a metal needed to make a variety of high-performance alloys.

May 30, 2022How is titanium extracted from ilmenite? Titanium is extracted from its ore, rutile - TiO 2. It is first converted into titanium(IV) chloride, which is then reduced to titanium using either magnesium or sodium. The ore rutile (impure titanium(IV) oxide) is heated with chlorine and coke at a temperature of about 1000°C.

## Research on beneficiation technology of ilmenite in a certain place 
Apr 24, 2022Guangxi Bama Tianrun Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. is located in Bama County, Guangxi. It is a well-known ilmenite deposit in western Guangxi and even in China. The ilmenite deposit in this area has been submitted to the Min'an-Pinglin area as a medium-sized ilmenite deposit after pre-investigation by predecessors.

## Beneficiation of Ilmenite from Ultramafic Lamprophyres of Mithapukur 
1. Introduction Titanium is widely used as titanium dioxide (TiO 2) for production of white pigment[1].Ilmenite (FeTiO 3, 52.6% TiO 2 and 47.4% FeO) is the most common source of titanium dioxide[2]. The term Ilmenite, as used in the titanium industry, commonly covers the entire range from unweathered Ilmenite with TiO 2 contents below 50% to altered Ilmenite containing more than 60% TiO 2 [3].
