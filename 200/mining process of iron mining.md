## Everything You Need To Know About Open Pit Mining - Positive Points
Open pit mining is one of mankind's greatest achievements in the ongoing search for precious ores such as copper, silver, iron, and gold. It describes the process of systematically excavating land and digging out the rocks and minerals in search of metallic ores and removing them via borrow or open pit.
