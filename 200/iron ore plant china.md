## Direct reduced iron plant - Global Energy Monitor
Mar 30, 2022Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, and/or fines) into iron with a sponge-like exterior, without melting. [1] The heart of the direct reduction is the shaft furnace, which is filled from the top with lump ore and pellets.
