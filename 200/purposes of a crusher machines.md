Feb 14, 2022The softness and hardness of the material is usually expressed using Mohs hardness, which is divided into ten levels. The higher the level, the harder the material is, the more difficult it is to crush, and the higher the requirements for crushing equipment. For example, the granite has a Mohs hardness of about 6 to 7.

A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.
