## Comparison Grinding Principle of Ball Mill and Vertical Roller Mill
Ball mills and vertical roller mill use different forces to achieve the necessary size reduction of clinker and gypsum plus other materials. In ball milling, the size of the material is progressively reduced through the impact and attrition forces on the feed material as the rotation of the mill causes the tumbling action of the grinding media.
