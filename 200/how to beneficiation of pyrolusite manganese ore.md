## Classification and beneficiation method of manganese ore
Beneficiation method of manganese bearing iron ore. The content of manganese in this kind of ore is low, only 5% - 10%. At the same time, it has the characteristics of fine disseminated particle size and close symbiosis of iron and manganese minerals, so it is difficult to recover by mechanical beneficiation.
