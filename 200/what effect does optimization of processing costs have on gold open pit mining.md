## what effect does optimization of processing costs have on gold open pit 
Hard rock mining, placer mining, byproduct mining and gold ore processing are some methods of gold mining. Each method has its unique process of accessing, extracting and processing gold. Hard rock mining is a method that involves the creation of underground tunnels or open pit mines to access gold in a surrounding rock. Obtener precio

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Open-pit mining
Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

The solution strips away the gold and is collected in a pond, then run through an electro-chemical process to extract the gold. This method of producing gold is cost effective but enormously wasteful: 99.99 percent of the heap becomes waste. Gold mining areas are frequently studded with these immense, toxic piles.

## Application of Lerchs-Grossman Pit Optimization to the Design of Open 
Definition of the optimum open pit, whether an intermediate phase or final design, will be sensitive to many factors. The most basic will include geological and mining constraints, mining and processing costs, pit slopes and product prices. The application of the three dimensional Lerchs-Grossmann pit optimization procedure to this task is described for a range of gold deposits.
