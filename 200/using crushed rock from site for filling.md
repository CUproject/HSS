The various-sized crushed gravel with the fines helps ensure the right amount of compaction. Round rocks, such as pea gravel, roll and dislodge under pressure resulting in failure of the retaining wall. Lay a 4- to 6-inch layer of the crushed base material in the trench. Next, compact it and level it using either a hand or mechanical compactor.

Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab.
