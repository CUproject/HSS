Barite is a major industrial mineral and the source of all barium and barium compounds. Some eight million metric tons of barite are recovered worldwide each year by open-pit mining of barite-rich sandstone. Because of barite's substantial density, crushed ore is easily concentrated by hydraulic, gravitational-separation methods.

## Barite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and
