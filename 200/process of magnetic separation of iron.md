## Magnetic separation equipment | Reading range | Mineral Technologies
The Reading Rare Earth Magnetic Drum (RED) uses a unique 5 pole magnetic element to generate a field intensity in excess of 0.7 Tesla on the drum skin. The magnetic element design affords the maximum field gradient and the 5 poles enables additional cleaning of the magnetic stream. This gives a very selective separation at high throughputs compared to alternative magnetic separators.

## STEINERT HGF - used to separate iron particles from process waters 
Efficient separation of iron particles from process water using the STEINERT HGF high gradient magnetic filter. The finest magnetic particles, usually less than 10 µm, can be separated from liquids and emulsions using the STEINERT matrix separator with "switchable" permanent magnets. Separation rates of well over 80% are common.

## Magnetic separation process at cell sorting
Magnetic separation process at cell sorting. Biomagnetic separation is a technique that uses small superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles and a magnet to separate cells or nucleotides from solution. These particles are often called magnetic nanoparticles or microspheres due to their small sizes ranging from less than 100 nm to 5 μm.

## what mixtures can be separated by magnetic separation
The constituents of a mixture can be separated by physical means like filtration, evaporation, sublimation and magnetic separation. Certain tools such as a sieve/filter, magnet, or evaporation can be used to separate the mixtures. For instance, a magnet can be used to separate iron from a mixture of iron and non-magnetic substances.

## Xinhai Magnetic Separation Process
After the grinding and classification, coarse grain products entered into Xinhai jig for separating, fine grain was sent into Xinhai magnetic separator for stong magnetic separation, and then qualified manganese ore concentrate and tailings were obtained. Process Indicator: Ore grade: 28.29%; Concentrate grade: 82.03%; Recovery rate: 68.69%.
