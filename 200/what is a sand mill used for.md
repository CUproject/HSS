## 4 Differences between vertical Sand Mill and Horizontal Sand Mill
Aug 26, 2021Sand mills, also known as bead mills, are mainly used for wet grinding of chemical liquid products. According to the performance, the sand mill machine can be divided into horizontal sand mills, basket sand mills, and vertical sand mills. Among them, the most widely used are horizontal sand mills and vertical sand mills.
