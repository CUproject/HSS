## Potash | METS Engineering
Sep 17, 2021Potash or potassium salts are produced through two primary sources; brines and evaporite deposits. The two most common and economically important potassium sources are sulfate of potash (K2SO4 - SOP) and muriate of potash (KCl - MOP). Evaporite deposits are usually quite deep, and are either mined through underground mining or in-situ solution mining.

Mar 10, 2021The potash chemistry includes salts that are formed by combining four key cations, K+, Na+, Mg+2 and Ca+2 and the two key anions, Cl- and SO4-2. This chemistry is very complex because of a large number of possible combinations of salts and their hydrates in multicomponent mixtures that may form at each temperature.

Potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus are the three macro-nutrients vital for plant growth. Potassium helps the "blood flow" of the plant, enabling sugars and waters to move around. It thickens cell walls, protects against drought and helps the plant defend against disease. Potassium naturally occurs in soils to varying degrees.

A flowchart is a visual representation of the sequence of steps and decisions needed to perform a process. Each step in the sequence is noted within a diagram shape. Steps are linked by connecting lines and directional arrows. This allows anyone to view the flowchart and logically follow the process from beginning to end.

Potash processing About 70% of the total potash, and almost 90% of fertilizer grade potassium chloride is produced by conventional froth flotation, sometimes supplemented by heavy media separation. Crystallization is used mainly to produce industrial grade and specialty fertilizer grade (white muriate) potash.

## Mining Potash for Fertilizer - Advancing Mining
More than 60% of the potash produced was MOP. Potash mining. Today, potash comes from either underground or solution mining. Underground potash deposits come from evaporated sea beds. Boring machines dig out the ore, which is transported to the surface to the processing mill, where the raw ore is crushed and refined to extract the potassium salts.
