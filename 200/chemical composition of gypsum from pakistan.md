## An Overview of Pakistan Rock Salt Resources and Their Chemical  - PJSIR
Jul 5, 2021Rock salt is of importance for both humans and industries. In this study, we discussed the main salt deposits in Pakistan by evaluating the total reserves as well as the rock salt annual production and by characterizing their chemical composition (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, B+, K+, Li+, Cl-, SO42-, Br- and NO3-). Our objectives were to document their impurity, water-insoluble matter and moisture

##  Plaster of Paris - Gypsum
Plaster of Paris is de-hydrated gypsum. Gypsum is a naturally forming non-metallic mineral, found as a rock or sand composed of 70.1% calcium sulphate and 20.9% water by weight. Its chemical formula is CaSO 4 Â· 2H 2O. Gypsum is found naturally in most parts of the world with plentiful supplies in Canada and the United States.

Plaster of Paris is created from fine ground gypsum that has been heated to 160 degrees, a process called calcining. The heating process removes moisture from the gypsum, altering its chemistry and creating a fine powder . When mixed with water it can be manipulated in many ways, from sculptures to modeling, but a basic plaster of Paris mixture.

## feldspar - Chemical composition | Britannica
Chemical composition. All the rock-forming feldspars are alumino silicate minerals with the general formula AT4 O 8 in which A = potassium, sodium, or calcium (Ca); and T = silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al), with a Si:Al ratio ranging from 3:1 to 1:1. Microcline and orthoclase are potassium feldspars (KAlSi 3 O 8 ), usually designated Or in

## composition and method to make fertilizer from gypsum
Sample of soil, shovel, 1 quart jar, water, sand with varying particle sizes, organic fertilizers and compost, organic matter, sawdust powder, dolomite, gypsum. Procedure Step #1: Taking the Soil Sample Soil sample can be taken by digging 4-5 holes, each having a depth of about 5-9 inches. The soil samples taken need not be more than an inch wide.
