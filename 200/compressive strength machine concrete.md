## Concrete Compression Testing Machines | Strength Testing - Gilson Co.
Standard Concrete Compression Machines offer a choice of two different electronic controllers with full-range accuracy of ±0.5% and functionality to print or download hundreds of stored test results for reporting and documentation. Pro Controllers simultaneously display live load and rate of load during testing.

## Compressive strength prediction of high-strength concrete using machine 
4 days agoVarious machine learning (ML) techniques were used for carrying out these tasks. Because of the absence of any empirical relation between the compressive strength of concrete and the new and upcoming concrete mixtures, machine learning techniques have been put to use for the predictions of various mechanical properties of concrete.
