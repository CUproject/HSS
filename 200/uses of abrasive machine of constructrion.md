## Introduction and Uses of Abrasive Materials
Abrasive materials. Abrasive materials are the general term for coated abrasives, wire-drawing abrasives, and polishing abrasives, which mainly grind, wire-draw, and polish the surface of the workpiece. Abrasive materials generally have high hardness, toughness, and regular shape. Abrasive materials belong to the category of "hardware tools". 2.

## What Is Abrasive Jet Machining and How Does It Work?
Sep 9, 2020Also known as pencil blasting, abrasive jet machining is a machining process used in the manufacturing industry to remove unwanted material from a workpiece. It lives up to its namesake by blasting a workpiece with hard and abrasive particles. The particles are propelled at a high velocity via a gas. As a result, they are able to erode material

## Water Jet Machining - Working Principle  - Mechanical Booster
Water Jet Machining (WJM) also called water jet cutting, is a non-traditional machining process in which high-velocity jet of water is used to remove materials from the surface of the workpiece. WJM can be used to cut softer materials like plastic, rubber or wood. In order to cut harder materials like metals or granite, an abrasive material is mixed in the water.
