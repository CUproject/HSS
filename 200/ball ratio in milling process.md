If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.

The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%

## Ball Ratio In Milling Process
Ball Ratio In Milling Process. Jun 15, 2014 The ball to powder ratio (BPR) is a processing parameter that is frequently used in both mechanical (ball) milling and mechanical alloying.  Then, the optimal mass ratio of ball to powder in ball mill is 7.524/(2.517.6)= 4.09 to 7.521/(2.511.2) = 5.63. References Austin, L. G., Klimpel, R. R

## ball ratio in milling process
Ball Milling Pretreatment of Stover for Enhancing the. Meanwhile the results indicate that the treatment effect of wet milling is better than that of dry milling The optimum parameters for the milling process were ball speed of 350 r/min solid/liquid ratio of 1 10 raw material particle size with 05 mm and number of balls of 20 steel ball
