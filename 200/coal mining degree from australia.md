Coal Geoscience Australia. In Australia,nearly 80% of coal is produced from open-cut mines in contrast with the rest of the world where open-cut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Open-cut mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the in situ resource.
