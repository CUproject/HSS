Sep 20, 2021Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.

Gravel Mining Operations. Gravel mining operations on Wynoochee River being excavated by dragline, Courtesy: Kondolf, 1994. Operations include the wet excavation of riverbeds for gravels and the dry pumped excavation of floodplains. The advantage in the later method is the ease of excavation, whereas the pumping comes at a cost as well.
