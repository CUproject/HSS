## Ghana - Mining Industry Equipment - International Trade Administration
Jul 22, 2022Ghana is Africa's largest gold producer; it overtook South Africa in 2019 with 4.8 million ounces in output. Gold is the most commercially exploited mineral in Ghana, accounting for about 95% of the country's mineral revenue. Other commercially exploited minerals in Ghana are manganese, bauxite, and diamonds.

## A History of Government Regulations Imposed on the Mining Industry
The Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952 introduced a range of new regulations. The act introduced annual mine inspections for the first time, and it gave the BOM the power to issue violation notices and withdrawal orders. The act also allowed the BOM to fine mining companies that failed to comply with orders or allow inspectors access to mines.
