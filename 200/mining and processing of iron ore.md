## A Underground Method of Mining Iron Ore
Rock-filling is now being used in the ninth level, from which 130,000 tons of ore, it is estimated, will be mined this year. The drawings, Figs. 5, 6 and 7, show the method of this filling. From the main shaft " A," a drift cuts the ore-body and 25 feet into the foot-wall of firm jasper-slates.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Iron Ore Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In India, where iron ore processing is one of the major industries, the generation of tailings is estimated to be 10-25 % of the total iron ore mined, amounting to 18 million tons per year (Das et al., 2000 ). The tailings contain silica in high percentage (40-60 %, from various locations). This makes it a suitable raw material for the
