## cost to process gold ore
For example, lets say that a mine was processing ore valued at 1 troy ounce of gold per ton. This would generally be considered a very high-grade ore, worth mining in most cases. Using this hypothetical value of 1 ozt./ton, each pound of ore would contain approximately 0.0005 ounces of gold. Now let's assume that gold is valued at $1500 per

gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms
