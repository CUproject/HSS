Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling, which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage, extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing, grinding, wet or dry concentration.

## Phosphate Beneficiation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Phosphate Beneficiation Flowsheet Phosphate Ore Mining.  With reclamation of plant water from the slime tailing in a thickener, the amount of new water for low and medium grade ores will be about 300 gallons per ton of ore treated. High grade ores require about 150 gallons per ton. This is well within the range of average mill water
