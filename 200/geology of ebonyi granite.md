## Granite Rocks : What Is Granite Rock And How Is It Formed?
Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with a volume of between 20% and 60% and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar, although the term "granite" is commonly used to refer to a wider range of coarse-grained igneous rocks with quartz and feldspar. The term "granite" is used for granite and a group of
