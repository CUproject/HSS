Dec 18, 2020Vesta Montour No. 4 Mine was once the largest bituminous coal mine in the world. The mine was opened circa 1903, was closed in 1957, was temporarily re-opened in 1960, and permanently closed in 1984. Bituminous coal was first mined in Pennsylvania at "Coal Hill" (Mount Washington), just across the Monongahela River from the city of Pittsburgh.

May 1, 2021To perform depreciation calculation, first, we must find the depreciable amount.. Depreciable amount = Cost of an asset - residual value. It is important to remember that residual value is the amount that a company expects to receive from the sale of an asset after a certain period of use.. Depreciable amount = 15,000,000 - 3,000,000 (15,000,000 x20%)

##  Depreciation and Early Plant Retirements
Depreciation cost accounting, measuring asset value decline over time, allocates original cost over service life. In the regulated utility context, it also records cumulative depreciation costs already recovered through rates in a "depreciation reserve" account representing investment return and deduction from rate base valuation.
