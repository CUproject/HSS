The invention concerns a process and an apparatus for separating powdery materials shaped as balls or pellets. It is characterized by the use of a vibrating screw elevator (4) subjected to vibrations of an amplitude so selected as to produce on the screw turns (5), an upward flow of the particles to be removed, while maintaining a downward flow of the particles to be recovered.

You are right to consider the white balls (there are $5$) and the red balls (there are $4$) together. Call them pink. Given an arrangement of $9$ pink balls and $3$ blue balls, you can make the first $5$ pink balls white and the last $4$ pink balls red to obtain an arrangement of the balls where the white balls all come before the red balls
