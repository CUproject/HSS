## Ball Mills : United Nuclear, Scientific Equipment & Supplies, United 
To use the Mill, the material to be ground is loaded into the barrel which contains grinding media. As the barrel rotates, the material is caught between the individual grinding media balls which mix and crush the product into a very fine powder over a period of several hours. Quite simply, the longer the Ball Mill is run, the finer powder will be.
