## Despite its losses, the gold market continues to outperform most other 
1 day agoDecember gold futures last traded at $1,646.90 an ounce, down 0.53% on the day. "In fact, gold has done much better than inflation-linked bonds both in the U.S. and elsewhere. And we believe that gold's performance so far this year reflects the behavior of its underlying drivers," he said in the report.

## The Dangers of Cyanide in Gold Mining - Peer Ledger
Jul 2, 2021Gold mining can be extremely dangerous and one of the most harmful practices is the use of cyanide to extract the precious metal from the rock. Fortunately, there are a range of innovators trying to eliminate this notorious poison from the mining process. Since the mid-1800s, cyanide has been considered a cheap and effective way to separate

Gravity surveys have been used, with great success, to locate diamonds. Diamonds typically are found in characteristic kimberlite pipes that are dense compared to nearby rocks, leading to a spike in the local gravity. In addition to and oil diamonds, gravity surveys play a part in confirming and mapping potential deposits of most rare minerals.

A magnetometer or a compass is a navigation device that measures the strength of the magnetic field or magnetic dipole moment. A magnetometer is an instrument with a sensor that measures the magnetic flux density. Magnetometers determine the direction, strength, or relative variation in the magnetic field at a certain location.

## Can a Magnetometer Detect Gold? - Geometrics : Geometrics
Placer gold is the type found in buried stream channels such as the gold which sparked the California gold-rush in 1849. Gold dust and magnetic minerals have been concentrated in river banks over thousands of years. Where there is gold there is often magnetite and therefore the magnetometer can be used to locate placer gold deposits.

Magnetometers are widely used for measuring the Earth's magnetic field, in geophysical surveys, to detect magnetic anomalies of various types, and to determine the dipole moment of magnetic materials. In an aircraft's attitude and heading reference system, they are commonly used as a heading reference.
