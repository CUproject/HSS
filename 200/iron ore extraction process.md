Sulphur has to be removed first in a separate process. Magnesium powder is blown through the molten iron and the sulfur reacts with it to form magnesium sulfide. This forms a slag on top of the iron and can be removed.  Avoiding the pollution problems in the extraction of iron from the ore. Not having to find space to dump the unwanted iron

China has faced a significant blow due to such laws as it is the biggest importer of iron ore. Huge Capital Requirements. Iron ore mining requires substantial capital investments due to energy-intensive nature of the extraction process. For instance, the average cost of an iron ore project was around US$236/tonne of capacity in 2014.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals.  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier.

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

##  Green Extraction Technology for The Extraction of Iron From Iron Ore Fines
EXTRACTION OF IRON FROM IRON ORE FINES Glawdis Shungu Tshofu  and solid to liquid ratio had significant effects on the leaching process. The highest iron extraction of 97.7% was obtained at 140 °C, 0.025:1 solid to liquid ratio and a particle size of 106 to 150 µm after 48 hours. An adapted form of the shrinking core
