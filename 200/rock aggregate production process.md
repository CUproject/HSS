## Assessment of Rock Aggregate Quality Through the Analytic Hierarchy 
The present study introduces an AHP methodology for the evaluation of rock aggregate quality in terms of bituminous paving mixtures. For the AHP analyses, four rock types and five evaluation criteria (C 1 -C 5) were established. The AHP analysis results indicate that the methodology followed in this study could be suitable for the evaluation

## cement - Extraction and processing | Britannica
Extraction and processing. Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing
