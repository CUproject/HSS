Iron ore is primarily found as the oxides of iron, notably hematite and magnetite and as hydroxides like goethite and limonite. Small amounts are found as the carbonates in siderite, as sulphides in pyrites and as silicates in chamosite and greenalite. Indian economy is growing steel demand and supply will grow in the same way.

## magnetite iron ore beneficiation technology in zimbabwe
Aug 08, 2019 · Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore, and magnetite, as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification. Hematite, however, responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite, so it is the preferred type of ore.
