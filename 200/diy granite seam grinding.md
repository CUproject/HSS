## Seam Granite . there IS a wrong way to do it
A seam is the transition line that forms when two granite tops come together. The void between the tops should be filled with epoxy or polyester glue, colored with pigment to match your granite tops. Some installers use silicone so the countertop pieces can move. I find silicone seams to be impractical and a poor choice.

Oct 14, 2020The seam is a filled space or gap between two pieces of granite.

Set up granite on a stable work surface and clamp it down. Measure and mark the cut line. To minimize chip-out, cover the cut line with blue tape. Remeasure and mark the tape. If using a circular saw, blue-tape the shoe of the saw to minimize the risk of metal-on-granite scratching.
