##  Effectiveness of the Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Operation in 
Looking at the change in the power sector from 2010 to 2020, there is a reduction in power generation by thermal coal plants. Reports indicate a 30% reduction in power generation from coal fired thermal plants [7, 16, 18]. This is aligned with the reduction of CO 2 released into the atmosphere from coal and gas plants [5, 12].

Like any thermal power station, we generate electricity from steam. Our entire process can be simplified into four main steps: Fuel is burned to create heat. By using finely pulverized coal, efficient combustion is assured and high temperatures are achieved. The heat is applied to demineralized water inside the boiler, turning it into steam.

A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

Simply put, coal-fired electricity generation is a five-step process: Thermal coal (either black or brown) that has been pulverised to a fine powder is burned. The resulting heat is used to turn water into steam. The steam at very high pressure is then used to spin a turbine, connected to an electrical generator.

During a coal-fired plant's decommissioning process, the electric-generating equipment—such as precipitators, boilers, turbines, and generators—are shut down and operating permits are terminated.Unused coal and materials associated with both the generation process and the buildings and structures are removed. The electric-generating equipment may be used at other plants or sold as scrap.

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated.

The crushed coal then continues up the conveyor into the plant and stored in a bunker. From the bunker, the coal passes through a pulverizer, which grinds it until it is a fine powder. This makes the coal highly flammable, so it ignites and burns immediately when blown into the furnace. A coal grinder for Unit 1 at Nebraska City Station.

A coal fired power plant is the most inefficient source of energy; it is costly and environmentally hazardous. This is how it works: Firstly the coal is dig from the mines and is supplied to the location where the coal-fired power plant is set up. This supply is made through a highway truck, railways or a barge.

## Managing Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants Efficiently
Managing Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants Efficiently. This article identifies areas where installation of instrumentation and controls can bring about energy efficiency, safety and cost reduction in the primary cost components of a coal fired thermal station, viz., coal, fuel oil, water and auxiliary power - M Siddhartha Bhatt, N Rajkumar.

##  Upgrading and efficiency improvement in coal-fired power plants - USEA
Upgrading and efficiency improvement in coal-fired power plants 5 The efficiencies of coal-fired plants will normally decrease over time as components suffer deterioration with age and use. The losses that develop in the earlier part of the life of a plant are generally containable by employing good operating and maintenance practices.
