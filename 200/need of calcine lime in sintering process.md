## Need Of Calcine Lime In Sintering Process
 The total reaction involved in the process of sintering is the sum of a number of reactions which involve reactions in heating zone, reactions in sintering zone and reactions in cooling zone. These reactions are illustrated schematically for typical sintering of a lime-fluxed haematite ore in Fig. 11.
