## Frac Sand Loading Process At Black Mountain Sand
The truck proceeds to its load lane. Once the truck is inside the proper silo, a spout is lowered and the trailer/container is filled with sand. It takes approximately 2.5 minutes to load each truck with twenty-three tons of sand. As the truck pulls forward, its exit weight is recorded, which helps ensure it has received the proper amount of

## Frac Sand Drying Methods: Rotary vs. Fluid Bed
The frac sand industry utilizes both types of dryers. Rotary dryers are the more expensive of the two, but they are more forgiving and allow greater process turndown capability. Fluid bed dryers cost less, are more thermally efficient and have minimal maintenance due to fewer moving parts. When taking into account certain frac sand drying

Frac sand is high-purity quartz sand that plays a significant role in the fracing process. When high-pressure water forces the shales open, frac sand is injected to prevent them from closing, allowing the continued release of fossil fuels.

What Is Frac Sand? "Frac sand" is a high-purity quartz sand with very durable and very round grains. It is a crush-resistant material produced for use by the petroleum industry. It is used in the hydraulic fracturing process (known as "fracking") to produce petroleum fluids, such as oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids from rock units that lack adequate pore space for these fluids to flow

Frac Sand Mining. Hydraulic fracturing uses high pressure water to break open underground geologic formations - most commonly shale. - containing oil and gas. Once the shale is fractured, if the fractures are not propped open, they will close again. So frackers use frack sand to prop open the fractures to allow the oil and gas to be extracted.

How Frac Sand is Used: Frac Sand is used when extracting subsurface minerals like oil, natural gas, or natural gas liquids. Acquiring these minerals is achieved through a process called fracking. Fracking is accomplished by drilling a well into the rock being targeted. Once drilled, the portion of the well in the petroleum-bearing zone is sealed.
