The Silver Extraction Process. The ore as mined was not pure as it was mostly encased in rock, combined with earth, and also contained traces of iron ore and other minerals Firstly it had to be pounded into small fragments on stone tables with rock hammers, then ground to a fine powder of 1-mm grain size in a stone,

September 13, 2013. Marble deposits can be exploited in open pits, it can be 95% on outdoor quarries and 5% in caves or mines. Marble is located at ground level or at great depths which make the cost too high for removal. Formerly, the extraction of this stone was done manually with wooden wedges, halters, ropes, picks and shovels.

A process called "pressure oxidation" is used to oxidize the gold-bearing materials. The oxidized material is mixed with a cyanide solution in large tanks inside the mill. The gold dissolves in the cyanide. The dissolved gold is then collected onto activated carbon, and the cyanide solution is sent to a cyanide-detox unit.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
