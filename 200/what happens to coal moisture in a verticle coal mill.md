Pollution from coal utilization. Coal utilization is associated with various forms of air pollution.During the incomplete burning or conversion of coal, many compounds are produced, some of which are carcinogenic.The burning of coal also produces sulfur and nitrogen oxides that react with atmospheric moisture to produce sulfuric and nitric acids—so-called acid rain.
