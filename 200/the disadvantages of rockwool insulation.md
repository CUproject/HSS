## Rockwool vs Fiberglass: 11 Main Differences You Didn't Know
Aug 29, 2022Regarding soundproofing, the rule of thumb is that the higher the density of the material, the better soundproofing effect it has. Rockwool has a density of 1.7 pounds per cubic foot, while fiberglass only has a density of 0.5 to 1.0. Thus, Rockwool provides better sound insulation than fiberglass.

## Is Denim Insulation Good for Soundproofing? The Answer May Surprise You
May 22, 2022Denim is low density and decreases thermal conductivity, so less movement of heat or cold. That means it is good for home and sound insulation and why it is LEED-certified. Denim has a multi-dimensional micro-structure. It controls sound by isolating and trapping sound waves. The insulation is 80 to 85% recycled content.

## What Are the Dangers of Rockwool? | Hunker
Rockwool has a melting point around 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. If there is an older form of rockwool in a home, the primary danger is that it will burn well. If your home was built prior to 1960 and contains rockwool insulation, it is important to keep its flammability in mind. The newer forms of rockwool do not possess this flammability problem.

## Disadvantages of fibreglass roofingigns
Another major downside to fiberglass insulation is that the insulation can settle over time. As the insulation settles, its "R" value decreases. Additionally, fiberglass batts do not seal walls and cannot be installed into small holes. This usually means that there are areas where hot or cold air can escape.
