Aug 20, 2018· Coal ore extraction involves both surface (open-pit) and underground mining techniques. The method selected depends on a variety of factors, including the nature and location of the deposit, size, depth, and grade of the deposit (Norgate and Haque, 2010).Surface mining operates in two distinct stages, overburden removal and coal extraction, as well as the recovery of the mined area.
