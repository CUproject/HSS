## Gold Mining Methods
Placer mining takes a variety of forms, including panning, "sluice-boxing", hydraulic mining, and dredging. All of these techniques use gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the lighter sand and gravel. Some modern commercial placer operations are quite large and utilize heavy equipment and river diversions.

## Best Mining Stocks: 7 Picks To Buy in 2022 | GOBankingRates
7 days agoMining stocks have long been attractive to investors for a couple of reasons. First, the demand for raw ore is only increasing as more and more companies use them in manufacturing. As more natural materials are mined, there is less left to mine, which should, theoretically at least, drive up prices. Plus, mining stocks often pay a dividend, which is attractive to many buy-and-hold investors

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
