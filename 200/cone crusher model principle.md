## cone crusher dynamic
Cone crusher adopts the principle of laminated crushing; its crushing efficiency is higher than that of traditional crusher. But there are different types of cone crushers, and their output is also different.  The dynamic cone crusher model describes the crusher chamber as a surge bin and predicts the product particle sizes based on crusher

## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.
