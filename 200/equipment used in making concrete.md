## What Is Shoring Equipment Used For? | Concrete Forms and Shoring 
When wooden plates are used instead of steel plates, the process is known as soldier boarding. Shoring vs. Shielding. It's important to note that trench shoring is not the same as trench shielding, and the equipment used in each is different. Trench shielding is the technique used to keep workers safe if the trench were to collapse.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
