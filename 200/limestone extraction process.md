The Extraction Process. To extract rock and mineral from the Earth, roads must be built to move heavy machinery to where the raw material is. This alone can upset nature in its natural state.  Limestone. Extracting limestone could impact the habitats of the animals that live in limestone caves, and could reduce biodiversity as well.

Extraction and processing. Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing

September 13, 2013. Marble deposits can be exploited in open pits, it can be 95% on outdoor quarries and 5% in caves or mines. Marble is located at ground level or at great depths which make the cost too high for removal. Formerly, the extraction of this stone was done manually with wooden wedges, halters, ropes, picks and shovels.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

The Solvay process or ammonia-soda process is the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash, Na 2 CO 3).The ammonia-soda process was developed into its modern form by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay during the 1860s. The ingredients for this are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from quarries).

## Iron Extraction and Purification / Steel | ChemKey
Mild steel is iron containing up to about 0.25% of carbon. The presence of the carbon makes the steel stronger and harder than pure iron. The higher the percentage of carbon, the harder the steel becomes. Mild steel is used for lots of things - nails, wire, car bodies, ship building, girders and bridges amongst others.
