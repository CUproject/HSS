usa - method for beneficiation of magnesite ore. A method for beneficiation of magnesite ore wherein the ore is subjected to calcination to decrease the bulk density of the magnesite relative to the gangue. Accordingly, after such calcination, conventional gravimetric separations can be conducted with greatly increased efficiency.
