## Manganese steel wear liners — SRP
Austenitic manganese steel - steel alloyed with more than 10% manganese - is work-hardening. That means that high impacts - like those in a crushing chamber for example - cause the formation of a extremely hard surface layer that is two to three times harder than the rest of the alloy If impacted enough, this results in a hard exterior layer backed by a softer core.
