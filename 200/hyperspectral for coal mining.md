This study explores the feasibility of using hyperspectral remote sensing to determine the heavy metal (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) content of soils in a coal-mining area in the city of Zoucheng, Shandong Province, China. We used a plasma mass spectrometer to measure the heavy metal contents of

## Hyperspectral analysis of soil organic matter in coal mining regions 
Hyperspectral estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) in coal mining regions is an important tool for enhancing fertilization in soil restoration programs. The correlation—partial least squares regression (PLSR) method effectively solves the information loss problem of correlation—multiple linear stepwise regression, but results of the correlation analysis must be optimized to improve
