## Diamond Grinding vs. Micromilling - EMTSP
Diamond grinding of Portland cement concrete pavements and micro-milling of bituminous asphalt pavements are superficially similar in concept, but that's just about the only thing they have in common. Diamond grinding of aging Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements renews the pavement's skid-resistance, and provides a smoother-riding

A small planetary concrete grinder with basic grinding tools will remove around 1/16" of the concrete in 1-2 passes in a normal situation. You might be able to remove more - 1/8'' if use a heavier concrete grinder and more aggressive PCD tools. In fact, an angle grinder with a cup wheel will do the best job.

Diamond grinding is done with specially designed equipment that uses gang-mounted diamond saw blades to cut through bumps in the concrete surface. In essence, the function of diamond grinding equipment is similar to that of a common wood plane. The saw blades shave off the fault or bump and the rear wheels follow behind in the smoothened path.

Two types of paving operations are used for the construction of rigid pavement. One is fixed-form paving, and the other is slip-form paving. Both methods have some common operations as further delineated here. First, both methods require accurate survey controls that are used to establish the proper alignment and grade of the concrete pavement.
