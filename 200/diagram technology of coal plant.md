## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? - Bright Hub Engineering
Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants, while producing power, require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2. Learn how the process works as well as interesting

Coal plays a dual role in the Kiln. Part of coal is used as fuel to supply the desired heat so as to take the raw materials to the desired temp. But main role of coal is to supply carbon in the reduction process. Dolomite is used as sulphur scavenger which finally comes out with the char. Char contains ash of coal and other impurities of iron ore.

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

Sep 23, 2021A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

IGCC. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is a technology that uses a high-pressure gasifier to convert coal or other carbon-based fuels into pressurized gas. The synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen, can be used to drive a combined cycle turbine, a cleaner way of burning coal.
