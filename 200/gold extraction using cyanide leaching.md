How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining. The Cyanide Leaching Process has been the most widely used and most cost effective method of extracting gold from ore since the 1970's. Most open-pit gold mining operations around the world use a heap leaching to extract ores from these types of deposits.

Cyanide process which is also known as the Macarthur-forest process is widely used in extracting gold or silver from the ores by dissolving them in a dilute solution of potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide. This process was introduced in the year 1887 by Scottish chemists named Robert W. Forrest, John S. MacArthur, and William Forrest.

A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

## Gold Leaching Agent Compared to Cyanide in Gold Processing
Cyanide leaching is a process in which solid natural gold in ore or beneficiation product forms a gold-cyanide complex dissolved in water under the combined action of a leaching agent, an oxidizing agent and a base, that is, a phase transformation process of solid phase gold. Chemical reaction formula for gold leaching: 4Au+8KCN+2H2O→4KAu (CN

## ExAurum Eco-friendly Gold Leaching Reagent
Usage: while being used, the non-cyanide gold extraction reagent must be agitated with alkaline water at normal temperature, and then dissolved in a slurry to do gold leaching. In the process of heap leaching, pool leaching and CIP production of oxidized gold ore, the process is as same as the process of using sodium cyanide.
