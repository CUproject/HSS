## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.
