## Graphene in Clinker Greens Portland Cement - Concrete Products
Jul 8, 2022Reducing the CO 2 footprint is key to the cement and concrete industry's goal, yet in a scientific irony, adding a little bit of carbon to concrete will go a long way toward reaching that goal. Mike Bell, CEO of First Graphene Ltd. (https://firstgraphene), cites numerous academic works over the past several decades that clearly indicate

## Cement and Concrete Sustainability
There are the many reasons why concrete is a sustainable building material: Long life - Concrete structures are long-lived, such as pavements that have an average service life of 30-50 years. Low life-cycle cost - Concrete consumes minimum materials, energy and other resources for construction, and requires little to no maintenance throughout
