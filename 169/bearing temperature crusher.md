Pumps. Depending on the application, normal bearing operating temperatures in pumps range from 100°F to 180°F, with most running between 140°F and 160°F. Although grease is used in some vertical pumps, oil is the preferred lubricant in the majority of pump applications. Standard bearing oils in pumps remain effective to approximately 180°F.
