Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.
