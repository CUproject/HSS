## Mica Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Most sheet mica is mined in India, where labor costs are comparatively low. Flake Mica Mining: The flake mica produced in the U.S. comes from several sources: the metamorphic rock called schist as a by-product of processing feldspar and kaolin resources, from placer deposits, and from pegmatites. It is mined by conventional open-pit methods.
