## From mine to port - LKAB
From mine to port. Everything starts in the mine, with our iron ore. It is the foundation of our operations and a prerequisite for leading the transformation of our industry towards a sustainable future. This is the story about the road from mining iron ore underground to loading the ships in our harbours with highly upgraded products.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## A Underground Method of Mining Iron Ore
Rock-filling is now being used in the ninth level, from which 130,000 tons of ore, it is estimated, will be mined this year. The drawings, Figs. 5, 6 and 7, show the method of this filling. From the main shaft " A," a drift cuts the ore-body and 25 feet into the foot-wall of firm jasper-slates.
