The method has to be chosen right in the beginning. The choice will depend upon the size of the quarry, the nature of the rock and the demand for building stones. (ii) Preparation of a layout: In accordance with the method selected for quarrying of stones, a scheme or layout for quarrying will be prepared.

In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

Limestone, gypsum, granite, marble, sandstone and slate are just a few of the many quarried materials. A great deal of work goes into determining quarry location and size where quality blocks can be extracted. Specialized drill bits are used to remove core samples. Those samples are then tested to ensure suitability.

Aggregates of different grain sizes for testing. From left to right: manufactured sand of 1-1.25 mm and 4-5 mm, fine aggregate of 10-12.5 mm and 20-25 mm. The general idea is that the smaller the aggregate size, the more we need equipment to produce it. Production of aggregate starts typically from 800 mm pieces of blasted material.
