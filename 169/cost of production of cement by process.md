Fuel and electricity costs are the single largest variable production cost at cement mill plants. Variable costs are typically about 50% of overall operating costs, so energy cost is usually the single largest production cost, besides raw materials. Labor cost is relatively a small part of the Cement Manufacturing Plant.

## Process Technology of Cement Production (In-Class Training)
Clinker production is the most energy-intensive process step in cement manufacturing. It can represent up to 90 % of the total energy demand in a cement plant and is therefore a main focus not only with regard to cost optimisation and quality improvement of the final product, but also regarding emission control and the reduction of impacts on

## Cost Of Production Of Cement By Process
Production Planning Using Dayahead Prices In A Cement . Jan 01, 2018 Cement production is an energy-intensive process. The cost of energy constitutes more than 60% of the cost of the cement; hence cement plants have to consider minimizing the cost of energy when planning production.

## Reducing energy consumption of a raw mill in cement industry
Cement production in the world is currently about 1.6 billion ton per year. About 2% of the electricity produced in the whole world is used during the grinding process of raw materials .While total electrical energy consumption for cement production is about 100 kWh/ton of cement, roughly two thirds are used for particle size reduction .About 65% of the total electrical energy used in a cement
