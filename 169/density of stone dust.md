## Stone Specialist
The absolute, or real density can be determined by crushing the stone to dust so that there are no physical voids or pores. A measured amount of the crushed stone is added to water within either a pycnometer or Le Chatelier volumenometer. The real density is determined by either the increase in weight or the increase in volume, respectively.

## Density of Construction Materials in kg/m3 and lb/ft3
Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.

Stone dust has lesser fraction of soil passing 0.075 mm sieve and is non-plastic in nature. This helps to improve the gradation and plasticity of the soil when mixed with stone dust. Stone Dust consists of angular particles having more interlocking strength which improves the density of the soil when mixed with stone dust.
