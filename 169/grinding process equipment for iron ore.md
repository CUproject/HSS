## Iron Ore Pelletization - FEECO International Inc.
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized - a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

## Iron Ore,Production Process of Iron Ore,Iron Ore Beneficiation flow 
Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, gravity concentration etc, gradually we can get iron from natural minerals (iron ore). It is the mineral aggregates that contain iron or iron compounds which can be used economically. Production Process of Iron Ore

## Iron Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC Machine
Jaw crusher reduces the hard iron ore into a smaller size, it has a high iron crushing ratio, feeding and crushing capacity, uniform texture, good grain shape. Ball mill is the key equipment for grinding iron ore particles after crushing. The purpose is to achieve sufficient dissociation of useful minerals to achieve a better beneficiation effect.
