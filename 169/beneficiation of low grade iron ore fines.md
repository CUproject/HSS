## Beneficiation of Low/Off Grade Iron Ore: a Review
Due to gradual depletion of high-grade iron ores (65-77 % of Fe) has develop the maximum possibility of utilization of low-grade iron ore. But this required much more economical support. Many literature highlight that upgrading the fines ores utilizing this fraction in the sinter feed up to 40% by micro-balling of the sinter prior to sintering

The consumption of iron ore has increased rapidly over the past decade due to the tremendous growth of iron and steel industry. The depletion of high grade iron ore resources make it inevitable to utilize the existing low grade iron ores/fines/tailings with effective beneficiation to meet the present specification and demand. Enormous amounts of fines are produced both from the natural

## Dry beneficiation of low-grade goethite-rich iron ore fines by air 
In mining and minerals industries, whenever water supplies are restricted and also where wet processing leads to problems in handling and dewatering of the products and tailings, dry beneficiation is preferred. Moreover, the decrease in available high-grade iron ores has generated a need to develop alternative beneficiation processes for processing low-grade iron ores.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Several methods/techniques such as jigging, washing, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are being used to enhance the iron percentage in the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. Iron ore is normally beneficiated utilizing the

## Iron ore, its beneficiation and agglomeration - Blogger
D. Beneficiation of Ore: Very low grade Iron ore cannot be used in metallurgical plants and needs to be upgraded to increase the iron content and reduce the Gauge content. A process adopted to upgrade ore is called Beneficiation.  Sinter is a clinker like aggregate which is normally produced from relatively coarser fine iron ore (normally
