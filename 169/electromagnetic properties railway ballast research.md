NIR sauna uses incandescent light bulbs in order to harness a broader spectrum that includes therapeutically beneficial light bands—namely, red light wavelengths, and near- infrared wavelengths. These bands of light have been scientifically proven to yield benefits for humans—and they happen to be the same ones harnessed in red light therapy.

## Railroad Ballast Evaluation Using Ground-Penetrating Radar: Laboratory 
The early detection of ballast fouling is of utmost importance to the safety of the rail system and its life-cycle cost-effectiveness. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR), a nondestructive evaluation tool, has shown its potential as a means of assessing the condition of the railroad substructure rapidly, effectively, and continuously.

## Railway Ballast | Function Of Stones In Railway Track - AGICO
The function of ballast in railway track. Ballast is a common trackbed structure in the railway transport system, which is used to support track sleepers. A layer of crushed stones will be laid on the roadbed before the tracks are laid, which will then be compacted. Then sleepers and tracks will be laid. Distribute the pressure of the sleepers

Railroad ballast plays an important role in supporting heavy rail load-ing, preventing track deformation, and providing water drainage from the track structure. However, over time, the ballast is fouled by the breakdown of ballast or the inﬁltration of ﬁnes, which under-mines the ballast functions and which may result in damage to the rail
