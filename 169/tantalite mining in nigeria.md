## Limult Tantalite Mining and Processing Factory in Nigeria
Jun 25, 2021Tantalum comes from the processing and refining of tantalite. Tantalite is the common name for any mineral ore containing tantalum. Most tantalum mines are open pit; some are underground. The process of mining tantalum involves blasting, crushing and transporting the resulting ore to begin the process of freeing the tantalum.

## tantalite mining
Apr 24, 2017Â· Tantalum comes from the processing and refining of tantalite. Tantalite is the common name for any mineral ore containing tantalum. Most tantalum mines are open pit; some are underground. The process of mining tantalum involves blasting, crushing and transporting the resulting ore to begin the process of freeing the tantalum.
