## Quartz reef mining
Quartz reef mining is a type of gold mining in "reefs" (veins) of quartz. Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust, and most quartz veins do not carry gold, but those that have gold are avidly hunted by prospectors.  In more recent times, gold has been recovered by the cyanide process, instead of using mercury-coated

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.
