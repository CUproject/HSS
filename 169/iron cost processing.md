## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
The reduction of iron oxides takes place according to the following chemical equations: (1) F e 2 O 3 + 3 C O → 2 F e + 3 C O 2 (2) F e 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 → 2 F e + 3 H 2 O. In contrast to the blast furnace process, the direct-reduced iron process operates at temperatures of up to 1000 °C. The iron ores are therefore not melted!

## Iron Price Per Pound | Iron Scrap Metal Buyer | Scrap Gators
Today, iron prices sit in a range trending around $.04 per pound or $92 per ton. In 2012 and 2013, for example, the price of iron consistently leveled around a higher price when demand rose for iron ore. Overall though, iron is on a general upward trend since 2016—perhaps because it is used heavily in vehicles and appliances.
