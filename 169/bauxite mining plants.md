Bauxite is the main ore of aluminium and to be commercially exploited should contain more than 25-30% aluminium oxide. The main constraint is the amount of available alumina which can be extracted by the Bayer or similar process. It is named after Les Baux de Provence, in southern France; the major producers are Australia and Brazil.
