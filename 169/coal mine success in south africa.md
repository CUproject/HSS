Increasingly mines are simply abandoned, leaving a legacy of local and global pollution. Every year, South Africa's coal mines - operational and abandoned - are estimated to release greenhouse pollution equivalent to 900,000 cars. Proper rehabilitation of mines includes backfilling and sealing old shafts, halting the release of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.
