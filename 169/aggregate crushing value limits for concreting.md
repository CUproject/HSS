## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Estimate Aggregate Crushing Strength:
Aggregate Crushing Value Test on coarse totals gives a relative measure of the protection of a total squashing under bit by bit connected compressive load. Coarse total pounding esteem is the rate by weight of the squashed material got when test totals are subjected to a predetermined load under institutionalized conditions.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## Pavement materials: Aggregates - IIT Bombay
The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load. The test consists of subjecting the specimen of aggregate in standard mould to a compression test under standard load conditions (Figure 1). Dry aggregates passing through 12.5 mm sieves and retained 10 mm sieves are filled

## Aggregate Crushing Value IS: 2386 PART- 4 - Civil Engineering Calculators
Aggregate Crushing Value = W B W A × 100. Where, W A is weight of surface-dry sample; W B is weight of fraction passing the appropriate sieve; Reporting of Results. The mean of the two results shall be reported to the nearest whole number as the 'aggregate crushing value' of the size of material tested.
