## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
In this percentage 40 to 50 % proportion of aggregate is fine aggregate (sand). Fine aggregate selection plays vital role in concrete performance and its cost. Lately the need for replacing sand with alternative materials have picked governing serious environmental impact of dredging sand from river bed, also there is huge demand and supply gap

atural Sand is being used as fine aggregate in concrete making and is preferred as fine aggregate. It is mostly mined from the river beds and indiscriminate mining of sand has reportedly causing damages to the environment. We also see that dependency on this source has led to high material costs also. Now there is h igh scarcity of natural sand.

Search among different industrial by-products available in your area. Take into account the transportation costs, because such materials cost almost nothing. Suitable candidates to replace fine fraction of sand are coal fly ash, carbonate (limestone, dolomite) sand as rock waste left in quarries, which use blasting for producing coarse aggregates.
