## The Recovery Of Iron As Hematite
Recovery of iron from hazardous tailings using fluidized Hematite, magnetite, quartz and a small amount of chlorite were the major phases in the iron ore tailings. The total iron content reached 10.60%, and the chief ferrous minerals in the tailings were hematite (Fe 2 O 3), magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and carbonate (FeCO 3).

## Processing of Banded Hematite Quartzite Ore for Recovery of Iron Values 
This study investigates upgrading of low-grade banded hematite quartzite iron ore (Fe ~31%). Conventional beneficiation was found to be futile. The susceptibility of iron phases to microwave exposure and their selective absorption assists in the liberation of iron values. Microwave exposure of coarse particles at 540 W for 10 min yielded a concentrate with Fe 56.30% and recovery of 50.68%

Origins. Although Rome was founded as far back as 750 BCE, it led a precarious existence for several centuries. Initially, it was ruled by Etruscan kings who commissioned a variety of Etruscan art (murals, sculptures and metalwork) for their tombs as well as their palaces, and to celebrate their military victories.

## Iron Ores (Hematite and Magnetite) - GeeksforGeeks
Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.
