## Feasibility studies for mining projects - AMC Consultants
Feasibility studies are required throughout the pre-production stage of every mining project to justify continued investment in the subsequent phase. Usually a concept study or scoping study is followed by one or more pre-feasibility studies that reflect the increasing level of technical and economic knowledge gained at the various earlier stages.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Feasibility study and design of a new underground coal mine developed 
However, mining engineers and/or miners in Indonesia do not have a lot of experiences, expertise and know-how concerning the plans and operations of an underground coal mine. In addition, the industry faces a lot of problems which include poor conditions such as a steep coal seam, groundwater problem, stability of highwall, etc.

## Feasibility Study of Underground Coal Gasification Combined With CO2 
However, to facilitate the utilization of coals, some key barriers need to be removed. Due to the limit of current coal mining technologies, 85% of the world coal resources are considered as unmineable [3]. Coal mining introduces problems of safety, subsidence, underground water contamination, most in the form of CH4.
