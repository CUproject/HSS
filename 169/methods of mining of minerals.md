The methods of extracting minerals used in construction are limited to quarries. In fact, this is a fully mechanized work, which involves the use of bulldozers and other heavy equipment. In any case, before mining first determine the depth of occurrence, as well as the conditions and only then determined with the method.

After mining is complete, the topsoil and overburden may be used in reclamation for slopes and revegetation. Heavy minerals occur as sand grains mixed with lighter clays and quartz sand grains. Within the ore body, less than 5% of the grains may be heavy minerals. Two mining methods are used: suction dredging and auxiliary mining.

Surface Mining. Used to mine the metals and minerals present near the earth's surface, surface mining is a much more economically viable option than underground mining. The three basic types of surface mining are quarry mining, strip mining, and open pit mining. Used to obtain all minerals except coal, open pit mining involves making cuts into the ground and working the area at that depth

Mining can occur either at Earth's surface in strip mines or open pit mines, or beneath the surface in underground mines. The method used depends on the depth, lateral extent, and economic value of the rock being mined. The deepest underground mine on Earth, which is 2.4 mi (3.8 km) deep, is a South African gold mine.

May 20, 2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Open-pit Mining. Open-pit mining is a method in which an ore is removed by digging a pit in the ground, and is used to remove copper, gold, iron, as well as non-metallic minerals. It is normally used when the rock layer above the ore is too weak to allow underground tunnels. In this technique, circular steps, or 'benches', are dug around

## Mining Methods Now and in the Future - Advancing Mining
Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.
