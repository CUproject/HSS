## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The capacity of jaw crushers is limited, so they are typically used for small or medium projects up to approximately 1600 t/h. Vibrating screens are often placed ahead of the jaw crushers to remove undersize material, or scalp the feed, and thereby increase the capacity of the primary crushing operation.

Which are better, Jaw or Cone Crushers? While jaw crushers may always be a smart primary crusher stage choice for many operations, it's true that newer cone crushers are increasingly taking their place due to versatility. Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
