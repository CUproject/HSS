The A-horizon is generally considered to be fertile and well suited to agriculture. It may be subject to the processes of LEACHING or ELUVIATION in regions with relatively high rainfall. This causes the removal of some of the nutrients down through the soil profile to leave behind a nutrient-poor eluviated horizon within the main A-horizon.
