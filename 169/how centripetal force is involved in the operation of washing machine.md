## Science At Play: Centripetal Force Fun
Centripetal force is all around you. The sides of your washing machine apply a force to keep all of your clothes traveling in a circle, instead of flying across the room. The tiny holes in the drum of your washing machine rely on the principle of centripetal force to dry your clothes. Your clothes are too big to go through these holes and are

## Which force acts in the washing machine, centripetal or  - Quora
Answer (1 of 5): The answer is both. Forces go in pairs and are equal and opposite thus you must have both. A washing machine is in effect a spinning top thus when the machine rotates the centrifugal force exerted by one side of the machine is balanced by the centrifugal force exerted by the othe

## Centripetal Force Of A Washing Machine
How Is Centripetal Force Involved in the Operation. Apr 06, 2020 Centripetal force pushes objects away from the center of a circle. Just as a race car driver is propelled to the far edges of a circular track while in motion, clothing in a washing machine is pushed to the edge of the barrel because the force of motion repels the center of the machine.

## 10 Real Life Examples of Centripetal Force in Action - Separators
Apr 6, 2021Centripetal force is the force that acts on an object in order to direct it towards a center of curvature. Imagine swinging a yo-yo around in a circle. The force generated by your arm puts the yo-yo itself in motion, and the tension on the string keeps it moving in a circular path as you twirl it. That tension is centripetal force.

What Is Centrifugal Force In Washing Machine? Centrifugal force is the force that attracts water molecules towards the center of a washing machine. This force is greatest in the lower part of the washing machine where the water is being circulated. The Centrifugal force is also responsible for the power needed to wash clothes.

In the above processes, both processes use the centrifugal force and act in the same manner. so, we can say that the working principle of the washing machine is centrifugation. correct answer is optionoteody moving onircular path has two forces acting on it. one is centripetal force and the other is centrifugal force.

## Centripetal Force Facts and Concepts - Washing machine: How it works
Centripetal force is a real force that acts on an object moving in a circular path. And this force acts towards the center of the circle. This is the force that enables an object to continue its motion in a circular path. Its magnitude: Fc = mass x Centripetal Acceleration = mv2/r. where m = the mass of the object in motion, measured in kg.
