## Physical Properties - Copper
Typical physical properties of copper-nickel alloys are illustrated below. Thermal conductivity and expansion characteristics are of particular interest for heat exchangers and condensers. Low magnetic permeability is required in some applications, such as minesweepers. Although 70-30 Cu-Ni is essentially non-magnetic, 90-10 Cu-Ni has a higher

Copper(I) complexes. Forming copper(I) complexes (other than the one with water as a ligand) also stabalises the copper(I) oxidation state. For example, both [Cu(NH 3) 2] + and [CuCl 2]-are copper(I) complexes which don't disproportionate. The chlorine-containing complex is formed if copper(I) oxide is dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid.
