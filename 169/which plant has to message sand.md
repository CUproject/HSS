## Is Beach Sand Good For Plants? (Gardening Experts Comment)
Yes, but usually in moderation. Healthy soil is composed of equal (or near-equal) amounts of sand, silt, and clay. Beach sand is great to use as a soil additive, especially if you're making your own potting mix. Sand alone isn't a great idea because it has too much drainage and will not hold water or nutrients.

## Planted Aquarium Substrate: Soil, Gravel, and Sand - Buce Plant
Sand. Sand is a much finer and softer version of gravel. It is made up of tiny particles of rocks, shells, and other earthly materials. Since the granules are so tiny, sand makes the ideal substrate for bottom-feeding fish or fish with soft bellies. The extra fine particles feel much softer compared to other substrates.
