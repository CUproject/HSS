Those deposits that are preserved within 1-2 kilometers of the Earth's surface and that have a high enough concentration of metal have the potential to be economically retrieved.  Historically speaking the average depth of an exploration drill hole targeting nonferrous metallic minerals is approximately 1,100 feet with a general range

## mineral processing - Concentration | Britannica
Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill. In large-scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated. These properties can be colour (optical sorting), density (gravity separation), magnetic or electric (magnetic and electrostatic separation), and

## Metallic Deposits - CliffsNotes
Metallic Deposits. Metals occur in all kinds of rocks but usually in concentrations that are too low to be mined. Metallic ore deposits, however, are relatively rare concentrations of metal‐bearing minerals (usually sulfides) that contain enough metal to be profitably mined. Again, the profit line is dependent on a number of economic factors.

hydrothermal mineral deposit, any concentration of metallic minerals formed by the precipitation of solids from hot mineral-laden water (hydrothermal solution). The solutions are thought to arise in most cases from the action of deeply circulating water heated by magma. Other sources of heating that may be involved include energy released by radioactive decay or by faulting of the Earth's crust.
