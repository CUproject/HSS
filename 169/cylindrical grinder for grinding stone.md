## What is cylindrical grinding operation? - 3Q Machining
Cylindrical Grinding is a metalworking process that uses a rotary grinder to form a finished surface on the inside or outside of a cylindrical workpiece. Cylindrical grinding is often used on workpieces that are too long and/or heavy to be turned, but it can also be used for accurate and precise surface finishes on cylindrical components, such as shafts, axles, and gears.

## Cylindrical Grinding - Fine MetalWorking
Feb 15, 2021Cylindrical Grinding is a process where you use a grinding wheel rotating in a horizontal axis to cut or grind a cylindrical work-piece mounted on a chuck or between centers rotating in an axis parallel to the grinding wheel axis, in the same plane. Abrasive particles on the grinding wheel do the cutting of material.
