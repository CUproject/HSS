Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

Crushing is the process of size reduction of ore. Size reduction process begins with usage of explosives at the area for production of ore. In later stages, the size reduction process performed with crushers before grinding in mills is called "crushing". Although there is no limit set, the downsizing process over 3 mm is considered as "crushing
