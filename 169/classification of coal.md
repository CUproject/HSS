## Coal formation and classification - onlineexamguide
Formation of coal. Geosynclinal type: Intermediate type: Platform type: Coal formation and classification. The term "coal" is typically used to describe a sedimentary formation with a high carbonaceous content that is formed from plant matter and involves a number of processes, including burial, compaction, and biochemical transformation.

## Standards for the classification of public coal lands - USGS
In order to provide uniformity in the classification of coal lands in the public domain, certain standards have been prepared from time to time by the U.S. Geological Survey. The controlling factors are the depth, quality, and thickness of the coal beds. The first regulations were issued April 8, 1907; others followed in 1908, 1909, and 1913.

## What are the different types of coal? - American Geosciences Institute
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four

Score: 4.2/5 (55 votes) . Coal is classified according to the nature of the original vegetation, the duration of its formation and - importantly - the depths and temperatures to which it has been subjected.There are several classifications; we use the ASTM classification by rank, which is based on fixed carbon and gross calorific value.

Coals are classified into three main ranks, or types: lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite. These classifications are based on the amount of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen present in the coal. Coals other constituents include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, ash, and sulfur. Some of the undesirable chemical constituents include chlorine and sodium.

In order to provide uniformity in the classification of coal lands in the public domain, certain standards have been prepared from time to time by the U.S. Geological Survey. The controlling factors are the depth, quality, and thickness of the coal beds. The first regulations were issued April 8, 1907; others followed in 1908, 1909, and 1913.

Coal is a sedimentary rock that is blackish or brownish-black in colour and is developed from start rock also referred to as coal seams. This is assumed to have developed from the residue of the algae plants.
