## EPA1 - Method of purifying gypsum - Google Patents
The present invention relates to a method of purifying flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum. The method is characterized by comprising the steps of a) providing an aqueous slurry containing said FGD gypsum, b) passing said aqueous slurry to a magnetic separator, and c) contacting the FGD gypsum to be purified with a solution containing an acid and having pH below 5 in an acid washing step.

## What is gypsum used for in food?hcharge
What is gypsum used for in food? High purity gypsum has been widely used in the food and beverage industries for many years either as a processing aid or as a natural food additive. It can be used to stabilize and firm foods and regulate their acidity levels. It also adds calcium to food and is used as a dough conditioner.

## Gypsum - Nature's Way Resources
Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral that is made up of calcium sulfate and water (CaSO4+2H2O) that is sometimes called hydrous calcium sulfate. It is the mineral calcium sulfate with two water molecules attached. By weight it is 79% calcium sulfate and 21% water. Gypsum has 23% calcium and 18% sulfur and its solubility is 150 times that of
