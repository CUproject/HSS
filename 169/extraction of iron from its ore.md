## Iron Extraction by Blast Furnace Metallurgy - VEDANTU
Iron, when extracted from iron ore such as haematite containing iron (III) oxide, Fe2O3, in a blast furnace is called iron extraction blast furnace metallurgy. In this reduction reaction, oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally, the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures.

Mild steel. Mild steel is iron containing up to about 0.25% of carbon. The presence of the carbon makes the steel stronger and harder than pure iron. The higher the percentage of carbon, the harder the steel becomes. Mild steel is used for lots of things - nails, wire, car bodies, ship building, girders and bridges amongst others.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Step 1: The Iron ore is crushed and broken into smaller pieces, concentrated with gravity separation process (washed with water). Step 2: The raw materials are added into the top of the furnace : Iron ore (Haematite, Fe2O3), Coke (Carbon, C), Limestone (CaCO3) Step 3: It is heated by blowing hot air at the base of the blast furnace.

Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used.

However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
Feb 3, 2022How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Extraction of iron using blast furnace | Definition, Examples, Diagrams
Smelting method used in the extraction of iron. Smelting is the process in which ore is mixed with purifying or heat generating substance like limestone and coke, they are heated at high temperature in an enclosed furnace. The charge consists of roasted ore, coke and limestone in the approximate ratio of 12:5:3.

Collated: Extraction of Iron from its ore. Iron is found in many different ores, such as hematite, Fe 2 O 3, and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ).  Carbon obtained can be reused as coke for extraction of iron while oxygen gas can be safely released in to the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide is an acidic gas.
