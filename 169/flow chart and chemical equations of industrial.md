## Sedimentation Process Definition - Chemical Engineering World
September 13, 2019. Sedimentation Process Definition :- The separation of solids from a suspension during a liquid by gravity settling is termed sedimentation. The gravity force is accountable for the motion of solids through the liquid during this operation; dilute slurry is separated into a transparent liquid and slurry of upper solids content.

## What Are Chemical Equations? - ThoughtCo
This can be seen in the following equation: 2 H 2 (g) + O 2 (g) → 2 H 2 O (l) Hydrogen and oxygen are indicated by (g), which means they are gases. Water is marked (l), which means it is a liquid. Another symbol you may see is (aq), which means the chemical species is in water — or an aqueous solution. The (aq) symbol is a sort of shorthand

Mar 13, 2021Three different equations. A Generalized Approach to Balancing Equations. Assuming that you know how to balance chemical equations from basic inference and a kind of guess-and-check process, which is, for the most part, highly effective, to automate this process we need an algorithm that is generalizable.

## Chem - Types of Chemical Equations | Scientific Tutor
You want to be able to identify which one of the 5 types of chemical equations it is. To do that the best way is to ask questions about the chemical equations in front of you. Below is a picture of the flow chart of the questions and information that allow you to either confirm or deny the different types of chemical equations. Look to the
