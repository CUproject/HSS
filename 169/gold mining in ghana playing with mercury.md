## Gold Mining in Ghana: Playing with Mercury - Round Earth Media Archive
Mercury sells for about 40GH ($20) a bottle and is shipped in legally, primarily from China, to Ghana's major ports. Ghana has the highest mercury emissions in Africa, but the problem is widespread. In the past few years, tens of thousands of small-scale mining sites have surfaced across Asia, Latin America as well as other parts of Africa.

Ghana's mining law allows the use of mercury for small-scale gold mining in quantities considered "reasonably necessary." Mercury is readily available for sale in Ghana's mining towns. Shops sell it in small quantities or large — too heavy for one person to lift. Traders in neighboring countries travel there to buy it.

## Mercury-free gold mining in Ghana - Mining Magazine
The mining sector has contributed significantly to Ghana's foreign exchange earnings and revenue generation. In 2019, proceeds from the export of minerals increased to to US$6.7 billion from US$5.8 billion in 2018 according to the Bank of Ghana. Small scale mining, in particular, contributed 35% gold production in 2019.

We're on track to transforming Ghana's small scale mining sector. About 100 mercury-free mineral processing plants have been commissioned by #Ghana's President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. The technologies, spearheaded by Commodity Monitor Limited, will increase #gold recovery and prevent the use of toxic chemicals like mercury. It's a partnership with Appropriate Process Technologies (APT).
