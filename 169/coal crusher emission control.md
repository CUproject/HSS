Crushing Emission Factor is utilized as a conservative estimate because there is no Primary Crushing Emission Factor. Additionally, the use of AP-42 Chapter 11.19.2-2 Controlled Emission Factors is allowed as described in the BAPC AP-42 Chapter 11.19.2 Emission Factor Decision Tree. Finally, multipliers for PM 2.5 are based on AP-42 Chapter 13.2.4.
