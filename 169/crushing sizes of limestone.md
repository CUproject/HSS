## Crushing Products Size and Shape -What to Expect
The difference between the cumulative percentages at the 3.5″ and 1.5″ points on the curve gives us the amount, of such product to be expected from the output of the primary crusher This is 85 minus 43, or 42% of the primary crusher product. If our problem had covered a crushing condition calling for 80 instead of 85% passing the opening

## Rock Crushing Theory and Formula using Kick & Rittinger's Law
In the upper diagram the inclined line (Bedford limestone) connecting the various points shows that for different average sizes of material undergoing crushing, the production of E. U. per foot-pound-applied on 100 g. decreases from coarse to fine; according to Stadler's interpretation of Kick's law there should be no decrease, they should
