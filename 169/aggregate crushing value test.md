The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

## Aggregate Crushing value test procedure | Civil4M
The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.
