## How Is The Iron Ore Mined? - FTM Machinery
Therefore, the mining of iron ore has been controlled by several large companies. Iron ore is the main component of steel and accounts for 95% of the world's metal use each year. The world's largest single iron ore producer is the Brazilian mining company called Vale, which produces more than 350 million tons of iron ore per year.

## Understanding Iron Ores and Mining of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
The process of mining of iron ore from discovery of an iron ore deposit body through extraction of iron ores and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the iron ore deposit, which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent

## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.
