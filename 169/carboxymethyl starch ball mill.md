The TG curves of the native starch, CMS (DS cm = 0.76) and ACMS (DS cm = 0.76, DS ac = 0.34) are shown in Fig. 1(B).These curves show that both native starch and starch derivatives involve two steps of weight loss. The first slight weight loss below 100 °C can be attributed to the dryness procedure, and the subsequent second major weight loss occurring could be attributed to the decomposition

Tapioca pearls, also known as tapioca balls, are edible translucent spheres produced from tapioca, a starch made from the cassava root. They originated as a cheaper alternative to sago in Southeast Asian cuisine. When used as an ingredient in bubble tea, they are most commonly referred to as pearls or boba.The starch pearls are typically five to ten millimetres (0.2 to 0.4 inches) in diameter.

Aug 19, 2022Potato starch (PS) was triple-modified by a combination of debranching, carboxymethylation and sulfonation to improve some of its properties and enlarge its application for the various purposes. The results showed that the carboxymethylation and sulfonation were mainly completed on large particles produced by debranching.
