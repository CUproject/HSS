## Why Are Additives Used In Concrete? - Corrosion Inhibitors - News 
In the case of little impact on other properties of concrete, the use of concrete additives can greatly improve a certain performance of concrete. For example, as long as 0.2% - 0.3% calcium lignosulfonate water reducer is added into concrete, the slump of concrete can be increased by more than one time without increasing the amount of water

When the same ingredient is added to a cement during the manufacturing process, the industry calls it an additive. If this isn't confusing enough, cement engineers refer to pozzolanic materials and hydraulic material other than portland cement as mineral admixtures. The reason is mineral admixtures have a different effect on the recipe.
