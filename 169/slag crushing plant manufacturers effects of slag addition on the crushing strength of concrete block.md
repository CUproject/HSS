## effects of slag addition for the crushing strength of
A proper amount of Fe 2 O 3 or SiO 2 addition increased the crushing strength of DRI due to the softening of slag. Excessive Fe 2 O 3 or SiO 2 resulted in the melting of slag, which decreases crushing strength. effects of slag addition on the crushing strength of. effects of slag addition on the crushing strength of concrete block .
