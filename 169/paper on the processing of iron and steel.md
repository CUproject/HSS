## Microstructure and Selected Properties of Iron-Vanadium Coatings 
This paper presents the results of the microstructure, mechanical and physicochemical properties of coatings produced by the remelting of a VC pre-coat applied in the form of a paste on 145Cr6 steel. The remelting process was carried out using a diode laser beam. A laser device with a rated power of 3 kW was used. During these tests, a constant laser beam scanning speed of 3 m/min was used.

## Steel making process - ArcelorMittal
There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron. Sponge is an intermediate product, which

Water use in the iron and steel industry varied widely and depended on the availability of water, age and condition of plants and equipment, kinds of processes, and plant operating procedures. Gross water use in integrated steel plants ranged from 11,200 to 110,000 gallons per ton of steel ingots, and in steel processing plants it ranged from

## Microstructure and Selected Properties of Iron&ndash;Vanadium Coatings 
This paper presents the results of the microstructure, mechanical and physicochemical properties of coatings produced by the remelting of a VC pre-coat applied in the form of a paste on 145Cr6 steel. The remelting process was carried out using a diode laser beam. A laser device with a rated power of 3 kW was used. During these tests, a constant laser beam scanning speed of 3 m/min was used

## Low-Carbon Production of Iron & Steel: Technology Options, Economic 
Mar 8, 2021A globally traded commodity, iron and steel production has tripled production since 2000, with 2018 seeing $2.5 trillion in sales [(Worldsteel Association, 2019)]. It is also an enormous source of greenhouse gases: today's iron and steel industry generates roughly 6% of global CO2 emissions (see table 2).

## Iron and Steel | Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Iron and steel are key products for the global economy. Since 2000, global steel production has grown by 75%, reaching 1.49 billion tons of steel in 2011. 1 The sector is the largest industrial emitter of CO 2 (with direct emissions of 2.16 Gt in 2006) and second largest industrial user of energy (consuming 24 EJ in 2006). Although considerable improvements have been made in recent years, the
