## Gyratory Crushers - Sandrock Mining
Sandrock Mining Gyratory crushers are frequently used in the primary crushing stage and a little less often in the secondary stage. Gyratory crushers have an oscillating shaft. The material is reduced in a crushing cavity, between an external fixed element (bowl liner) and an internal moving element (mantle) mounted on the oscillating shaft

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment).. This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. - As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
