## Grinding capacity is influenced by the size of balls
May 13, 2022Ball size distribution is governed by the wear law of the mill and by the wear characteristics through the cross-section of the balls charged to the mill. With this in mind, it is interesting to make a qualitative comparison of the ball size distributions which should be generated by 76 mm pearlitic carbon steel balls versus 76 mm martensitic

## Ball Mill | Baking Processes | BAKERpedia
What is a ball mill? A ball mill is a size reduction or milling equipment which uses two grinding mechanisms, namely, impact and shear. 1 Unlike other size reduction equipment, such as breakers and jaw crushers, ball mills are capable of producing powders and particulate materials of mean particle sizes within the 750 to 50 micron (µm) range.

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.
