Dec 25, 2021Hundreds of quarries have operated in the Apuan Alps since the days of ancient Rome. These quarries are far off of Italy's most-traveled tourist routes, so few visitors see them; most of us know Italian marble mainly as an endpoint in the chain of consumption. The quarries themselves, are their own isolated world: beautiful, bizarre and severe.

Part of the great archeological park, this ancient quarry and Greek era prison is scary. A cleft carved 180 feet into basalt and maybe 80 feet tall in places, its shaft curves into the solid rock in which there is no illumination. To enter one goes through going blind as the light quickly fails and tiny lights have no impact on the hole.

According to the new study, the bluestone outcrops are formed of natural, vertical pillars. These could be eased off the rock face by opening up the vertical joints between each pillar.

Some time ago, Bernhard Lang used aerial photography to photograph the famous Carrara marble quarry in Italy. Marble has played an important role in the construction industry since ancient times, but now humans have over-exploited marble to destroy the natural ecology. Today we must think about the natural recovery after mining marble.
