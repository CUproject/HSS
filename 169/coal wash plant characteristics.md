## Coal Washing | Encyclopedia
Coal washing Coal that comes from a mine is a complex mixture of materials with a large variety of physical properties. In addition to the coal itself, pieces of rock, sand, and various minerals are contained in the mixture. Thus, before coal can be sold to consumers, it must be cleaned. The cleaning process consists of a number of steps that results in a product that is specifically suited to

## Characteristics of Coal | Fossil Consulting Services, Inc.
There are four different types of coal: Anthracite - contains between 86% and 98% carbon by weight and it burns in boilers slowly. Bituminous - contains between 69% & 86% carbon by weight. Sub-bituminous - contains less carbon, more water and is a less efficient source of heat for boilers. Lignite - contains up to 70% water by weight.

Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

## coal - Structure and properties of coal | Britannica
The plant material from which coal is derived is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds, including cellulose, lignin, fats, waxes, and tannins. As peat formation and coalification proceed, these compounds, which have more or less open structures, are broken down, and new compounds—primarily aromatic (benzenelike) and hydroaromatic—are produced. In vitrinite these compounds are
