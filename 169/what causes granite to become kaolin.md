## The Essential of Kaolin in Paint and Coatings Industry - GMCI
Kaolin Clay is a hydrated silicate aluminium crystalline material, which is produced over millions of years by the hydrothermal decomposition of granite minerals, or 'china clay,' as it is widely called. It is a soft, earthy, usually white mineral which in many parts of the world is colored pink-orange-red by iron oxide. Sometimes, alternating layers are found.
