## What is the Beneficiation Process of Fluorite Ore - GeologyHere
May 3, 2021The beneficiation of metallurgical grade fluorite concentrate only needs to be hand-selected and gravity beneficiation is enough.  Fluorite ore is an important mineral resource and plays a very important role in metallurgy, chemical, and other industries. As a mineral resource, fluorite ore can be used directly without treatment.

## The Overview of Ore Beneficiation Process_ITPUB
The ultimate purpose and mission of the ore beneficiation is to separate the useful minerals from the useless gangue minerals, as much as possible making the useful minerals separated and richly integrated into concentrates, comprehensively recovering the valuable elements, excluding harmful metallurgical and other processing impurities and improving the quality of mineral products, in order
