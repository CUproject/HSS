## Iron Ore Pelletization - FEECO International Inc.
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized - a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

Hematite and magnetite are the most prominent iron ores. Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores (direct shipping ore (DSO)) are subjected to simple dry processes of beneficiation to meet size requirements. This involves multistage crushing and screening to obtain lump (− 31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately − 6.3 mm) products.

## Iron Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Iron ore minerals, particularly hematite and goethite, are beneficiated by a combination of size fraction, preconcentration, and flotation in stages (Fig. 13.45).Iron ore requires removal of silicate impurities of a finer size by flotation for higher-grade products of +60% Fe. ROM ore at mm is fed to a primary crusher with product set at -40 mm.

Crushing. As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace, however, requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres, so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size. Crushed ore is divided into various fractions
