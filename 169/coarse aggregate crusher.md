## Aggregate Crushers - High-efficiency And Eco-friendly
Aggregate crushers can crush and process construction waste into concrete sand and gravel aggregates that meet production requirements. Recycled sand and gravel aggregates have similar properties to natural sand and gravel, which can be sued to configure concrete or mortar or be used as raw materials for the production of bricks.

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Feb 19, 2022Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed. It is possible to crush stones of various sizes together in the machines. But in the case of hand-crushing, only similar-sized stones are used. Coarse aggregates are mixed in particular proportions to obtain high-quality concrete.

While they perform a slight amount of scrubbing, coarse washers are primarily designed to remove unwanted material from a feed. For example, they'll separate out (-4) mesh in gravel from the crushing circuit. That smaller material floats out the back end while the desired mix is carried up the slope. A series of paddles cause light scrubbing

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

Experimental determination of toughness of coarse aggregates. The toughness of coarse aggregates can be evaluated by 'Aggregate Impact Value Test'. This test consists of subjecting an aggregate sample with an impact load. This is unlike the aggregate crushing value test in which the sample is gradually loaded. Standard Followed: BS 812
