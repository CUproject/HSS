## Dolomite Lime pH Stabilizer: Reduce Soil Acidity Easily
Well, Dolomite lime is added to raise the pH between 5.5 to 6.5 which is ideal for plants. Generally, it takes 4 tablespoons of lime for 1 square foot. This dose increases the soil pH by two points. So, if the pH of the soil was 5, by adding four tablespoons, it can increase to 7. Add dolomite to Neutralize acidity.

## Dolomite - a very useful mineral - Serina Trading
Dolomite has a different role in ceramics. The magnesium carbonate in the dolomite is an important fluxing agent at higher temperatures. At lower temperatures, dolomite can act as a matting agent. The iron and titanium impurities in the dolomite need to be low for ceramic applications to avoid off-white firing problems.

## How To Use Dolomite Lime For Plants
Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

2. APPLICATIONS Dolomite is used for a variety of purposes as it is a versatile rock. It is mainly used in the construction industry and is often used as a substitute for limestone. Industrial uses of dolomite include the manufacturing of glass (the glass manufacturing industryuses pre-calcined dolomite, which theoretically contains about 21.8% magnesium oxide, or MgO).
