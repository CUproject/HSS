## Phosphate Rock Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases
The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.

Phosphate rock mining originally started in South Carolina 1867 for manufacturing of phosphate fertilizers (Van Kauwenbergh 2010). In the early 20th century, new complex fertilizers were created that contained phosphoric acid, as well as ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride, commonly called NPK fertilizers (UNEP/UNIDO 2000).

##  How phosphate is mined and processed
rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants. The solubility also depends on rock type and the pH of the soil; phosphorus is most soluble when contained in sedimentary rocks as opposed to igneous rock, and when soil pH is between 5.5 and 7.2.

Mechanized open-cut mining is used to first strip off the overburden and then to excavate in strips the exposed phosphate rock bed matrix. In the Rusaifa area of Jordan, the stripping ratio of overburden to phosphate rock is about 7:1 by wt. [28].

## What is phosphorite mineral? Explained by FAQ Blog
Why is phosphate mining good? But we can provide more by mining phosphate rock and turning it into fertilizer to spread on the land. It takes one ton of phosphate to produce every 130 tons of grain, which is why the world mines about 170 million tons of phosphate rock every year to ship around the world and keep soils fertile.

Phosphate rock (or Phosphorite) basically refers to any form of rock that possesses a high phosphorous content. Often extracted by means of surface drilling, this rock is mined through a blasting and harvesting process. Its uses are quite varied. Frequently it is utilized to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements, and more regularly it

Mining first began in the United States in 1867 in South Carolina. Phosphate rock was discovered in central Florida in the 1880s, and because of the extensive, high-quality deposits and lower mining cost, it quickly became the leading phosphate-producing state. Currently, phosphate rock is mined in Florida, Idaho, North Carolina and Utah.

phosphorite, also called phosphate rock, rock with a high concentration of phosphates in nodular or compact masses. The phosphates may be derived from a variety of sources, including marine invertebrates that secrete shells of calcium phosphate, and the bones and excrement of vertebrates. The thickest deposits of phosphorite form in areas characterized by carbonaceous shale and chert.

## Phosphate Rock
Phosphate Rock is an excellent natural source of phosphorus, calcium and many essential trace elements.
