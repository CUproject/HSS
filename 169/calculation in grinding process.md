## Common & Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing Calculations
Pulp Densities. Pulp densities indicate by means of a tabulation the percentages of solids (or liquid-to-solid ratio) in a sample of pulp. This figure is valuable in two ways—directly, because for each unit process and operation in milling the optimum pulp density must be established and maintained, and indirectly, because certain important tonnage calculations are based on pulp density.

## The Basics of Gear Grinding - True Gear
Gear grinding is basically the process of creating the teeth or splines on a gear. There are two processes utilized and each has its own costs and benefits. After formation of the gear splines, more refined gear grinding is done to polish and finish the gear's surface. Once completed, the gear is ready for action.

Grinding Force Ratio. Grinding force ratio is a parameter that gives indirect information about the efficiency of grinding. Force ratio is defined as: (2.8) When grinding with sharp wheels grinding force ratio is high since normal force is low compared to tangential force. Conversely, when grinding with blunt wheels grinding force ratio is low.

## Grinding Process Analysis based on Material Removal Rate
A higher MRR means more efficient operation and often reduced cycle time. In theory, the definition of MRR is quite simple - the volume of material removed during the manufacturing process divided by time gives a volume/second rate mm 3 /s. Q = dVr / dt. A complex cutting tool is exceptionally complicated, geometrically; the task of estimating
