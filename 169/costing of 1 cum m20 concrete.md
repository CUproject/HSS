## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Aggregate required for 1  - Happho
For calculation, We consider a nominal concrete mix proportion of 1:2:4 (~M20). Step-1: Calculate Weights of Materials Required.  No. of bags required for 01 cum of concrete = 1/0.167 = 5.98 bags ~ 6 bags. From above, if the concrete mix is 1:2:4, to get a cubic meter of concrete we require.

M15 concrete grade concrete gets categorized as an ordinary grade. Its features, properties, and uses are quite close to M10 with a very slight difference.. PROPERTIES OF THE M15 GRADE CONCRETE: It contains a mix ratio is 1:3:6.1 cement .3 sand and six aggregate.M-15 M represents the mix, while 15 N/mm2 is the concrete cube's characteristic compressive strength for 29 days.

## Different Grade of Concrete: M20, M25, M30, their Mix ratio and Uses.
Uses of Different Grades of Concrete. 1. Ordinary Grade: M5, M10, and M15 grades of concrete are mostly used in Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) works as bed concrete below column footing. While M20 grade concrete is used for RCC works (for mild exposure) such as the construction of slabs, beams, columns, footings, etc. 2.

## Definition of M20 grade of concrete - Construction Cost
In M20, M denotes Mix and 20 refers to the characteristic strength (fck) of that mix i.e. 20mpa. Cement, sand and aggregates are used for mixing in the ratio of 1 : 1.5 : 3. M20 signifies mixture of cement, sand and aggregate which are prepared in such a manner that a cement concrete cube of size 15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm is formed with
