Electroforming is a process of making a replica of objects using electrolysis. The object to be replicated is pressed in wax to make a mould. Graphite powder is, coated uniformly to make it conducting. This is, used as a cathode and the salt of the metal to be deposited is taken as the electrolyte.

## Electrolytic processes for gold and other precious metals
Electrolytic Methods Used in Refining Processes of Gold and Other Precious Metals. Electrolysis is an electro-chemical process where an electrical current stream is flowing between two electrodes and through an electrolyte.This process involves the transfer of metal ions through the ionised electrolyte solution, depositing positive ions on the cathode and negative ions on the anode.

When the amount of gold is the same, the economic value it provides is higher. Gold is produced from jewelery scrap with a purity of 99.99 by refining. 99.999 purity can be reached with gold electrolysis after refining. According to the process to be applied afterwards, gold or silver can be poured as granules or made bars with gold melting.
