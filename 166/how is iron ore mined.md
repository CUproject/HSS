## Minnesota Iron - Iron Mining History
Minnesota has the largest deposits of iron ore in the United States, and northern Minnesota has been mining iron ore for 130 years (26 years after Minnesota became a state in 1858). The majority of iron mined is used to make steel which has been used to build infrastructure, appliances, vehicles, and so many other things that make our modern

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.
