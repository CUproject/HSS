## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
The double roll crusher is the most common rock stone crushing machine. Its crushing ratio is usually lower than in other crushers, so it's suitable for fine crushing. The roll crusher uses compression to crush materials, and the reduction ratio is 2 to 2.5 so roller crushers are not recommended for abrasive materials.
