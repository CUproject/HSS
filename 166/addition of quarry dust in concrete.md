## What are the advantages and disadvantages of stone dust in concrete 
Answer (1 of 6): Stone dust - if you are talking about the finer particles than 150 micron - it is not recommended to use in concrete. Almost everywhere, concrete is done using crush stone sand. Cement is normally passing through 90 micron. Dust have particles finer than 90 micron. Some have

This paper describes the experimental study of High-Performance concrete with quarry dust as fine aggregate in addition of steel fibre. To over-come the difficulties due to excessive sand mining, quarry dust was used as fine aggregate. Quarry dust is the fine material, produced from gravel crushers. Super plasticizers were used to improve workability of concrete. Cement was replaced with 10%

## Crushed stone size chartena
How big is a yard of crushed stone? A yard is equal to 3 feet. So a 1 cubic yard is 3 × 3 × 3 feet or 27 cubic feet. One cubic yard of crushed stone or gravel weighs around 1.5 US tons, which can fill a volume of 3 cubic feet.

## Replacement Of Sand With Quarry Dust In Concrete Production
The project is about replacing sand in concrete production with quarry dust at varying percentage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to check if the strength matches that of grade MIS with a mix ratio of I :2:4 and also the proportion which has the highest strength. The test carried out includes particle size analysis, slump test, and compressive test.

## Quarry dust - ScienceDirect
Jan 1, 2022The water absorption of quarry dust is comparatively higher than river sand due to the higher fines content (particle sizes <75 µm). 2) The inclusion of quarry dust as river sand replacement material tends to increase the water reducer's dosage and water demand of the concrete to achieve the targeted workability.

## Quarry fines: an ideal material for the manufacture of foamed concrete 
Oct 8, 2020It is obvious that, there is a maximum increment of 108% in compressive strength with the addition of quarry fines of 60% by weight of manufactured sand. The reason for this trend may be attributed to the presence of finer particles of quarry dust, which results in a denser concrete mix leading to increase in strength.

## Characteristic studies on the mechanical properties of quarry dust 
was studied with various proportions of quarry dust (CM 1:3, CM 1:2, and CM 1:1). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust for a fine to coarse aggregate ratio of 0.6 was found to enhance the compressive properties as well as elastic modulus. Key words: Concrete, quarry dust, fillers, elastic modulus, compressive strength.
