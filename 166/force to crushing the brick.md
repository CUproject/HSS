## Strength of Brick Masonry
The strength of a single brick masonry unit varies widely, depending on its ingredients and manu- facturing method. Brick can have an ultimate compressive strength as low as 1,600 psi. On the other hand, some well-burned brick has compressive strength exceeding 15,000 psi. Because portland-cement-lime mortar is normally stronger than the brick

## Compression Test on Brick ( Crushing Strength Test) | Lab Procedure
The compression strength of the brick is the ratio of maximum load at the failure to the cross-sectional area of the brick. Mathematically, Co=P/A. Where, Co = Compressive Strength of Brick. P = Maximum Load at Failure. A = Cross-sectional Area of Brick. The crushing or compressive strength of normal building bricks should not be below 3.5 N/mmÂ².

The absorption capacity is less than 10%, crushing strength is, 280kg/cm 2 (mean) where it is 245 kg/cm 2 (minimum). It doesn't have efflorescence. It emits a metallic sound when struck by another similar brick or struck by a hammer. It is hard enough to resist any fingernail expression on the brick surface if one tries to do with a thumbnail.

## Applied forces of crushing process - MEKA
The ore is crushed and taken through ploughing force which is formed by effects of crashing and shear forces. Crushers working with shear force are used when the ores are fragile, contain low silica, and a larger size product is intended as a result of crushing. Shear force is usually applied together with crashing and compression forces.

## Crusher
In industry, crushers are machines which use a metal surface to break or compress materials into small fractional chunks or denser masses. Throughout most of industrial history, the greater part of crushing and mining part of the process occurred under muscle power as the application of force concentrated in the tip of the miners pick or sledge hammer driven drill bit.

## Ask an Expert: how much weight is needed to break concrete block
1. Concrete is extremely strong in compression mode. If a block of concrete is just sitting on the ground and you try to crush it by putting weights on top, it can withstand tremendous forces. This is why we build skyscrapers out of concrete, or partly why. 2. Concrete is much weaker in "shear" mode.
