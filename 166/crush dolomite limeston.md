## Crushing of Dolomitic Limestone Boulders
What's the ideal method in crushing dolomitic limestone in boulders to +30 mesh size. You may need the horizon impact crusher to crush the rock at first. The material from the crusher feed to the screen. The below 50 mm material from the screen can be feed to a Vertical impact crusher, which can produce the +30 mesh size.
