The main raw material used to make glass is sand. To make clear glass, a special sand called silica sand is used. This fine white sand is needed because it is very pure and does not contain other unwanted chemicals. It is "washed" to remove as many impurities as possible, as impurities can adversely affect the clarity and color of the glass.
