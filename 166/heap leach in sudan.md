## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the

2.1 Leaching. Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.

## Sorting through the heap - Canadian Mining Journal
Sep 1, 2020One of the advantages of heap leaching versus conventional milling and using either carbon-in-pulp (CIP) or carbon-in-leach (CIL) for gold recovery is the lower cost. However, along with that lower cost comes a lower recovery rate. Gold recovery is also usually only about 55% to 75% compared with roughly 90% recovery in an agitated leach plant.

 Agricola, in his book De Re Metallica (publ. 1557) illustrates a heap leach with a 40-day leach cycle (Figure 1), which could pass in many ways for a modern heap leach. The Agricola heap leach recovered aluminum (actually alum) for use in the cloth dying industry. Copper heap and dump leaches in southern Spain were common by about 1700.

## Uranium Heap Leaching | nuclear-power
Heap leaching is an extraction process from ore mined and placed in piles on the surface. Heap leaching is based on using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. In 2012, the percentage of the mined uranium produced by heap leaching was 1.7 percent.

## Heap leach pads lined with HDPE : Engineered Linings (Pty) Ltd. - EngNet
Engineered Linings was contracted through AMS (African Mining Services) to line Phase 2 of the Goldfields Ghana Heap Leach Project in Tarkwa. This involved the installation of 390 000m² of 1,5 mm thick HDPE liner to 6 pads, separated by divider berms. A leaching solution of sodium cyanide is sprayed on the 8 - 10m high lifts of crushed gold
