The diameter of the central hole in the grinding disc (3) must fit the inner flange (10) without any play. Do not use any adapters or reducers. Use clamps or other practical way to secure and support the workpiece to a stable platform. Holing the work by hand or against your body is unstable and may lead to loss of control. Do not force tool.
