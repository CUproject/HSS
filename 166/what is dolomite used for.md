Aug 16, 2021Dolomite limestone is best used to change the acidity, or pH, of the soil. Start with a soil pH test, which you can buy at garden centers, to determine the existing pH. Most plants do best with a pH of 6.0 to 7.4. If your soil registers with a pH of 5.9 or below, dolomitic lime can help raise the pH to make the soil more plant-friendly.

Dolomite, or dolostone, is a carbonate sedimentary rock made mostly from the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO3)2. It commonly occurs in association with limestone and shares many of the same properties, but reacts only weakly with acid. Dolomite often has a sugary texture and is typically off-white to gray in color.
