## Top 9 Effects of Mining on the Environment
Jul 2, 20223. Water Quantity. One of the most overlooked effects of mining on the environment is depletion in water quantity. Surface and groundwater resources may be depleted by mining. Even kilometers away from the actual mine site, groundwater withdrawals can harm or destroy streamside ecology.

## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
Mining Contributes To Global Warming. Natural resources extracted through mining contribute heavily to global warming. Coal and oil are burned to power cars and our electric grid, releasing dangerous CO2 into the environment. Beyond being fueling these processes, mining itself creates a lot of pollution.
