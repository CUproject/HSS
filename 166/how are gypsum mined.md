## Mined Gypsum - Walt's Organic Fertilizer Co.
Mined Gypsum. $ 5.10 - $ 16.65. Gypsum (also called land plaster) is a natural mineral source of sulfur and calcium. Additionally, it binds with clay particles to improve drainage and so mechanically improves the soil structure. By improving the soil structure, you maximize the benefits of watering and fertilizing.
