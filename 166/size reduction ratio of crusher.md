The closed side setting determines what the final size of the particles will be and that setting can be adjusted until you've reached the desired material size. Usually, these crushers deliver a 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 reduction ratio. As you reduce the closed side setting to produce smaller material, you also reduce the capacity of the machine.

For example, coarse crushers have size reduction ratios of below 8:1, while fine grinders may present ratios as high as 100:1. However, large reduction ratios, such as those obtained when dividing relatively large solid lumps to ultra-fine powders, are normally attained by several stages using diverse crushing and grinding machines.

Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.

## Jaw Crushers - Size Reduction - Beyond Discovery
Dec 18, 2020The reduction ratios at minimum recommended settings and with straight jaw plates average about 8:1. Curved (or concave) jaw plates are designed to minimize choking.  Comparison of Crushers The jaw crusher can accommodate the same size rocks as a gyratory, with lower capacity and also lower capital and maintenance costs, but similar
