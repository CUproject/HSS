## Material Recycling System | Crush Material to Reuse as Filler
The Hog Crusher handles brick, block, stone, asphalt and non-reinforced concrete. Crushed stone and packed dirt can be reused as filler to help supplement gravel walkways and more. This capability is extra helpful in muddy or remote job sites. The Hog Crusher can save the average contracting team up to 75% of funds typically spent on dumpsters.

waste rock dumps were typically constructed to a height of about 36 m by end-dumping over the crest of the dump. The waste rock types were selectively placed, based on their identified geology and inferred acid rock drainage potential. The final surface waste rock dump footprint covered about 340 ha and the dumps contain about 120 Mt of waste rock.

The body of a crustacean is composed of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the pereon or thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be fused together to form a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow.
