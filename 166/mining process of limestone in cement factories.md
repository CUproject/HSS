Extraction and processing. Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining. It is the easiest way to remove the limestone without causing much destruction. In surface mining or open pit mining, the top soil and the overburden covering the mineral is removed. Then by the process of drilling the rocks or
