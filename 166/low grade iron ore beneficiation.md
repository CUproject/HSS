Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.

## Beneficiation of Clay-Rich High-LOI Low-Grade Iron Ore Fines 
Jun 4, 2022The unutilized iron ore fines (IOF, − 10 mm, 45% to < 60% Fe(T)) left at various mine sites during blasting and processing are rich in goethetic-hematite associated with high clay and considered a potential iron ore resource. The variation of loss on ignition (LOI) from mines to mines is based on the goethite and clay mineral content. The clay containing below 45 μm is mostly brittle

## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

## benificiation process of very low iron ore
Iron Ore Beneficiation Process. During the last ten years great strides have been made, on the Mesabi range, in the practice of beneficiating low grade iron ore material By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being silica and moisture
