## Aggregate Size In Concrete | Coarse Vs Fine Aggregate - Union Quarries
Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.

## Why do we use multi-size aggregates in concrete mix design?
Answer (1 of 7): Packing density of single size aggregates is relatively low than multi- size aggregates. Packing density is the volume of solids in unit bulk volume. Multi- sized aggregates have higher packing density. Thus to have higher packing density aggregate of different sizes are used.

## Classification of Aggregates: Grain Size, Density, Shape, Origin
Classification of aggregates based on: Grain Size. If you separate aggregates by size, there are two overriding categories: The size of fine aggregates is defined as 4.75mm or smaller. That is, aggregates which can be passed through a number 4 sieve, with a mesh size of 4.75mm. Fine aggregates include things such as sand, silt and clay.

## Classification of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape -Coarse and Fine
Aggregates are available in nature in different sizes. The size of aggregate used may be related to the mix proportions, type of work etc. the size distribution of aggregates is called grading of aggregates. Following are the classification of aggregates based on size: Aggregates are classified into 2 types according to size. Fine aggregate

Based on the grain size, the aggregates are classified into two types. Fine Aggregate. Coarse Aggregate. The fine aggregates are used in concrete as a filler material to fill the voids. The coarse aggregates are used in concrete to develop the strength of the element. The difference between the fine & coarse aggregate are listed below.
