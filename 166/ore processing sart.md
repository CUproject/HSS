## The impact of short-term variability of deposits for iron ore processing
At Iron Ore 2017, a common concern across the industry was managing the short-term variability of ore characteristics within deposits in iron ore processing, the flow-on effects of unplanned processing issues, and the resulting downtime across the production cycle. Unlike long-term trends, these incidents are less predictable and require swift

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.

Ore processing was a mining procedure in which raw minerals were extracted and processed into useful components. The Cardassian mining station Terok Nor was used to process raw uridium ore from Bajor during their Occupation. Using Bajoran slave labor, the station was able to process up to 20,000 tons of ore a day. Since the Cardassians left Bajor and Terok Nor in 2369, the ore processing

## Omnifactory Ore Processing : r/feedthebeast - reddit
It seems like I could spend days just browsing ore processing chains For now at least, though, what I'd like to do is get the basic chain above set up, with a "side chain" processing the stone dust into oxygen. As long as I can get the item routing problem I mentioned above sorted out, that seems like a good start.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Two-Stage SART Process: A Feasible  - MDPI
The SART (sulfidization, acidification, recycling, and thickening) process (SP) has been successfully implemented in gold cyanidation plants to address issues associated with high cyanide-soluble copper content ores. However, this process could produce a relatively low grade precipitate, decreasing the sale price when gold plants have high zinc and copper content in their solutions.
