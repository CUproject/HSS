Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

The most common types of rock processed into crushed stone include limestone, dolomite, granite, and traprock. Smaller amounts of marble, slate, sandstone, quartzite, and volcanic cinder are also used as construction aggregates.

## Using Volcanic Rock Dust in Your Garden | Organic Soil & Compost
The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.

## Volcanic Rock for Garden: The Pros and Cons of Lava Rock as Mulch
Apr 23, 2021You can opt for rocks ranging from 2 to 4 inches for mulch around trees and shrubs. For the area around plants and flower beds, use rocks 1 to 2 inches in size. Lay out the mulch at a 2 feet distance from all plants. You can pile it close to trees and shrubs, but the jagged edges of volcanic rock can pierce through plants as they are more delicate.
