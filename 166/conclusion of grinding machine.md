## Conclusion | Engineering360 - GlobalSpec
Conclusion. As you can see, there are various approaches to running jobs and setting cuts. Ideally, machinists strive for the most aggressive cut they can get away without quickly ruining cutters or trashing setups. Often, the limiting factor in terms of aggressive cutting turns out to be the rigidity of the setup and the strength of the cutter.
