## Characterization of chalcopyrite ore under high voltage  - ScienceDirect
Jun 30, 2022From the 1970s, researchers unanimously recognized that the unit energy consumption of crushing operation was much lower than that of grinding operation. According to statistics, the energy consumption of grinding is about 10 times that of crushing [Morrell, 2004a, Morrell, 2004b, Morrell, 2008, Morrell, 2009].

Fine grinding, to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm, is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes. This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding, it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget. Overall energy use and media

Grinding energy efficiency depends on the appropriate selection of cutting conditions, grinding wheel, and workpiece material. Additionally, the estimation of specific energy consumption is a good indicator to control the consumed energy during the grinding process. Consequently, this study develops a model of material-removal rate to estimate specific energy consumption based on the
