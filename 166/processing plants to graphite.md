I would think that you are not too worried about maximising the size of the graphite particles so gentle attrition is the way forward. You need to have a way to physically separate the clay from the graphite before attempting the separation, which would probably consist of classification (depending how fine the graphite has become) then flotation in the presence of dispersant at low percent

Graphite mineral processing are mainly suitable for all kinds of graphite with different crystal habit and graphite accompany with mica, etc silicate minerals or pyrite. Beneficiation method: flotation, electrostatic separation, gravity separation, etc

## Graphite Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.
