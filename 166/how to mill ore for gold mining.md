Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular, consists essentially of three stages, often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection, the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

Feb 11, 2022The percolation cyanidation method is also one of the cyanide leaching processes. Its principle is that the cyanide solution penetrates through the ore layer to leach the gold from the gold-bearing ore. It is suitable for alluvial and loose porous materials. There are two kinds of percolation cyanidation methods: pool leaching and heap leaching.

The stoping method may affect the percentage of ore minerals recovered in the ore-dressing plant, especially where certain sulfide ores are concentrated by flotation. Thus, a stoping method that permits immediate removal of the ore after it is broken so as to preclude its partial oxidation before it goes to the mill may be desirable or necessary.
