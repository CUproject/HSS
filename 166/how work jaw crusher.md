## jaw crusher how to make
The jaw crusher has relatively high vibration intensity during work. When selecting grease, it is necessary to select grease with high viscosity, good adhesion and good shock absorption performance. This will not affect the use time and use effect of the grease due to the strong vibration force of the jaw crusher.

## Everything about jaw crushers - what are they and how do they work 
In simple words, a jaw crusher is a hefty piece of equipment which is used to crush rocks. Jaw Crushers are primarily used in the mining and ore processing plants where the workers need to crush massive rocks. The origin of jaw crushers goes back to 1858 when inventor Eli Whitey Black first introduced this piece of machinery.
