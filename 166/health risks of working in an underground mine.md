The top five risks to a worker in the mining industry are: 1. Lung Damage. If proper protective gear is not used correctly, countless particulates and dust particles can enter a mine worker's lungs, causing major health issues like black lung, lung cancer, and chronic bronchitis. While the number of black lung cases has drastically decreased

## health risks of working in an underground mine
: To improve health and safety, the underground mining sector needs a clear understanding of the risks associated with working underground. This understanding is best achieved through a consistent, ongoing risk assessment process. Regular risk assessments help focus attention on the hazards that pose the greatest risk to health and safety.

The product of uranium mining is normally uranium oxide concentrate - U 3 O 8 - which is shipped from the mines in 200-litre drums. This is barely radioactive, but has chemical toxicity similar to lead, so occupational precautions are taken similar to those in a lead smelter. Most of the radioactivity from the ore ends up in the tailings.

## Mine fires and spontaneous-combustion control - CSIRO
Mining; Mine safety and health; Mine fires and spontaneous-combustion control. The risk of fires and explosions is a major safety concern in underground coal mines, with catastrophic consequences if robust monitoring and control measures are not in place to deal with this complex hazard.

## Underground Mining Safety - eSafety First Canada
The risks most commonly associated with underground mining include: Exposure to Asbestos and Hydrogen Sulfide. Found especially in talc and vermiculite, asbestos is an insidious substance whose effects on human health become apparent after years of exposure. Hydrogen sulfide, on the other hand, is a potentially deadly gas with an immediate impact.
