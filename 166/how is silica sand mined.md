## Stop Silica Sand Mining in MB - Manitoba Energy Justice Coalition
Silica sand mining is the process of mining to extract silica sands to be used for glass, solar panels and fracking. Very little of Manitoba's silica sand is of a pure enough quality for glass and solar panels. Cleaning sand to reach that quality is a very polluting process as it creates acid drainage.

## Is Silica Bad for the Environment? - Our Endangered World
Jan 28, 2022How is silica mined or harvested? It is commonly harvested from mines. Although Silica is also extracted from sand and quarries through mining tunnels. In order to be used in many industries, it has to undergo a purifying process. The silica needs to become soluble in water for it to be useful.

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

## Proposed silica sand mine causes concern in Ste. Genevieve Co.
May 16, 2022GENEVIEVE - A proposal to open a surface mine to remove silica sand from a 249-acre site along Highway 32 in Ste. Genevieve is giving residents of the area a great deal of concern. (See letter to the editor concerning health effects of silica sand.) The proposed location is across Highway 32 from Miller Switch and Hawn State Park Road.

Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
