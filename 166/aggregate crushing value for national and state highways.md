## Aggregate Crushing Value - CivilArc
The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load. When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place.

## Aggregate Crushing Value - Significance & Test Procedure
The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

Aggregate crushing value showed about 15.05 while aggregate abrasion value was found 37.2. The artificial aggregate properties were compared to the natural aggregates of stone chips and first class brick chips, by which it was clear that the artificial aggregate which was produced from industrial waste of rice husk ash was lightweight.
