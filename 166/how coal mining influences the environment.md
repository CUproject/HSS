## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways. Additionally, coal processing has a negative effect on human health.
