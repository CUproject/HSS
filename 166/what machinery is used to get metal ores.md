## Methods to Separate Metal From Ore - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Sep 26, 2021Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.

## Renewable ways of getting metal ores? :: Oxygen Not Included General 
Specifically for ores there are no easy ways. -As already mentioned - meteors for gold amalgam and copper ore. -Different planets. Things like copper ore are easy, wolframite, for example, is not guaranteed and hard to get. -Steel can be manufactured from renewable components and can replace ores for construction. -Rust.
