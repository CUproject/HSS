## What Is the Use and Working Principle of Jaw Crusher?
The working principle of jaw crusher is very simple. The whole crushing process rely on the relative motion of the two jaw plates. One of the jaw plates stay still while the other move against it. And with the movement, the materials between the two plates would be crushed into small elements. While the plates move against each other, the

## Crusher
The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers. In the single toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design
