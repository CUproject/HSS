Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
