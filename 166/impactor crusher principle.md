## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

## principle of operation of an impactor crusher in ramallah
The impactor family consists of two main types of impact crushers. The conventional type has horizontal shaft configuration, known as HSI. The other type consists of a centrifugal crusher with vertical shaft, generally known as VSI. Impactor operation is based on the principle of rapid transfer of impact energy to the rock material.

## C Series Impact Crusher-MECRU
Work Principle. The impact crusher uses impact energy to crush materials. When working, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at a high speed. When the material enters the action area of the hammer, it strikes and breaks with the hammer on the rotor, and then is thrown to the counterattack device to be broken again.

Rotor speeds vary from 300 to 900 RPM depending on the model of the machine and gradation requirements. Due to the true impact principle, 3-Stage impact mechanism and slow rotor speed, it is possible to operate the crusher with minimum wear and power consumption. No grates are used. The American Impactor is resistant to uncrushables and plugging.
