The Mining Process. 1. Mining - Open Pit and Underground — To define the ore from the waste rock, samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock, which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

Miners, mining materials and equipment are transported deep underground via the mine cage in the vertical shaft, which can go to depths of up to 3.5km below the surface. Open-pit gold mining also takes place in South Africa. This is a mining technique which excavates at the surface to extract ore.

The world's gold production has changed over the past 30 years. The exploration and discovery of large, free-milling gold deposits in major mining districts has declined. Mining companies face a difficult decision. Do they process large, low-grade deposits or look for smaller, often more complex ones in remote, often hard-to-reach locations?

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

Feb 18, 2021Generally, silver is also dissolved by the cyanide solution and follows the gold through the process sequence. Iron sulfide minerals, which are common constituents of gold ores, are oxidized to some extent during the cyanide leach, thus resulting in the formation of acid. These acids are neutralized by the lime used in the cyanide leach sequence.
