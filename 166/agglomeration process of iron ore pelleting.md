## Low-Carbon Production of Iron & Steel: Technology Options, Economic 
Mar 8, 2021From a technical perspective, the challenge of decarbonization involves two processes: chemical reduction for iron ore refining (process emission), commonly with metallurgical coal and coke, and from the high temperature heat sourced required to operate BF and other production reactors [(Friedmann et al., 2019)].
