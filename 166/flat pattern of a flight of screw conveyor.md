If the flight involves varying sheet thickness, or literal stretching (not just bending) of material, SW (& other "mid-range" 3D systems) will not be able to create a flat. The sheet thickness is to be uniform (not varying). I assume the flight is (basically) like a stretched spring with a rectangulr profile bent the 'wrong' way.
