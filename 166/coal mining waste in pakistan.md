## Mine Tailings Disposal Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
As has been pointed out earlier in this section, immense quantities of wastes are produced by coal mining activities. Many of the regulations governing these wastes have only recently been enacted, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (PL 9587) will be a major factor influencing coal mining waste management in the future

The mining industry plays a leading role in waste management, and is one of few industries that recycles its own waste. Uses of mine waste include: 1- Waste rock: Can be reprocessed to extract minerals and metals, used as back fill, land scaping material, aggregate in road construction, or feedstock for cement and concrete 2- Manganese tailings

## Coal mine waste gas - Clean Energy Regulator
Dec 16, 2021The coal mine waste gas method applies only to underground coal mines. The method sets out criteria for projects that reduce emissions either through flaring, oxidation, destruction, or conversion of waste gas to operate an electricity production device. These projects have a significant abatement effect as coal mine waste gas is primarily methane.
