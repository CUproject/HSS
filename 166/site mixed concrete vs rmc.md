## What is ready mix concrete and its advantages and disadvantages?
Because RMC is transported by truck, it can be expensive to deliver to remote or hard-to-reach sites. In addition, RMC can sometimes be of lower quality than concrete mixed on-site. When choosing whether to use ready mix concrete or on-site concrete mixing, consider the cost of delivery, the quality of the final product, and the labour required.

As ready mix concrete is produced in the plant in a planned and organised manner, air and noise pollution is reduced. The air pollution caused by dust is reduced in the case of RMC and wastage of cement is also reduced as cement in RMC is used in bulk. While in site mix concrete, individual bags of cement are used.
