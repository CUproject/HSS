The matte produced by the flash smelting furnace is transferred to the Converter furnace. Oxygen-enriched air is blown into the Converter furnace to oxidize the matte further to create blister copper with a grade of approximately 99%. Reaction in the converter.

Copper smelting slag is produced from copper pyrometallurgy (both smelting and converting stages), usually grading at 0.3-3%. The slag may also contains lead & zinc minerals like galena, sphalerite.  After soda refining, the copper matte is treated by cupellation method to separate copper with lead, and lead reports into slag phase.

The Romans improved on the early primitive methods, but without altering the fundamental principle; and, as already mentioned, they successfully smelted sulfide ores, which would have defied the more ancient metallurgists. In Britain there has been found in Anglesey a number of circular cakes of copper which were cast in Roman times.

Introduction to Copper Smelting Techniques. Copper ore typically contains only about 0.6% of the actual copper mineral, the most common ore mined being chalcopyrite. The ore is attained using traditional methods of underground and open pit mining, the later accounting for 90% of the ore used in smelting. The ore is crushed, screened, and washed

In the modern industry, the copper crucible is usually formed into bars of varying thickness and sizes, depending on the requirements. Copper metal is malleable enough and so it is easy to shape it.

## Copper Smelting Method - MyScienceWork
The present invention relates to a copper smelting method. BACKGROUND In a copper dry smelting process, an imbalance is caused between the supply of raw materials such as a copper concentrate and a silica concentrate, and the supply of oxygen into a furnace. As a result, the amount of oxygen becomes too large relative to the raw materials.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

See Page 1. Smelting copper ore by traditional methods had cost between $130 and $200 per tonne. The introduction of biohydro-metallurgy cut the cost to less than $70 per tonne. Production of one tonne of copper by smelting typically results in two tonnes of sulphur dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere. Biological extraction avoids this.

## Two methods of smelting phosphocopper alloys
6 days agoThe smelting method of phospho-copper alloy, in addition to the non-ferrous alloy factory which produces a large number of phospho-copper using "wet smelting", generally adopt the following two typical processes.. Prepare two graphite crucible, one crucible is baked and cooled thoroughly, put red phosphorus into it, tamp it with a wooden stick, spread dry grass ash on it, tamp it tightly, the
