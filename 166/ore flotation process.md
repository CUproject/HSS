## When is flotation method used? Explained by FAQ Blog
Both "flotation" and "floatation" are acceptable spellings for the same term, and both are used to describe the same process. "Floatation" has the older pedigree between the two words; its first confirmed use was in 1806. "Flotation" wasn't used until the 1850s, and it appears to be a derivative.

Flotation cells are commonly used in open pit mines, processing 5,000 to 200,000 tons of ore per hour. The peak capacity of a flotation cell can be up to 80 tons per hour. There are times when the flotation cell is used to clean up the slurry formed by the grinding process and before it is fed to a filter for dewatering.

The flotation process is characterized by the following:  First, the collector is added to the iron ore slurry to selectively coat the iron oxide particles, making the surface hydrophobic. The slurry then goes to a flotation cell, where air bubbles are generated using an impeller and aerator (Figure 1.2.4). At this step, the frother (for

## Froth Flotation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Jan 20, 2021Disadvantages of the flotation process: the method is quite complex and expensive, besides being influenced by the slime.  From Table 32 it will be seen that the reagent charge is likely to be the largest item even in the flotation of an ore that is comparatively easy to treat, except in the case of a very small plant, when the labour charge

## flotation | ore dressing | Britannica
flotation, in mineral processing, method used to separate and concentrate ores by altering their surfaces to a hydrophobic or hydrophilic condition—that is, the surfaces are either repelled or attracted by water. The flotation process was developed on a commercial scale early in the 20th century to remove very fine mineral particles that formerly had gone to waste in gravity concentration
