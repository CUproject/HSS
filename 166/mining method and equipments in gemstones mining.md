## A Guide to the Four Main Methods of Mining
More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's

Strip mining. Strip mining is the activity of removing a layer of earth to access the minerals that are in shallow deposits and continuing to do the same in adjacent areas without digging deeper vertically. Strip mining is best suited for shallow and horizontally located deposits. Strip mining activities often impacts a broader surface area.

## Mining : What is Mining? What are the 4 mining methods?
Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other
