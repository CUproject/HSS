Nov 13, 2020Coal power has fuelled South Africa for over 100 years and it surely would be a huge task to fill in the gap. Some African nations, including South Africa, have inspired the use of solar energy in their rural areas. However, the high cost of effective solar solutions is a negative factor.

This ranks South Africa as 6th in the list of coal-exporting nations (Engelbrecht, 2010). In 2014, South Africa produced 260Mt of coal. Of this, 182.7 Mt were sold internally, whereas 69.6 Mt were exported (CoM, 2017). This amounts to roughly a 7:3 ratio of local use to export. Thus, the majority of coal produced is used domestically (CoM, 2017).

In 2013, coal contributed R51 billion to South Africa's economy, compared with gold's R31 billion 1. Measured at current prices, coal is now king. The mineral's contribution to overall mining value added rose to 22,5% in 2013 from 17,4% in 1993. Platinum group metals (PGMs) came a close second in 2013, at 21,0%.

Further, most of the coal is located in the eastern parts of the country and requires transportation over long distances, mostly by trains, which run on diesel.
