## Use of steel scrap saves billions in climate and environmental costs 
Accordingly, the study shows that the use of steel scrap in Europe reduces the costs of climate change by up to 20 billion euros a year. The use of steel scrap saves CO2 emissions compared to the primary production of steel from ores and refined mining products. The use of steel scrap also reduces other environmental damages, such as

## Does recycling use more energy than mining? - Eco-friendly lifestyle
Sustainable recycling and reusing can, in fact, integrate with the mining industry. This will replace traditional mining and create a more digitized and sustainable mining sector that reuses and recycles its own products. Does recycling reduce landfills? One of the main reasons for recycling is to reduce the amount of garbage sent to landfills

## Cost to Recycle Metal / Desert Metal - Desert Metal Recycling
The cost of recycling the metallic object cannot be compared to the depletion and environmental destruction that arise from mining sites. Lowers the amount of energy used in making metal parts. Recycling metals such as aluminum take less the 10% of the energy and less workforce used to mine the ores, extract, and purify the metals for use.

Oct 14, 2020The recycling rate of plastics is actually quite low — in 2017, only 8.4% of plastic material generated in the U.S. was recycled. The rest was combusted for energy or sent to a landfill where its fate is uncertain — it can either find its way out and pollute our planet or sit in the landfill for up to 500 years before finally decomposing.

Oct 28, 2021It requires various machines for mining and refining raw materials, while recycling has considerably fewer energy costs. Energy is roughly 30% of primary aluminum production costs, while aluminum scrap uses 5% of the energy during production. Besides lower energy costs, scrap metal recycling can be even more efficient than mining .
