## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
Feb 3, 2022How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## iron ore processing haematite
Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral. Uses of Hematite (Iron Ore) Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world These mines
