The typical field soil compaction testing method uses a nuclear meter as well as a sand cone. Laboratory tests on the other hand utilize proctor tests to establish the optimal moisture content for a soil's compaction. Humboldt's soil density and compaction testing equipment include nuclear gauges, sand cones and the voluvessel.

## Silica Sand | Its Properties and 7 Uses of Silica Sand - Civil Click
Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
