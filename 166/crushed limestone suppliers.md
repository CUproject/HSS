## Does crushed limestone hardenfo

The resulting floor is going to be a bear to clean, something to keep in mind if you intend to have the public using it and dropping their little bits of trash all over. Personally, I'd probably put down a rough wood floor. It will look rustic, and can be kept clean with a broom.
