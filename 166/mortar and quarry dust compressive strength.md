For compressive strength of concrete mix 1:1.5:3, 1:2:4 and 1:2.5:5 were also obtained. The highest compressive strength of mortar found from stone powder which is 33.02 MPa, shows that better mortar can be prepared by the stone powder. The compressive strength of concrete from stone powder shows 14.76%

## Compressivestrength study of geopolymer mortar using quarry rock dust 
The experimental program involves casting of geopolymer mortar cubes by using GGBFS, Flyash and Quarry rock dust and testing them at 1 day, 3 days and 7 days for compressive strength. Different parameter considered in this study is alkaline fluid to binder ratio Keeping 12-Molarity of the alkaline liquid and the ratio of sodium hydroxide to
