## Ores And Minerals - Definition, Types & Differences with Videos - BYJUS
The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! Ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

Ores generate at a height of Y = 64 or lower, starting with coal ore and becoming more and more valuable as you go deeper. At a height of Y = -4096 or lower, all ores can be found at their peak probability. Ores are generated in 2 variants: small cluster and big cluster. The small cluster variant has clusters with a few ores and is usually less

The valorization of pyrochlore ores is limited to niobium recovery through a pyrometallurgical route and is only applied to ores allowing an efficient ore dressing process. New pyrochlore ore deposits, especially in Gabon Africa, contain very fine pyrochlore particles which cannot be efficiently enriched by ore dressing processes.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
