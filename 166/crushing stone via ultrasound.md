## Real‐Time Imaging of the Process of Stone Crushing by Ultrasound
A new method of lithotripsy combining high and low frequency ultrasound has been investigated. This method controls generation of cavitation only on the stone surface and utilizes collapse pressure of the bubbles. In order to apply this method for clinical practice, it is important to monitor the process of stone crushing and behavior of cavitation from outside the body.

## Crushing of kidney stones with ultrasound and laser
The procedure for crushing stones in the kidneys is carried out with a holmium laser. Due to the action of a thin beam of concentrated light, moisture evaporates from the formation. Point effect allows to avoid damage to soft tissues. In addition, the maximum penetration depth of the laser is 0.5 millimeters.
