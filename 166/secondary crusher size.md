Metso impact crusher. Impact crushers can be used as primary crushers, secondary crushers or tertiary crushers depending on the size and technology. They are equipped with beaters, also called hammers, and impact plates. They operate in the following way: they are fed from the upper part, then the stones are hit by the hammers and projected towards the plates.

Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.

## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022A high-quality hammer crusher can keep final material 100% passing a twenty mesh, fifty to sixty percent passing a fifty-mesh screen. Crusher hammers are high chrome content. The hammer service life depends on the material you process. If you're running abrasive quartz, they'll last somewhere between one to two weeks.

The top size of the material ends up typically in the range of 200 - 350 mm, which is good for belt conveyors and fits into most secondary crushers without causing process risks. To achieve this top size, the crusher setting is in the range of 200 mm or below, depending on the rock characteristics.
