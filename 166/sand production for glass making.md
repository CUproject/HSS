## Glass
Glass can form naturally from volcanic magma. Obsidian is a common volcanic glass with high silica (SiO 2) content formed when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly. Impactite is a form of glass formed by the impact of a meteorite, where Moldavite (found in central and eastern Europe), and Libyan desert glass (found in areas in the eastern Sahara, the deserts of eastern Libya and

Glass making is an ancient craft. Mother Nature can make glass when lightning strikes a sandy beach. Sand is the compound silicon dioxide, and at temperatures of around 1,760 degrees Celsius (3,200 degrees Fahrenheit), it melts to create a form of glass called quartz. Pure silicon melts at 1,414 degrees Celsius (2,577 degrees Fahrenheit), but

This occurs in glass manufacture and in silica gel production. Silica is a fairly widely used ceramic material both as a precursor to the fabrication of other ceramic products and as a material on its own. Silica has considerably low thermal expansion, a fairly high melting point and is resistant to creep, making it a good refractory material.
