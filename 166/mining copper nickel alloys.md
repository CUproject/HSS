Aluminum alloys are second only to steels in use as structural metals. Aluminum has a density of only 2.7 g/cm3, approximately one-third as much as steel (7.83 g/cm3). One cubic foot of steel weighs about 490 lb; a cubic foot of aluminum, only about 170 lb. Such light weight, coupled with the high strength of some aluminum alloys > (exceeding that of struc-.

## Copper-Nickel Alloys
The addition of nickel to copper improves strength and corrosion resistance while allowing the alloy to remain ductile. Other elements can be added to copper-nickel to increase strength, corrosion resistance, hardening, weldability and castability.. 90-10 copper-nickel (C70600, CW352H), an alloy with 90% copper and 10% nickel, is the most commonly used alloy.

## nickel processing | Britannica
Nickel was used industrially as an alloying metal almost 2,000 years before it was isolated and recognized as a new element. As early as 200 bce the Chinese made substantial amounts of a white alloy from zinc and a copper-nickel ore found in Yunnan province. The alloy, known as pai-t'ung, was exported to the Middle East and even to Europe.

## Cupronickel
Cupronickel or copper-nickel (CuNi) is an alloy of copper that contains nickel and strengthening elements, such as iron and manganese.The copper content typically varies from 60 to 90 percent. (Monel is a nickel-copper alloy that contains a minimum of 52 percent nickel.)Despite its high copper content, cupronickel is silver in colour. Cupronickel is highly resistant to corrosion by salt water

## Mining Copper Nickel Alloys
Copper-Nickel Alloys. Non-marine applications for copper-nickel include cryogenic applications, brake tubing and silver-colored coins, such as the 1- and 2-euro denominations and the 5-cent U.S. nickel.Since copper-nickel alloys have strong antimicrobial properties, they are marketed as hygienic "touch materials" to reduce cross-contamination and infections, particularly in hospital intensive

## Fabrication of copper-nickel alloys | Nickel Institute
Fabrication of copper-nickel alloys. Fabricating 90-10 and 70-30 copper-nickel alloys is straightforward; they are ductile and easily formed although they require a higher degree of cleanliness than for steels. Machinability is similar to that of aluminium bronze, phosphor bronzes and other copper alloys that do not contain free-cutting additions.
