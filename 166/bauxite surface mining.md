## Bauxite
Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

## Mining and Refining - Process - World Aluminium
Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

Since then, however, the process has shifted to the more economical, safe and environmentally friendly surface mining, and today Wirtgen surface miners extract 100% of the ore. Since 2001, the Wirtgen technology has proven its additional benefit to the growing bauxite mining industry in Guinea, where 25 Wirtgen machines are currently in operation.

The Boké Mine in Guinea, Africa, holds some of the world's highest-quality bauxite deposits. To efficiently extract, process and transport the material from the mine, located approximately 30 km (18.6 miles) from the northern shores of the Rio Nuñez in Boké Prefecture, the Société Minière de Boké mining company (SMB) was formed in 2014.

## Bauxite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Surface mining is more common than underground mining because most of the bauxite deposits occur near the surface. The extraction of bauxite takes place by shallow, open-cut mining following the open-pit method. The bauxite ores content is of different types and the most amount of clay, and need to be washed before the process (Donoghue et al

Bauxite mining, which is considered as surface mining, is land extensive, noisy and dusty. Mining pits are often interspersed with small rural communities, thereby requiring companies relocate the people and/or to monetarily compensate them.
