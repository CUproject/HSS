May 13, 2021pper ore benefi ion methods and process. Copper ore is extracted using two basic methods of mining - open pit or underground mining. 3. Processing of Copper Ore. The first step in processing the ore removed from the mine is to break the large rocks of ore into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by a variety of subsequent processing steps. 4.

## Research On Copper-molybdenum Ore Flotation Separation Process
1 day agoYe Lijia conducted an experimental study on a low-grade copper-molybdenum ore in Anhui and found that when kerosene was used as a collector and BK301C was used as an auxiliary collector for copper-molybdenum mixing, the recovery rate of copper and molybdenum could reach 93.3 g/t at a dosage of 59 g/t, respectively. 01% and 73.2%, the effect is
