## Methods to repair cast iron sewer drains without digging through floors
Option 3: replace drain pipe by digging through the floor. This is absolutely the worst possible method because it takes a number of weeks to dig up all the concrete, then dig through the soil which has to be replaced, and then to replace the concrete.  Keep in mind that when concrete is we poured it is "green". That means it needs about

## Sloping existing concrete floor to drain
Sloping existing concrete floor to drain. I'm planning to adapt an existing concreted bay in a pole barn to be a milkhouse for a small dairy we're opening. The slab is very thick and flat, not sloped. State law requires us have it graded to drain. As this room will be housing dairy equipment to be washed, it will be wet a lot of the time.

Light in weight but very strong. Up to 60 % of raw materials can be saved in comparison to solid walled plastic pipes. The strength of the pipes is given by the corrugated design of the outer wall and not by wall thickness, as it applies for solid wall pipes. Less manpower is needed for the installation of the pipes due to the low weight.
