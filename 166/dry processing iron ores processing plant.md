## Iron ore processing plant - CDE Asia
Using perfectly calibrated clean ore reduces coke consumption by upto 6%. Processing Iron Ore maximizes recovery of calibrated lumps. CDE wet screening technology can efficiently recover material upto minus 2mm size, with highest efficiency around the year, even during the monsoon season, which typically traditional dry screens fail to achieve.

Screening: The first one is screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage.; Crushing and stockpiling: This step involves breaking up the iron ore to obtain an F80 grind size before it can be ground. Once the ore is crushed, it is diverted to a stockpile and then fed into the mill; Grinding: The primary grinding mill grinds the material
