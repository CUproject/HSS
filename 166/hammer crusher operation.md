## Hammermill Crushers | McLanahan
Hammermill Crushers are known to generate material finer than 3/16" (4mm), which in some applications may be undesirable. However, if there is a market for finer material, or if it is acceptable within the desired product size, Hammermills can achieve reduction ratios that may otherwise require multiple crushers.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

## impact hammer crusher operation
Hammer crusher has a compact structure. After a strict inspection, all the parts installed can achieve a long time of normal operation. How does a hammer crusher work? Hammer crusher mainly relies on the impact force to complete the crushing. When the hammer crusher works, the motor drives the rotor in high-speed rotation.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
