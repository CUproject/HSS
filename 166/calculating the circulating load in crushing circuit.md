## Open or Closed Circuit Crushing - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
How Much Circulating Load. In designing a closed-circuit crushing stage, the question of how much circulating load should be carried is a very important one. It not only has a direct bearing upon the capacity of the stage; it determines the amount of screening surface, and the elevating capacity necessary to handle the load in the circuit.
