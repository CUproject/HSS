## Finding Solutions for South Africa's Coal-Fired Energy and Water 
This post originally appeared on The Guardian's Water hub.. Coal production, from mining to power generation, requires vast volumes of water.Furthermore, pollution from coal mining can irreparably harm water resources.. In South Africa—one of the world's most water-stressed countries and one of the largest producers and consumers of coal—the water-energy nexus is a topic of great concern.
