E) Problems of Coal Mining in India. The distribution of coal is uneven across the national regions. High ash content and low caloric value, high sulphur and phosphorus, more possibility of environmental pollution. Clean coal mining technologies are expensive and out of reach of Indian PSUs. Most of coal is dug out from underground mines.

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.

## Coal in India
Coal in India has been mined since 1774, and India is the second largest producer and consumer of coal after China, mining 777.31 million metric tons (856.84 million short tons) in FY 2022.Around 30% of coal is imported. Due to high demand and poor average quality, India imports coking coal to meet the requirements of its steel plants. Dhanbad, the largest coal producing city, has been called

Depending upon the percentage of carbon present, the coal can be grouped in four types, such as peat, lignite, bituminous and anthracite. 1. Peat: It represents the first stage of coal formation, i.e. from wood to coal, today, peat is being formed at many places. It has a high percentage of moisture and volatile matter.

2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

## What are the types of coal? | U.S. Geological Survey
There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.
