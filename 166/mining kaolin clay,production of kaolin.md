Firing is the most important manufacturing process stage, because, when the semi-hardened elements travel through the kiln, they undergo fundamental transformations in their physico-chemical properties. The processed pieces are subjected to a high-temperature thermal cycle up to 1300 C. The length of the kiln can be more than hundreds of meters.

## Kaolin | Energy & Mining
Kaolin. Kaolin (hydrated aluminium silicate, Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) is the most important of the industrial clays in terms of both consumption and value. Properties of fine particle size, platy shape, inertness, non-toxicity, and high brightness and whiteness make it a most versatile mineral, with applications in a wide variety of industries.

## What is Kaolin | The Kaolin and Ball Clay Association
Kaolin or china clay is a commercial clay composed principally of the hydrated aluminosilicate clay mineral kaolinite. The commercial value of kaolin is based on the mineral's whiteness and its fine, controllable particle size.  Kaolin production is confined to the primary deposits within the granites of South-West England, Hensbarrow (St
