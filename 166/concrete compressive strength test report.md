## Compressive Strength of Concrete | Cube Test - The Civil Engineering
Aug 24, 2021Compressive strength of Concrete Formula: The Compressive strength of specimen can be calculated by dividing maximum load carried by the specimen by cross-sectional area of the specimen cubes. The surface area of specimen: = 150 x 150 = 22500mm² = 225cm² Assume, The Max compression load is 450KN.

Windsor Probe field test values by themselves varied between 5,300 psi and 6,800 psi. However, after applying the 'best fit' equation to field test data, adjusted Windsor Probe test values ranged between 1,000 psi and 1,300 psi. The correlated strength values were more consistent with concrete core compressive strengths.

Compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the cross-sectional area resisting the load and reported in units of pound-force per square inch (psi) or megapascals (MPa

## Compressive Strength of Concrete | Cube Test, Procedure, calculation 
Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load carried by specimen / Cross Sectional Area surface of specimen. Take it as, Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 1500mm = 22500 mm 2 or 225 cm 2. Assume the compression load is 400 KN, Compressive Strength = (400000 /22500) = 17.77 /9.81 = 181.22 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N

## Compressive Strength of Concrete, Compression Test - techyildiz
Jul 25, 2022ASTM C39, for example, specifies a common test procedure for determining the compressive strength of concrete cylinders. 1- Concrete is poured into the mold and properly compacted to reduce the air bubbles inside of it. 2- Moulds are removed after 24 hours, and test specimens are placed in water for curing.

The lower the w/c ratio, generally, the higher the durability of the concrete for most applications. For 3000 psi concrete, the w/c ratio can be as high as about 0.60. For 4000 psi concrete, the w/c ratio can be in the range of 0.50 to 0.52, depending on other aspects of the mix design. Review ACI and PCA requirements for mix designs.
