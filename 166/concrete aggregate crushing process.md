## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

## High-quality coarse aggregate recycling from waste concrete by impact 
This study presents a liberation process for recycling high-quality coarse aggregates from waste concrete by impacting with steel grits. Considering the mortar liberation ratio and specific energy for the liberation process as well as the water absorption and apparent density of the recycled coarse aggregates (RCA), the effects of impact velocity, impact time, and concrete strength on the
