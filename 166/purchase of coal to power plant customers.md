It was burned in fireplaces in ancient Rome and in Hopi ovens in what would eventually become the American Southwest. During the industrial revolution, coal was used to power large furnaces and steam engines, necessitating deeper and more dangerous coal mines. Coal production jumped from 10 million tons in 1800 to 250 million tons in 1900.
