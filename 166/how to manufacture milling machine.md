"Forget the bearings its all about the width and depth of cut. If the bits sharp and narrow the z axis on a non counterbalanced machine may be doing little more than letting gravity make the cut! A 1/8â€³ wide sharp cutter in a bridgeport spindle will easily take a thou per pass with just minimal pressure on the quill handle.

## Design guide for CNC Milling - EngineeringClicks
While this can sometimes be handled by 4- or 5-axis milling, on a typical 3-axis machine multiple setups will be required. Each setup costs additional time and money, especially when the volume of parts to be machined isn't very high. If possible, reducing the number of setups required to make a part is an excellent way to save time and money.

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes
Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed, the overall removal is quite brisk.

6063. This is really similar in function to 6061, but this is more common to see in extrusions. However, it isn't quite as stiff. This makes 6063 a little harder to machine; it's softer and gummier. When you're cutting aluminum extrusions, use really sharp tools, good lubrication, and watch your chip clearance.
