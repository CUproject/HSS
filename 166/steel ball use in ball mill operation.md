Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## steel ball use in ball mill operation
Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses  Several types of ball mill exist. They differ to an extent in their operating principle. They also differ in their maximum capacity of the milling vessel, ranging from 0.010 litres for planetary ball mill, mixer mill or vibration ball mill to several 100 litres for horizontal rolling ball mills.
