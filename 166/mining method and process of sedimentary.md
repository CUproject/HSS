## Unit 4 Reading: Sedimentary Processes - Student Materials
Introduction. Sedimentary processes, namely weathering, erosion, crystallization, deposition, and lithification, create the sedimentary family of rocks. Most of Earth's surface is covered by sediments (like mud, sand, and gravel), and the majority of rocks you will see (the majority of rocks exposed at Earth's surface) are sedimentary rocks

Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earth's surface. Overlying rock is blasted and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery. As pictured in figure 2, surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

MINING METHODS. The method of extracting the ore is dependent upon the nature of the ore occurrence. Each orebody is a problem in itself. All influencing factors, as size, shape, position, nature and grade of an orebody, and character of the enclosing walls, are fully considered before the method of extraction is decided.

 Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining - Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface.
