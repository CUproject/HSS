Applying the crushing force by rolling the nut breaks flats and gives a product that is more "cubic" than the jaw crusher. - The largest-scale equipment can treat a flow with the magnitude of 4,000 tonne.h − 1. - With a production rate and flow that are equal, the power consumed by a gyratory crusher is similar to a jaw crusher.

## Analysis of the Single Toggle Jaw Crusher Force Transmission  - Hindawi
Today, the most commonly used types of jaw crusher are the single toggle and the double toggle designs. The original double toggle jaw crusher was designed by Eli Whitney Blake in the USA in 1857 . The motion of the swing jaw in a double toggle crusher is such that it applies an almost purely compressive force upon the material being crushed.

Desired crushing takes place when fed particles experience pressure exerted by the jaw blade action. By this action the particles are crushed to smaller sizes. The product size will depend upon the crusher blade gap and feed particle nature. We can customise the outout size based on the requirement and application.

## Forces Present In Jaw R Gyratory Crusher
Jaw crusher movement is guided by pivoting one end of the swinging jaw. and an eccentric motion located at the opposite end. [4] The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws .For instance, a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22 by 30, a 46 x 46 jaw crusher has a opening of 46 square.
