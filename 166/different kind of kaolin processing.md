## Kaolin Processing Technology and Characteristics
The particle size of kaolin is the key to measure the quality of its products. There are certain requirements for the particle size of kaolin in the fields of papermaking, coatings, and rubber and plastics, so it is necessary to superfine the kaolin. Because kaolin has a lamellar structure, the ultrafine crushing of kaolin is also called peeling.

## Using Kaolin in Reduction of Arsenic in Rice Grains: Effect of 
Kaolin was used as a soil amendment to study the effect of different types of kaolin, pH and arsenic complex on arsenic accumulation in rice grains from arsenic (As) contaminated soil. It was found that kaolin released soluble aluminium (Al) and silicon at a pH value of 3. As adsorption by crude kaolin was higher than by washed kaolin and treated kaolin due to the higher Al content found in
