Summary. Mirror grinding and figuring consists of four major steps (plus aluminizing). Rough and Fine grinding use hard tools (glass, tile or metal) and harder then glass abrasive grit (Silicon Carbide or Aluminum Oxide). Polishing and Figuring use a soft pitch tool and ultra fine abrasive (Cerium Oxide or Rouge).

Let's break down the process into 5 steps. Rough grinding. This step is about making one side of the glass concave. It will give your mirror its overall focal ratio. If you make the centre deep, you will end up with a fast telescope (e.g. F/D = 4) well suited for deep sky observations.

Silveringâ€”the process of coating the back of a glass sheet with melted silverâ€”became the most popular method for making mirrors in the 1600s. The glass used in these early mirrors was often warped, creating a ripple in the image.  It is due to these irregularities that some mirrors make you look thinner and some fatter than normal. If

Kafka's mirroring feature makes it possible to maintain a replica of an existing Kafka cluster. The following diagram shows how to use the MirrorMaker tool to mirror a source Kafka cluster into a target (mirror) Kafka cluster. The tool uses a Kafka consumer to consume messages from the source cluster, and re-publishes those messages to the local (target) cluster using an embedded Kafka producer.

Making Magic Mirrors for Scrying and Divination. "We should be a mirror of being: We are God in miniature.".

This process included heating lead and adding mercury, gold, silver, copper, iron filings, and dry herbs.

## The History of Mirror: Through A Glass, Darkly
As the Roman Empire ascended, mirror-making appeared in every land where Romans settledâ€”including England. Then, upon the the collapse of cultures and economies during what used to be called The Dark Ages (a perfect mirror metaphor)â€”e.g., the Early Middle Ages, mirror-making appears to have died out. Few artifacts exisit from c. 5-10AD.

Ptolemaic Egypt had manufactured small glass mirrors backed by lead, tin, or antimony.

## How are mirrors made? - Office for Science and Society
Craftsmen adept at making mirrors guarded the secrets of their process jealously. A discovery by the great German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1835 made mirrors widely available. Liebig found a way to coat glass with a thin layer of metallic silver by depositing the metal directly by means of a chemical reaction.
