## Grindability Work Index For Iron Ore
Grindability Index Iron Ore In Thailand. The relative grindability of coal canada method the hardgrove method and the cross method. an important phase of this paper is the discussion of particle-size determination by the sedimen- using certain surface factors and the grinding index is obtained by subtracting the surface of the initial product from that of the final product.

## Comparative Analysis of Grindability of Iron‐ ore and Granite
The most widely used parameter to 1) measure ore grindability is the Bond work index (Wi). This measures the resistance of materials to breakage.
