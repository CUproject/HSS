Copper extraction. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27-29% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of pyrite

The most difficult particles to gravity concentrate are the fines, and 75 microns to 2 microns are definitely very fine. So, even if the ore were ground to 2 microns, it may not be recoverable using current gravity technology. That appears to leave froth flotation as still the best method of recovering the gold from pyritic ores.
