## From The Quarry To The Kitchen: How Natural Stone Is Quarried
The diamond-wire saw, as the name indicates, is a type of saw used in quarrying. The wire saw uses synthetic diamonds as the abrasion to cut through the stone. The saw basically consists of two parts: an engine and a steel wire laced with diamond-impregnated beads. This wire is fed through previously drilled channels.

No explosive material is used at any stage in this method of quarrying of stones. Soft rocks and also those rocks which have layered structure are easily quarried by these methods. As a first step, the loose cover of soil over the rock (the over-burden) is first removed and the rock surface is cleared.
