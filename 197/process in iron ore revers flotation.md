## Optimal Control of Iron Ore Flotation with Soft Sensors for Grade and 
For Brazilian iron ore producers, reverse cationic flotation is preferred to obtain high quality concentrates from silicate ores. The SiO2 (silica) particles are rendered hydrophobic by amine (cationic collector) in alkaline conditions, while iron is depressed by the addition of starch.

## Reverse cationic flotation of iron ores with complex silicate  - AusIMM
Froth flotation of iron ores is one of the most widely used methods to upgrade iron ore into high-grade concentrates. In recent years, reverse cationic flotation of iron ores has been specifically the subject of several studies. Since quartz is the most common gangue mineral in iron ores, understanding the behaviour of this mineral was the main target of the majority of such studies.

## Iron Ore Fines Grinding Process
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50 needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

For Phosphate, flotation is, in general, very important to upgrading the phosphate rock and is employed in this study to beneficiate a 20% P2O5 feed content to a 30-32% P2O5 content. The growing fertilizer industry has increased the demand for phosphate rock from which super-phosphates are produced. The fertilizer market is very competitive.
