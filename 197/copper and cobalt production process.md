## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? - ThoughtCo
The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

In 1977, Noranda began redevelopment of the deposit, conducting extensive drilling and metallurgical testing. Noranda devised a process for treating a concentrate containing 0.36 pct Cu. This process comprised oxidative pressure leaching at 155° C and conventional precipitation techniques for cobalt recovery.

Cobalt naturally occurs in nickel-bearing laterites and nickel-copper sulfide deposits and, thus, is most often extracted as a by-product of nickel and copper. According to the Cobalt Development Institute, about 48% of cobalt production originates from nickel ores, 37% from copper ores and 15% from primary cobalt production.

## Cobalt
Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.. Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times for
