Jan 17, 2022Using the manufacturer's recommendations, place the cement, sand, (aggregates if making concrete), and water into separate plastic buckets. For a standard concrete mix, you will have to combine one part cement and two parts sand with four parts aggregates. Then, Measure around half of the cement, sand and aggregates (for a concrete mix only

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.
