## Mining Process | BNI Coal
The final step in the mining process is the removal of the lignite from the pit. This is done with a fleet of bottom dump trucks loaded with a large front end loader.  Once the coal is removed from the pit the mining process is complete and the reclamation process can begin. Today, lignite coal-based electricity is a low-cost, efficient and

Stage one in coal production is peat. Peat is a fibrous substance that is oxidized by water and carbon dioxide. When a plant dies, and stays under water, it builds up an accumulation of peat. Peat, when burned, produces a lot of smoke and a large flame and therefore is rarely used as a heat source. Stage two of the coal formation process is
