calcination, the heating of solids to a high temperature for the purpose of removing volatile substances, oxidizing a portion of mass, or rendering them friable. Calcination, therefore, is sometimes considered a process of purification. A typical example is the manufacture of lime from limestone. In this process the limestone is brought to a temperature high enough to expel the carbon dioxide

## What is burnt in a limestone kiln to provide the heat?
What type of reaction is heating limestone? When limestone is heated in a kiln, the calcium carbonate breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This type of reaction is called thermal decomposition. The process is called calcining. Once burnt limestone turns into calcium oxide which is known as quicklime.

Calcination is the process of heating a solid material in order to cause chemical separation of its components. The diversity of chemical separation lends calcination to accomplishing a range of objectives, from the removal of chemically bound (crystalline) water, to the volatilization of contaminants from a source material, thermal decomposition, and even phase changes.

## Why is it called calcining?d.il
What is the temperature of calcining zone? Calcining occurs when the hot combustion gases from the combustion of primary fuels dissociates calcium carbonate from the limestone to form calcium oxide. In this region of the kiln, temperatures are in a range of 600°C to 900°C. The third region of the kiln is known as the burning or sintering zone.
