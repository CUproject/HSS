## Difference between a flow regulator and a pressure regulator?
The higher the pressure differences the higher the flow. Pumps are rated for pressure but that is for the strength that it can with stand before breaking. "a pressure regulator regulates the pressure from upstream to required pressure downstream". Most of the time it is the other way round. You need backpressure for a regulator to work.

By maintaining a constant flow rate of oil to each bearing pocket, any reduction in land gap produced by an increase in applied load also increases the pocket pressure to compensate.
