## Group Preference Aggregation: A Nash Equilibrium Approach
Abstract: Group-oriented services such as group recommendations aim to provide services for a group of users. For these applications, how to aggregate the preferences of different group members is the toughest yet most important problem. Inspired by game theory, in this paper, we propose to explore the idea of Nash equilibrium to simulate the selections of members in a group by a game process.

## An efficient aggregation scheme resisting on malicious data mining 
By using secure data aggregation techniques, the gateway first aggregates the n encrypted metering data into one encrypted value, and then send it to the control center. After decrypting, the control center can only obtain the aggregation results (e.g., sum, average) but not the individual metering data.

## Data Aggregation | Data Aggregation Examples and Tools 2022 - Datamation
May 7, 2021The aggregation is done through software tools known as data aggregators. Data aggregators typically include features for collecting, processing and presenting aggregate data, and some perform a highly specialized single task. When data is aggregated it is placed into what is known as atomic data, which means the lowest level of detail.
