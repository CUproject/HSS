The SEM analysis revealed that the platelets of bentonite in f-MB do not form normal bentonite sheets, but they have been restructured in a more compact formation with a great porosity. Regarding the sorption efficiencies (Qm), the maximum phosphate sorption efficiencies (Qm) calculated using the Langmuir model were 24.54, 25.09, 26.13, 24.28

## Bentonite Slurry Disposal: Transportation & Disposal Services
Small quantities of bentonite suspended in water form a viscous, shear thinning material often referred to as bentonite slurry. At high enough concentrations, bentonite suspensions begin to take on the characteristics of a gel. For these reasons, it is a common component of drilling mud used to curtail drilling fluid invasion by its propensity for aiding in the formation of mud cake.

And even when we can recycle plastic waste, it is not always actually recycled at all. Often, recycling simply isn't economically viable for authorities and businesses. When oil prices are low, it can be cheaper to make new raw plastics (e.g plastic packaging) than to recycle, which poses a major problem economically.

The pulp and paper industry is one of the major consumer and polluters of freshwater. Approximately, 85% of the water consumed in the paper production is polluted, mainly in the pulp forming stage. For this reason, wastewater reuse in the process is one of the major issues that this industry needs to address.

## Why Recycling Is Not Enough To Solve Our Plastic Issue - Naturpac
Only 9% of the global plastic is actually recycled. This means that the remaining 91% of all plastic we ever used still exists somewhere, even when placed in the bin. There are several different types of plastic, but only a few can gain a new life. From the few that can be recycled, they are limited to a certain number of times.

This causes very serious pollution of the entire environment - air, soil and water. That pollution can be significantly reduced with recycling, especially when it comes to metals, as they do not lose quality over time and can be recycled a great number of times. Increasing recycling rates decreases the need for raw materials and removes a big
