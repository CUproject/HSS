Beam-column joint must transfer the forces, such as moment, shear and torsion, transferred by the beam to the column so that the structure can maintain its integrity to carry loads for which it is designed. Another function of the beam-column joint is to help the structure to dissipate seismic forces so that it can behave in a ductile manner.

The quickest way to create new joints at beam / column intersections is to run a Model Merge.  The Icr Factor is used to reduce the bending stiffness of concrete beams. For ACI and Canadian codes (ACI 318-14 Section 6.6.3.1 and A23.3-04 section 9.2.1.2), if this entry is left blank, the Icr factor will default to a value of 0.35 for beams

## Concrete Corbel Design to ACI 318-14 - Structural Calc
Jan 1, 2021A corbel is designed to support another member, usually a beam or girder, but may also be used to support a slab. ACI 318 restricts the term "corbel" to a member having span-to-depth ratio which is less than or equal to 1.0. Corbels are widely used in precast concrete construction. This technical background discusses the requirements for

##  Design of Reinforced Concrete Beams per ACI 318-02
To compute the strength of a member using the strength design method of the ACI code requires that two basic conditions need be satisfied: (1) static equilibrium, and (2) compatibility of strains. The following assumptions are made in defining the behavior of a beam member with span-to-depth (Ln/h) ratio greater than 4: 1.

## Column Design Principles | Column Design as per ACI Code
Column Design as per ACI codes. A structural component having a ratio of height to least lateral dimension greater than 3. Hold up vertical loads shift those loads toward the footings. Generally support compressive loads with or with no bending. Sorts of Columns - categorized into 3 sorts in accordance with reinforcement.
