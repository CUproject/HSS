## Choose right speed to improve ball mill grinding efficiency
Too fast or too slow rotation speed will weaken or lose the crushing effect. Fodamon engineers introduce you to different grinding effects at different speeds. In order for the ball mill to perform normal grinding operations, its working speed must be less than the critical speed. Ball mills generally work in a "dropped" state.

As regards the effect of rotational speed, N opt decreases from about 8 to about 6 rev/h when t 1 rises from 25.6 °C to 34.3 °C. In fact, the adsorption rate of the desiccant wheel is higher at a lower process air inlet temperature, therefore the optimal rotation speed increases to lead the desiccant material away from the equilibrium state.

## what is the optimum rotation speed for a ball mill
A Ball Mill grinds material by rotating a cylinder with steel grinding balls, causing the balls to fall back into the cylinder and onto the material to be ground. The rotation is usually between 4 to 20 revolutions per minute, depending upon the diameter of the mill. The larger the diameter, the slower the rotation.

## effect of rotational speed on ballmills
The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed", and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed. Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed

## Rotation Speed Of Ball Mill
Rotational Speed Of Ball Milling Method - Xinhai. May 06, 2016 When the rotational speed is at the critical speed, the motion of steel balls could reach the best grinding effect. It is the smallest speed that contributes to a centrifugal motion of steel balls, as well as the biggest speed that prevents the centrifugal motion.

## What it is the optimun speed for a ball mill ? - Pyrotechnics
Posted 21 October 2006 - 04:24 PM. Congratulations on your ball mill! You'll want to further reduce your motor speed by 3:1 to mill more efficiently. Right now, your RPM is just slightly under the speed where the media won't do any work. The optimum speed for your jar to turn is around 90 RPM like Frozentech said.

increase of mill speed and optimum speed was not reached in the range of chosen mill speed fractions. Again the rate of breakage was plotted as a function of particle size, the optimum size was 0.8 mm when milling at 30% critical speed. As for 20% and 30% optimum size was not reached. The selection function parameters estimated at
