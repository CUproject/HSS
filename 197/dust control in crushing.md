The transportation process of demolition materials in nearly all industries creates pesky dust. At concrete crushing facilities, dust is generated at multiple points. Front end loaders, hoppers, and conveyor discharge points all bring dust when operational. Front end loaders transfer the incoming demolition materials to the hopper.

## How to Control Dust When Cutting Concrete
1. Use Wet Control Methods. You can reduce silica dust generation when cutting concrete by employing wet cutting techniques. Wet systems hold water in pressurized tanks, which spray a continuous moisture stream onto the saw's rotating blade as it cuts through the concrete. This process significantly lowers dust emissions and promotes faster
