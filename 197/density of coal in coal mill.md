## Metallurgical coal
Metallurgical coal or coking coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke.Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking. The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel. Primary steelmaking companies often have a division that produces coal for coking, to ensure a stable and low-cost supply

## Coal Grinding - Cement Plant Optimization
Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content

## What is the unit weight of coal? - Origin of coal
What is density of coal? Coal is slightly denser than water (1.0 megagram per cubic metre) and significantly less dense than most rock and mineral matter (e.g., shale has a density of about 2.7 megagrams per cubic metre and pyrite of 5.0 megagrams per cubic metre).What does a cubic metre of coal weigh? Therefore one cubic metre of anthracite would (on his figures) be over 1.4 tonnes.

## The density of coal is ________ when compared to coke. - Vedantu
Answer. Hint: The term density is defined as the mass present per unit volume. The formation of coal is done by the incomplete combustion process of wood and whereas the coke is formed by the calcination process of mineral coal.

## Coal dust
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverizing of coal.Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.. Grinding coal to dust before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning and makes the coal easier to handle.
