## what type of coal is used to make cement
Cement Plants: Coal. London coal gas production began in 1813 and by 1842 was producing 300,000 tons of coke a year, so coke was also readily available, and, being essentially a waste product, was cheaper than coal. Early cement plants used coal for drying slurry and for power generation, and coke for kiln burning.

Coal is still used in approximately 90% of cement plants globally to deliver the energy needed for the heat inside the kiln. Online coal analyzers using PGNAA technology are used to control the coal blend to a specific GCV in addition to the ash value of the coal as this adds raw materials to the process as well.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Why coal is needed in cement industry? - Origin of coal
What type of coal is used in cement plants? Bituminous coals make the best coke and are in any case the most common, and these are most often used in the cement industry, although steam coals are occasionally used. When burning a pulverised fuel, higher volatiles are preferred because they speed up ignition and allow a coarser grind to be used.

The big picture: Coal is the most emissions-intensive fossil fuel, and steel and cement production account for more than 20% of the world's use. While options exist to reduce or eliminate coal from those processes, many of the necessary technologies require policies, incentives and new markets to bring down the costs of commercial deployment.
