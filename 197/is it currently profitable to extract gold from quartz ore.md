Removing the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold,panies useplex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.
