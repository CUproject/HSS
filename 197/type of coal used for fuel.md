## What Type of Rock Is Coal? Types, Uses, and Formation
Uses, Types, and Formation. Coal is a metamorphic rock of organic origin. Its thermodynamic properties allow obtaining a large amount of heat energy during its combustion process. Therefore, it is a type of fossil fuel. The energy obtained through its combustion is called fossil energy. It has a high calorific value due to its high carbon content.

## What is coal used for?rin
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity.

used coal for heating, and later for cooking. Burning coal was easier because coal burned longer than wood and, therefore, did not have to be collected as often. People began using coal in the 1800s to heat their homes. Trains and ships used coal for fuel. Factories used coal to make iron and steel. Today, we burn coal mainly to make electricity.

## Can coal plants be converted to natural gas?
Two different methods are used to switch coal-fired plants to natural gas. The first method is to retire the coal-fired plant and replace it with a new natural gas-fired combined-cycle (NGCC) plant. The second method is to convert the boiler of a coal-fired steam plant to burn other types of fuel, such as natural gas.
