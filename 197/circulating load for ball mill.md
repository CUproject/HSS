## ball mill circulating load from cyclone solids
ball mills, the reason for the huge dif-ference in circuit efficiencies shown by the Davis relationship suddenly became clear. With the low circulat-ing load, the ball mill was relatively full of fines (P80 product size or finer material). Therefore, most of the grinding energy of the mill was be-ing wasted.
