## jaw crusher_working principle_stone crusher
Working principle. Jaw crusher mainly consists of fixed jaw plate, mobile jaw plate, protection plate, mobile jaw bar, and so on. In operation, it motivates with electrical motor and then rotating eccentric spindle and jaw plate. Material will be crushed by squeezing, cracking, impacting, and crushing, and finally qualified material will be

## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.
