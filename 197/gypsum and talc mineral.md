Gypsum is a hydrated calcium sulfate and is the most common sulfate mineral. It is also the most common evaporate, meaning a deposit that is left after water evaporates. The name gypsum is derived from Greek word gypsos, meaning 'plaster,' as it is used in plasters, such as plaster of Paris. Gypsum also has other industrial uses.

talc, common silicate mineral that is distinguished from almost all other minerals by its extreme softness (it has the lowest rating [1] on the Mohs scale of hardness). Its soapy or greasy feel accounts for the name soapstone given to compact aggregates of talc and other rock-forming minerals. Dense aggregates of high-purity talc are called steatite.

Pure gypsum is white, but other substances found as impurities may give a wide range of colors to local deposits. Because gypsum dissolves over time in water, gypsum is rarely found in the form of sand.

## Talc Mineral | Physical - Optical Properties, Occurrence, Uses
Talc Uses. Talc has many uses. In the making of paper, paint, plastic, electrik, food, medicine, cosmetics and ceramics. Due to its resistance to heat, electricity and acids, it is used on laboratory tabletop surfaces and surfaces of power plants. Talc is used as cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant and as a filler in paper production.

## What property can be used to distinguish talc and gypsum? [Solved] (2022)
The property that can be used to distinguish talc from gypsum is hardness. The hardness of a mineral is determined by how easily the mineral is scratched (or not). The scale for determining the hardness of minerals is the Mohs Hardness Scale.

The hardest mineral known, diamond, was assigned the number 10. How does the hardness scale work? The Mohs Hardness Scale ranks the order of hardness of minerals and some common objects. For example, your fingernail can scratch the minerals talc and gypsum, with a hardness of 2 or lower. A copper penny can scratch calcite, gypsum, and talc.

Gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2H 2 O), the most common of the sulphate minerals, is also known as alabaster (a fine-grained massive form), satin spar (a fibrous variety of gypsum), or selenite (colourless transparent gypsum crystals). Gypsum is often found in considerable thicknesses within evaporite sequences and in association with limestones

Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. According to the scale, Talc is the softest: it can be scratched by all other materials. Gypsum is harder: it can scratch talc but not calcite, which is even harder. The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms.

Description. The term talc refers both to the pure mineral and a wide variety of soft, talc-containing rocks that are mined and utilized for a variety of applications. Talc forms mica-like flakes. Talc is the softest mineral on the Mohs hardness scale at 1 and can be easily cut and crushed. Talc has perfect cleavage in one direction.

## Gypsum
Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O. It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard or sidewalk chalk, and drywall.A massive fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, has been used for sculpture by many cultures including

## Comparing and Contrasting Mineral Properties
For example, if you scratch the mineral with the knife and nothing happens, the specimen is likely quartz or feldspar. If your fingernail can scratch the mineral, it may be gypsum or less commonly talc. PROCEDURE: Use the Gem Placemats to help students discover the hardness of different gems, especially those gems that are minerals.

## Gypsum and Halite - University of Pittsburgh
Gypsum and Halite: Evaporite Minerals. Gypsum is readily identified by its softness (a fingernail scratches it). Gypsum comes as clear crystals that display one perfect cleavage (selenite), as blocks of featureless white rock (alabaster), and as silky fibrous blocks (satin spar). Halite (next page) breaks into cubes (three cleavages at right
