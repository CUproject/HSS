Bauxite is mined in various mines across Australia. There are two bauxite mines currently operating in Alcoa, Western Australia. These mines are the Huntly mine, located near Dwellingup and the Willowdale mine located east of Waroona. Mining and Extraction process of Aluminium Aluminium is mined on the surface of the crust.

## Bauxite Beneficiation Process India-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
Many bauxite reserves in India have Al2O3/SiO2 ratio of 4 to 6 and hence pose difficulties in production of alumina through the Bayer process. The extraction of alumina from bauxite in low temperature digestion circuit frequently involves a desilication step in which kaolinite dissolves and reprecipitates as sodalite, a caustic insoluble sodium alumino silicate.

## Bauxite: Definition, Formula, Types and Different Applications
Bauxite is a sedimentary rock, which contains relatively high levels of aluminium. It is the main source of aluminium and gallium. Bauxite appears dull in luster and is reddish-brown, white, or tan in color. The rock was discovered in 1821 by French geologist Pierre Berthier, near the village of Les Braux in Provence, southern France.

## Bauxite Mining Process In Australia Crusher
During the strip-mining process, bauxite is broken up and taken out of the mine to an alumina refinery. Once mining is complete, the topsoil is replaced and the area undergoes a restoration process. When the ore is mined in forested areas, an average of 80 percent of the land is returned to its native ecosystem. View Details Send Enquiry Mobile
