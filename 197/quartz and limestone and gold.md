Sandstone. An agglomerated stone, sandstone consists of sand held together by cement of a variable nature. Sandstone consists mainly of quartz grains, is resistant to compression, and has variable flexibility. Low to intermediate strength sandstone crumbles more easily while the higher strength sandstones are more strongly cemented.
