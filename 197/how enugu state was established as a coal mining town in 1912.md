## Enugu State: 5 Must See Sites In The Coal City State

## HISTORY OF ENUGU STATE | campaign
By 1958 Enugu had over 8,000 coal miners. As of 2005 there are no significant coal mining activities left in the city. Enugu became the capital of the Eastern Region after Nigeria's independence in 1960; a succession of territorial adjustments in 1967, 1976 and 1991 led to Enugu becoming the capital of what is now Enugu State.

## how enugu state was established as a coal mining town in 1912
Enugu State (Figure 1) was created on August 27, 1991 with the city of Enugu as its capital. The State derived its name from the capital city which was established in 1912 as a small coal mining town, but later grew to be capital of the former Eastern Region of Nigeria in 1967 when the Gowon administration created twelve states in Nigeria.
