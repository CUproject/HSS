## Concrete grinding, Practice of grinding, Health and safety - Flooring Tech
Concrete grinding produces silica dust. If the dust is breathed in over a period of time, it can lead to a disease called silicosis or scarring of the lungs. This was such a common problem for grinder operators in years past that one of its common names was 'grinder's asthma'.

## Concrete Grinding [A Complete Guide] - BW Manufacturing: Leaders in 
While diamond grinding is effective at leveling an uneven surface, it is not an efficient method for flattening a non-flat surface. If your concrete area features a crack or damaged section that is creating a protrusion or tripping hazard, the amount of grinding necessary to flatten the area will cost more in equipment and material costs, and likely result in unevenness in other areas as a result.

The advanced stage of polishing may require a polishing disk having finer grit - nearly 1800 to 3500 grits. To start with, use 1800 grits of polishing disk, turn the hose on and apply about 1/2-inch of water over a 5 foot of area. Now stop the water source. Run the concrete grinder over the wet area until the entire water dries out.
