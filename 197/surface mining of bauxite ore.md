## Employing precision surface mining at African bauxite mine 
The Boké Mine in Guinea, Africa, holds some of the world's highest-quality bauxite deposits. To efficiently extract, process and transport the material from the mine, located approximately 30 km (18.6 miles) from the northern shores of the Rio Nuñez in Boké Prefecture, the Société Minière de Boké mining company (SMB) was formed in 2014.

## Alcoa Bauxite Mine Near Bauxite, Arkansas | The Diggings™
Production output of the Alcoa Bauxite Mine was considered to be medium size. The ore mined is composed of bauxite with waste material consisting primarily of sphene, rutile and anatase. The ore body is described as tabular shaped 9 meters (29 feet) thick 18 meters (60 feet) below the surface. Associated rock in this area is nepheline syenite.

## Mining Greece Bauxite
Greece holds a very important place, not only in the European Union, but also at a global level, as it is one of the major bauxite producing countries. 90% of the mining of bauxite in our country takes place in underground exploitations and 10% in opencast ones. The measured amounts of bauxite in Greece amount to approximately 130,000,000 tons

Trains rest on tracks near Kamsar's port after completing their 120-km long journey from the mining area in Sangaredi. Five to seven trains, each equipped with 120 wagons, leave that mine every day. Each wagon contains around 82 tons of bauxite ore, amounting to between 49,200 and 68,800 tons of bauxite shipped, by railway alone, daily.

All the ores arc minerals but all minerals cannot be ores, e.g., both bauxite (Al 2 O 3.xH2O) and clay (Al 2 O 3.2SiO 2.2H 2 O) are minerals of aluminium . It is bauxite which is used for extraction of aluminium</b> and not clay.

Bauxite (Fig. 1.33) is formed by surface weathering of clay rocks around the tropical region and composer of aluminum oxide (Al (OH) 3). It contains 15%-25% aluminum and only ore used for commercial extraction for aluminum. The bauxite occurs as near-surface layers and usually mixed with clay minerals, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.
