## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

Apr 6, 2022Phosphate rock is a general term for phosphate minerals that can be used economically, and is an important chemical mineral raw material. It can be used to produce phosphate fertilizers, and can also be used to produce yellow phosphorus, phosphoric acid, phosphide and other phosphates, which are used in medicine, food, matches, dyes, sugar, ceramics, national defense and other industrial sectors.

## Ammaroo Phosphate Project, Northern Territory, Australia
The Ammaroo phosphate project is estimated to hold a total of 32.4Mt phosphate reserves grading 18.2% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5). It includes 11.8Mt of proven and 20.6Mt of probable reserves. In the first stage one, the project is expected to produce 1Mtpa phosphate for the initial five years of operation.

Dissolved CO2 was precipitated (first by chemical and then biological processes) to form the Earth's large deposits of sedimentary carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite, etc.). Because N2 is relatively inert, insoluble in water, and noncondensable, it accumulated to become the most abundant gas in the atmosphere.
