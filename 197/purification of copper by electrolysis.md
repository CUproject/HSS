## Electrowinning
Electrowinning is the oldest industrial electrolytic process. The English chemist Humphry Davy obtained sodium metal in elemental form for the first time in 1807 by the electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide.. Electrorefining of copper was first demonstrated experimentally by Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg in 1847.. James Elkington patented the commercial process in 1865 and opened the

## How can electrolysis be used to purify copper? | Socratic
Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode, leaving the impurities behind. Unrefined copper is about 99 % pure. It contains traces of metals such as Fe, Zn, Ag, Au, and Pt. The purity can be increased to 99.95 % by electrolytic refining in a cell similar to that shown below. A thin sheet of high-purity Cu serves as the cathode.

Electrolytic refining is a process of refining a metal (mainly copper) by the process of electrolysis. As far as the mechanism of the process is concerned, during electrolysis, a large chunk or slab of impure metal is used as the anode with a thin strip of pure metal at the cathode. In this setup, an electrolyte (metal salt aqueous solution

## During the purification of copper by electrolysis?
Why is electrolysis used in the extraction of copper? Copper is well below carbon (less reactive) and so can be displaced by carbon from its compounds eg copper oxides or sulfides.  Electrolysis to copper pipes can happen when stray direct current (DC) electricity causes the copper to break down or disintegrate. Metals that are different
