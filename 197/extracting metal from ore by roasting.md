## Chemistry - Clarity On The Extraction Of Moderately Reactive Metals
With the help of reducing agents like calcium, sodium, aluminium, or carbon, the metal oxide which is created due to calcination or roasting of the ores needs to be converted into free metals. The level of chemical reactivity of that specific metal that needs extraction is used to determine which reducing agent is going to be used.

## Which type of principals are involved in extraction of the element 
May 30, 2022The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance.  Roasting includes heating of ore lower than its melting point in the presence of oxygen or air. Is coal tar used in metal extraction? Like charcoal, it Is a good fuel and burns without smoke.

Roasting: Zinc blende is subjected to roasting, i.e. it is heated in the presence of excess air. This converts zinc sulphide ore to zinc oxide. The reaction involved is: Reduction: Zinc oxide is then reduced by coke (carbon). When zinc oxide is heated with coke, carbon acts as a reducing agent and reduces zinc oxide to zinc metal.
