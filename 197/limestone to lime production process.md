Description: The term "hydrated lime" is widely used to describe a powdered calcium hydroxide product made by reacting quicklime with a controlled excess of water. The product is essentially dry and generally contains less than 1% of un-reacted water. The process is called "hydration" and should be differentiated from "slaking

Lime. throughout history. Nobody knows exactly when humans first discovered lime. Perhaps ancient occupants of Earth used limestone rock to protect their fireplaces. Fire heated the rocks and the first burnt lime was created. It then rained and the lime slaked into calcium hydroxide, which reacted with the ashes and sand around the fireplace

##  How to Calculate Efficiency of Your Lime Burning Process
LIME BURNING PROCESS Introduction The practice of burning limestone to produce quicklime is, almost literally, as old as the hills. In terms of basic chemistry and materials, the process involves the conversion of calcium carbonate, CaCO 3, to the more useful calcium oxide, CaO. Calcium oxide is a very reactive substance.

Lime is a calcium-containing inorganic material composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO.

After the heating (or "calcinating") process, the lime can be milled again and then hydrated or "slaked.". Union Process has developed and patented an

## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes | Graymont
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.
