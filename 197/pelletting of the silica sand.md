The silica bearing sandstone must be mined or quarried much in the manner for handling hard rock. The mined ore is reduced by a Jaw Crusher to about 1â€³ size for the average small tonnage operation. For larger scale operations two-stage crushing is advisable. The crushed ore is reduced to natural sand grain size by Rod Milling.

## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170Â°C (340Â°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.
