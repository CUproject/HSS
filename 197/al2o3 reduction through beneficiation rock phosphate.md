For effective beneficiation of phosphate rock, a surface conditioner must be added to the slurry prior to agglomeration. Effective surface conditioners include oleic acid, fatty acids, and high molecular weight organic acids. These surface conditioners activate the surface of the phosphates.

## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

## Beneficiation of apatite rock phosphates by calcination: effects on 
Some RPs are calcined during beneficiation to remove impurities, to increase P concentration, or to make Fe- and Al-phosphate impurities more available to plants (Milnes 1976). These RPs may also be used as direct application fertilisers but the effect of calcination on the agronomic effectiveness is likely to be adverse (Khasawneh et al. 1980).

The Ni2P phase was obtained by temperature-programmed reduction of a phosphate precursor with a P/Ni ratio as low as 1.2 supported over both AB0.3 (Ni-P(1.2)/AB0.3) and B2O3-Al2O3 (Ni-P(1.2)/B2O3-Al2O3). This suggests that the surface B2O3 inhibits the reaction between nickel phosphates and Al2O3, and thus facilitates the formation of Ni2P.

Phosphate rock is mined by both surface (open-cast, open-pit or strip mining) and underground methods. The surface mining can take many forms — from manual methods employing picks and shovels to highly mechanized operations. Surface mining is the most utilized method by far for mining phosphate deposits.
