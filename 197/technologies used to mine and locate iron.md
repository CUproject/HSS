## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

Yes, historical research is a great thing. IF you live somewhere considered important enough to write about, that is. One of the best sources for finding old iron-related sites is J.P. Leslie's Guide to the Furnaces, Foundries, and Rolling Mills of the United States printed in 1859. However, it's only good for what was the U.S. in 1859, and for places therein that had been developed by 1859.

WHERE IS IRON ORE MINED? - DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY. Iron ore can be found all over the world, in the form of rocks and other minerals. To be economically viable for mining, iron ore must contain at least 20% iron. Magnetite ore has the highest proportion of iron, at 65%. Haematite ore also has a high content of iron at 60%.
