In using this test procedure, you are assuming concrete has a significant plastic strain range. It does not. In compression, it truly acts as an elastic material, but you are likely to get multi-axial stress increases that will fail the sample prior to the onset of localized crushing, usually in a shear or shear-tension mode.

The strength of concrete is generally measured by testing concrete cubes which are prepared from the concrete used in that particular construction. The cube strength of concrete is speciﬁ ed by a structural engineer and is assessed by crushing concrete cubes at a speciﬁ ed age (28 days after casting). Early strength may also be assessed

## Compressive Strength of Concrete -Cube Test, Procedure, Results
Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures. Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc

## Cubes Be Gone: Why Cubes Shouldn't Be Used To Measure  - Medium
The traditional method of assessing the compressive strength of concrete on-site is through collecting sample cubes, and sending them to a lab to be tested.  Predetermined crush dates make schedules incredibly inflexible. Assuming crush dates are scheduled every 7 days, if, for example, your cube reaches strength on day 8, the test will show
