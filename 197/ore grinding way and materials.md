1.3 Run-Of-Mine Material and Minerals. Generally, mineral processing begins when an ore is delivered from a mine, to a processing facility. At this point, the ore is called run-of-mine material because there has been no treatment performed on it. There are three primary types of run-of-mine materials: Run-of-mine consisting of useful materials.

## Factors Influence Ore Grinding Mill Efficiency - JXSC Mining
By the way, the larger the diameter of the ball mill, the lower the filling rate. For the rod mill, the filling rate is generally 10% lower than that of the ball mill of the same specification. 2.2 Diameter of steel grinding ball. The grinding efficiency is reflected in the processing capacity of the mill and the fineness of the grinding ore.

## ore grinding way and materials
ore grinding way and materials. Mineral processing Wikipedia. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "runofmine" ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material.
