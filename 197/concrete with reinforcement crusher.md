Dec 21, 2020The exposure classes defines the required concrete cover, which is normally the minimum cover plus a margin for any deviation when on site. Reinforced concrete develops microscopic cracks when loaded, which can widen depending on the applied loads. Designers set a minimum crack width which is generally 0.3mm.

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
It's recycling! Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.
