## New Zealand's Top Trading Partners 2021 - World's Top Exports
by Flagpictures An island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean located to the southeast of Australia, New Zealand shipped US$43.3 billion worth of goods around the globe in 2021. That dollar amount reflects a 17.1% gain since 2017 and a 15.7% upturn from 2020 to 2021. That figure represents roughly 0.2% of overall global exports estimated at $17.503 trillion one year earlier during 2020.
