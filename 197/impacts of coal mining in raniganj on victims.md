## Assessing subsidence susceptibility to coal mining using frequency 
Few studies have been conducted on subsidence in Raniganj coalfield. Singh and Yadav used generalized coal model to examine subsidence in Ratibati and Shivadanga coal mines in Raniganj and Sadhu et al. examined the impact of coal mines on the surrounding soil quality. Coal has been extracted in this region using surface (opencast) and

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Coal Mining. Health effects from coal mining include: the release of methane (CH 4), a potent greenhouse gas estimated to account for 18% of the overall global warming effect triggered by human activities (CO 2 is estimated to contribute 50%).; the release of carbon monoxide (CO) from explosives, which pollutes the air and poses a health risk for mine workers.

175 are open cast mines and 227 are underground mines (Coal Dictionary of India ) but total production of coal from existing mines is quite opposite in nature. 92.91% of coal comes from open cast mines and only 7.09% from underground mines (Annual Reports and Accounts of CIL ). Hence, the massive pressure on open cast

Coal mining is usually associated with the degradation of natural resources and the destruction of habitat. This causes invasive species to occupy the area, thus posing a threat to biodiversity. Huge quantities of waste material are produced by several mining activities in the coal mining region.
