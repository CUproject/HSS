## What do coffee dry mills do? - The Coffee Blog
Dry mills need to channel coffee lots not only by their physical appearance but by sensory attributes and profiles as well. To do it, all existing lots are cupped and corresponding sensory profiles are described and logged. Based on the results, coffee lots are separated, combined or blended; or used to identify defects and processing problems.
