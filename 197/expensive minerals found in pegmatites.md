## Pegmatite - Igneous Rocks - Sandatlas
This wealth of minerals makes pegmatites often valuable as a mineral resource. Pegmatites may be mined because of their high content of feldspars, clay (if weathered), mica, or many metal-bearing minerals. Pegmatite is also a source of gems like beryl, tourmaline, zircon, etc. Most pegmatites are granites with or without exotic minerals, but

Abstract. Uranium and rare-earth minerals are common accessory minerals in pegmatite deposits. No domestic pegmatites have been found that are rich enough to support an economic mining operation for uranium alone; however, small quantities of uranium minerals may be recovered as by-products of feldspar or mica mining.

Rare minerals from pegmatites. Part of Hall of Planet Earth. As molten granite crystallizes, the melt that remains becomes enriched in water and rare elements such as boron, lithium, tantalum, and niobium. These elements concentrate in the melt because they are not taken up by the minerals crystallizing from it.

Pegmatites are exceptionally coarse-grained igneous rocks [3] composed of interlocking crystals, with individual crystals usually over 1 centimeter (0.4 in) in size and sometimes exceeding 1 meter (3 ft). [4] Most pegmatites have a composition similar to granite, so that their most common minerals are quartz, feldspar, and mica.

## Pegmatite: Take a Look at What's Inside - Advancing Mining
In the early stages of crystallization, the ions that form high-temperature minerals are depleted from the melt. Rare ions that do not participate in the crystallization of common rock-forming minerals become concentrated in the melt and in the excluded water. These ions can form the rare minerals that are often found in pegmatites.

Typically, all of these minerals are found within miarolitic cavities (gem-bearing pockets) in the core of pegmatitic body. The most distinguishing feature of pegmatites is the presence of extremely large sized crystals (e.g. gem-quality beryl measuring 55 x 18 x 16 cm in size and weighting 22 kg was extracted from Volyn pegmatite field, Ukraine).

## Pegmatite: An Intrusive Igneous Rock - ThoughtCo
Pegmatite is an extremely coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed of large interlocking crystals. There is no defined mineralogy for pegmatite; any plutonic rock may form pegmatite. The most common type of pegmatite is made of granite. Granite pegmatite typically contains feldspar, mica, and quartz. Pegmatite is an economically-important

## About pegmatites
Pegmatites consist of minerals which are found also in the rocks from which they are derived, e.g. granite-pegmatites contain principally quartz and feldspar while gabbro-pegmatites consist of diallage and plagioclase. Rare minerals, however, often occur in these veins in exceptional amount and as very perfect crystals.

##  Evaluating Muscovite as an indicator mineral for lithium bearing 
Portable Raman spectroscopy was able to positively identify muscovite, and other mineral commonly found in pegmatites such as muscovite, albite, K-feldspars, spodumene, petalite and amblygonite. However, the portable Raman was not able to identify any significant peak changes relating to the variations in Li content.

minerals are demonstrated. Introduction Pegmatites are suppliers of rare metals like beryllium, lithium and tantalum. Pegmatites also represent an important source of gem-stones such as emerald and tourmaline, and some pegmatites are even mined for their large, clean crystals of quartz and feldspar. Pegmatites are abundant in Greenland, but
