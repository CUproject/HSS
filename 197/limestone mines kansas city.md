Another space adjustment technique, too long ignored, is the use of the subsurface area beneath the city. Secondary use of mined-out space in underground limestone quarries 50-200 feet below the surface has emerged in Kansas City where for twenty-five years abandoned deep mine sites have been renovated into warehouses, factories, and offices.
