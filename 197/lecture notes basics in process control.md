##  Instrumentation & Process Control
A typical example of a PID control loop that everyone can understand is cruise control. • Gas pedal says where it needs to be on a flat surface. • When you start to go up a hill the gas pedal goes down to maintain the speed set point. • When you start to go down hill the gas pedal backs off to try and maintain the speed set point.

Process models are central to the analysis and design of feedback control systems. Process control systems can often seem complicated, since they contain a relatively large number of different parts. These parts may represent many different branches of technology, e.g., chemistry, biology, electronics, pneumatics, and hydraulics. To work
