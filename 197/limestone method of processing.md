## limestone method of processing
 · 11.17.1 Process Description 1-5 Lime is the high-temperature product of the calcination of limestone. Although limestone deposits are found in every state, only a small portion is pure enough for industrial lime manufacturing. To be classified as limestone, the rock must contain at least 50 percent calcium carbonate.

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

## Limestone Processing - national rocks
Processing involves a series of crushing and screening stages designed to produce material with a specified range of sizes. The primary crusher first roughly crushes material; secondary crushers then reduce the rock size and produce the final size and shape of limestone products after screening. The Flow chart of the processing plant is shown below
