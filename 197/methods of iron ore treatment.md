## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

2.1 Iron Ore Composition Iron very rarely occurs in the earth's surface as a metal. It is widely distributed, combined with oxygen as iron oxides. In fact it is believed that iron makes up about 5% by weight of the earth's crust. Geologists recognise various types of iron ore, classified chiefly according to iron (Fe) content (see Table 1 below).

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.
