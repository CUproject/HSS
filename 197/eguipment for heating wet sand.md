## Wet Processing Equipment: The Pros and Cons - Quarry
The simplest form of wet sand processing is the removal of fines from a typical -5mm natural/alluvial or manufactured (crushed) sand fraction, followed by the dewatering of the washed product for stockpiling and transport purposes (fines permissible in construction sands commonly ranging from zero to 15 per cent passing 63 microns).

## How long after painting to wet sand and polish?
Quote from: Xnavylfr on March 21, 2012, 01:20:12 pm. If you have some heat lamps, place them about 6' from the tanks and fender,let it sit under the heat for 12 hours!! This will bake in the paint and make it hard enough to finish sand. Remember paint dries from the outside in and it could feel dry but still wet under neath!

With your sand heated to 125°F, you no longer need to superheat water. Still, however, Steam Engineering technology allows you to heat water to 140°F very efficiently, at a rate of 1,200

## Acrylic Sheet Edge and Surface Finishing
Wet sanding is desired for finishing acrylics. Normally grit "wet or dry" paper is used along with plenty of water. If done by hand, use a sanding block to keep the edges even. Only light pressure should be applied when grinding with power sanders to minimize frictional heat which can cause gumming from over-heating of the acrylic.

##  SINGLE-STAGE URETHANE PAINT - Eastwood
POLISH When used as a Single-Stage Urethane Paint, this coating may be wet-sanded and polished for increased depth and gloss like any other urethane topcoat. Care should be taken when cutting metallic colors to avoid disturbing aluminum ﬂ ake. Start by sanding the ﬁ nish with 1500 grit to abrade the surface and remove any slight imperfections.

## Wet sanding-kemna
Wet sanding paint is done with very high grade, fine sandpaper such as 1000, 2000, and 3000 grit. Here is a picture of a panel that has been wet sanded, but not polished: The white residue is the sanded clear coat, underneath that is a matte finish because the polish has not yet been applied to bring back that glossy finish.
