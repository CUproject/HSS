## Jaw Crusher | manufactor | thyssenkrupp Mining Technologies
Single-toggle jaw crushers. Single-toggle jaw crushers are ideal for maximum throughput rates when crushing medium-hard and hard materials. They are characterized by the swing jaw being suspended directly on the eccentric drive shaft and the lower part of the swing jaw being braced against the crusher frame by means of a toggle plate.

## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of the crusher, while the other is an eccentric shaft that drives both toggle plates. The moving jaw has a pure reciprocating motion toward the fixed jaw. The crushing force is doubled compared to single toggle crushers and it can crush very hard ores. The jaw crusher is reliable and robust and

##  Nordberg C series jaw crushers Wear parts application guide
In crushers like C105 and C3055, the jaw die design on the ends is different. The lock-ing wedges on these crushers are located behind the jaw dies rather than at the top of the jaw die. Jaw dies can be allowed to wear until the thickness is 60 to 65 mm thick, or the teeth are worn flat. On other crushers the ends of the jaw dies are much thinner.

In crushers like C105 and C3055, the jaw die design on the ends is different. The lock-ing wedges on these crushers are located behind the jaw dies rather than at the top of the jaw die. Jaw dies can be allowed to wear until the thickness is 60 to 65 mm thick, or the teeth are worn flat. On other crushers the ends of the jaw dies are much thinner.

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
The Jaw Crusher was first introduced by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858 as a double-toggle Jaw Crusher. Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first modern era overhead eccentric Jaw Crushers. On the overhead eccentric style Jaw Crusher, the moving swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft with heavy-duty double

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Characteristics and Comparison of Four Types of Jaw Crushers
Oct 28, 2021The eccentric shaft and all jaw crushers of any style have some sort of eccentric motion. As the eccentric rotates it pushed down on the pitman which in turn flattens the angle between the two toggles since the rear toggle is pivoting against the frame, the front toggle pushes on the swing jaw closing the gap between the two jaw plates.
