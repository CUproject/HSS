Bentonite is the most commonly employed binder in the iron ore pelletizing, or "balling" process used in the production of steel. The importance of iron ore pelletizing has been on the rise in recent years as high-grade sources of iron ore diminish, buyer preferences change, and producers look to operate more sustainably.

##  --sulphur-----bentoniterotoform------ rotoform  - Ipco
By linking the Rotoform solidification process to upstream dosing and mixing plant, we can deliver a fully automated continuous process for the production of sulphur bentonite fertilizer. As the diagram below shows, plant productivity is maximized by using two mixing vessels: one mixing while the other feeds the Rotoform system. Water
