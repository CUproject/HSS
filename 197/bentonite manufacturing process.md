##  --sulphur-----bentoniterotoform------ rotoform  - Ipco
By linking the Rotoform solidification process to upstream dosing and mixing plant, we can deliver a fully automated continuous process for the production of sulphur bentonite fertilizer. As the diagram below shows, plant productivity is maximized by using two mixing vessels: one mixing while the other feeds the Rotoform system. Water
