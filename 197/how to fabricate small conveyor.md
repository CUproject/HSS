## New Ways of Handling Small Parts - Dorner Conveyors
To build a miniature conveyor, end rollers have been reduced to 5/8". This profile enables it to fit into tight spaces within a machine, but also when positioned together end-to-end, can successful transfer products as small as 7/8" in diameter. The bearing housings are fully encapsulated within the conveyor frame.

The conveyor had to have a specific height to reach the hopper, in this case a little over 9 feet. There also had to be a short flat section at the bottom to catch the product as it was "scraped" off of a cooling table. Since I had decided to build the cooling table and cart myself I also decided to build the conveyor.

This little conveyor is an "elevator" or "ZX" conveyor used to carry small parts up from under a machine, count them and then dump at a higher height. This "up and over" conveyor design has a unique frame where the belting rides inside the frame in order to not create a sagging under- belt. The unit counts the items as they pass or can be indexed with your machine.

Jan 12, 2022Conveyors are widely used to move quantities of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. They are often the most cost-effective means of safely transporting large volumes of product, and they lend themselves to automated operation. There are two material handling subcategories in belt conveyors: unit handling and bulk handling.

## Small conveyor systems for more output - KRUPS Automation
Small conveyor systems for more output Optimal handling of small parts in your process chain. In a wide variety of industries, wherever mainly smaller products are produced, processed, packaged or stored, the daily flow of parts must be conveyed as efficiently as possible so that the entire process chain ensures fast and cost-effective output.

## Can't Build Conveyors? :: Space Engineers General Discussions
Go into you inventory and click the "Progression" button to see what blocks needs to be build to unlock the conveyor. Thanks! #2. Aldan Feb 2, 2020 @ 9:21am. Basically as I know this conveyors exists past the build of cargo containers. And making a cheap small block cargo container like the ones you see on unknown signals will unlock conveyors.
