Bauxite ore is the world's primary source of aluminum. The ore must first be chemically processed to produce alumina (aluminum oxide). Alumina is then smelted using an electrolysis process to produce pure aluminum metal. Bauxite is typically found in topsoil located in various tropical and subtropical regions.

Hydrometallurgical processing of black shale (Quseir-Safaga region) is attained through leaching with sulphuric acid under oxygen pressure (atmospheric leaching leads to complete dissolution of both vanadium and iron). Separation of iron from vanadium is very difficult, due to the narrow pH precipitation range of the two metals (pH 2-3).

The extraction of aluminium involves two steps that is, purification of bauxite by Baeyer's process and electrolysis of alumina. 1. Purification of bauxite by Baeyer's process In the Baeyer's process, the bauxite ore is heated with concentrated NaOH solution under pressure (Aluminum is purified by leaching method).The alumina dissolves as sodium meta aluminate.

## Table 2 from HYDROMETALLURGICAL PROCESSING OF EGYPTIAN BAUXITE 
Hydrometallurgical processing of the beneficiated gibbsitic bauxite was performed by hot leaching with sodium carbonate and lime in an attritor. Aluminium was converted to soluble sodium aluminate low in SiO2 (<0.1%) and the recovery was over 95% for a short leaching duration of 30.
