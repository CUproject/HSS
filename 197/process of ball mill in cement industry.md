## Ball Mills - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
CERAMIC LINED BALL MILL. Ball Mills can be supplied with either ceramic or rubber linings for wet or dry grinding, for continuous or batch type operation, in sizes from 15″ x 21″ to 8′ x 12′. High density ceramic linings of uniform hardness male possible thinner linings and greater and more effective grinding volume.

## Difference Between Cement Vertical Mill and Ball Mill
The vertical mill adopts full negative pressure operation, with small dust, clean consumption and no dust pollution, while the ball mill is open, large dust, and great environmental pollution. Many examples show that in terms of energy saving and emission reduction, the advantages of the new cement vertical mill are far greater than ball mills

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

Material is directly conveyed to the silos (silos are the large storage tanks of cement) from the grinding mills. Further, it is packed to about 20-40 kg bags. Only a small percent of cement is packed in the bags only for those customers whom need is very small. The remaining cement is shipped in bulk quantities by mean of trucks, rails or ships.

The equation below shows the relationship between ball mill grinding efficiency and material fineness: Kd = G2/G1 = (d1/d2) X (1) Note. Kd: the relative productivity of the mill; G1 & G2: respectively represent the mill output (T / h) when the feed particle size is d1 and d2; X: the index, which is related to material characteristics, product
