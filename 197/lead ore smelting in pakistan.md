The smelting of nickel sulfide concentrates is similar to that of copper sulfide concentrates, except that the converting step in this case produces high-grade, low-iron matte for further treatment, rather than crude nickel metal. The smelting of lead sulfide (galena) concentrate is somewhat different in that lead sulfide is easily oxidized to PbO.

## Smelting
Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy; its main use is to produce a metal from its ore. This includes iron extraction from iron ore, and copper extraction and other base metals from their ores. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to change the oxidation state of the metal ore; the reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon

## Slag - Ore Smelting
The smelting of copper and lead in non-ferrous smelting, for instance, is designed to remove the iron and silica that often occurs with those ores, and separates them as iron-silicate-based slags. Slag from steel mills in ferrous smelting, on the other hand, is designed to minimize iron loss and so mainly contains oxides of calcium, silicon
