## Depletion-induced Hazards and Risks and Their Management
Increase in sand production is another potential side effect of stress change induced by depletion. Sand production can influence the economics of the field. The figure below shows large amount of sand production in an oil field in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela which experienced huge subsidence during production (Vasquez at al., 1999).

The effects of potassium depletion on cell adhesion were reversible. Within 1 h after switching K +-depleted fibroblasts to medium containing KCl, cells developed a polarized morphology with actin stress fibers inserting into focal adhesion plaques. Coated pits also reformed on the cell surface during this time.
