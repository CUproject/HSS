## Classification and working principle of screw conveyor | RICHI
1. The definition of screw conveyor. The screw conveyor is commonly known as the auger, and the screw conveyor uses the rotating screw blade to push the material for the screw conveyor. The force that the material does not rotate with the screw conveyor blades is the material's own weight and the frictional resistance of the screw conveyor

The screw calculation uses the Secant method to calculate the stress at the edge fiber profile. This method also allows you to address cases when the force does not act exactly along the axis of the screw (imperfections of the bearing mount), or when the screw is not perfectly straight (manufacturing inaccuracies, deflection).

##  Binomial and Poisson Distributions - LNJPIT, Chapra
P)= 1( 𝑡−1). 2 ( 𝑡−1 )= ( 1+ 2) 𝑡−1. which is the m.g.f. of the Poisson variate X with mean ã1+ ã2 Hence x is a Poisson variate with mean ã1+ ã2 Corollary: Show that the difference of two independent Poisson variates is not a Poisson variate. Proof: Self Poisson Distribution as a limiting case of Binomial Distribution:
