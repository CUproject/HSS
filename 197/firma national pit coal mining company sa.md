## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
