Pellets: the process of pelletization enables converting Iron Ore Fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets" that can be charged into the blast furnaces or for Production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). Pellets are uniform size, with purity of 63%- 65% contributing to faster reduction and high metallization rates.
