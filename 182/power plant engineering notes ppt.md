## Gas Turbine Power Plant: Operation, Layout and Merits
The drawbacks of gas turbine power plants over steam power plants are: 1. The operating costs of gas turbine power plants are much higher than those of a steam power plant. 2. Gas turbines can be employed only in small sizes (about 50 MW or so). 3. Like steam turbines, the gas turbine is not readily reversible.
