For small and medium-sized cone crushers, the maximum distance from the feeding equipment to the top of the crusher is about 0.9 meters. If the feeding distance is too large, the stone will easily impact the crushing cavity at high speed, causing impact load on the equipment, resulting in additional maintenance costs and low output.
