According to the characteristics of raw ore, the use of stage grinding is an effective measure for energy saving in iron ore plants in China. The permanent magnet large-diameter magnetic separator can effectively separate 0-3mm coarse-grained iron ore with a trailing yield of 30-50% and a tailings grade of 8% or less.

## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device, often a structure, machine or kitchen appliance, that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g., via a hand crank), working

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Iron Ore Pelletization - FEECO International Inc.
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized - a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

## Investigation on Iron Ore Grinding based on Particle Size Distribution 
The feed samples of X, Y, and Z iron ores were ground in the BBM (ball mill refers to a BBM of size 300 mm × 300 mm with smooth liners) to identify the PSD, BWI, and RT of each ore. Grinding experiments were conducted according to Bond's standard test procedure [].For each iron ore sample, the RT taken to produce 250% circulating load in the BBM was measured by a new method.
