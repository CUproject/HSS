## Granite Quarry, NC > Community > About Granite Quarry
Granite Quarry was originally named Woodville in the late 1800's and was officially changed by the N.C. General Assembly to Woodsides on March 7, 1901. This name was derived from a family of Woodsides who lived in the community. The first post office was established under this name in 1891 with Joseph F. Wiley serving as the first postmaster.
