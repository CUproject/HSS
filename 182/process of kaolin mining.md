## Valorisation of a kaolin mining waste for the  - ScienceDirect
The kaolin mining waste (KW) is a residue generated during the purification process of extracting high purity kaolin used in different industries. KW is mainly constituted by kaolinite-rich clay and other secondary minerals such as anatase and quartz. With the appropriated and controlled process, calcined kaolin mining waste (CKW).

Kaolin is often mined many miles away from the processing plant, making the movement of this mineral through pipelines costly in energy and throughput. As with most mining applications, a large part of the processing water used is recycled water, thus requiring that a certain quality of water be obtained prior to reusing.

## Top 12 Kaolin Exporting Countries - WorldAtlas
The Kaolin Exporting Process  If the area is considered an acceptable site for kaolin mining, then the layers of ground above the kaolin is removed and extracted using front-end loaders, backhoes, and other heavy machinery. This method that is called open pit method. Sometimes it is extracted using hydraulic mining and dredging.
