## What are Construction Crushers? How Construction Crusher Works?
The crushing mechanism holds the material to be crushed between solid surfaces. A force is applied that brings the surfaces close to each other. Energy is generated within the materials to be crushed, and cause the separation of the molecules. The ancient crushers were stones held by hands. The stone weight enhanced the human energy being used.
