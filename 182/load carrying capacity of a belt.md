This section on top of the trapezoid can be described with a circle and the angle this circle makes with the belt

Jun 3, 2022Load Carrying Capacity Of A Belt Know More. Guide to VBelt Selection and Replacement Power, As another example, replacing an older, classical Vbelt drive with a newer, narrow profile notched Vbelt made with an ethylene elastomer and aramid fiber tensile cords can yield up to 3x greater load carrying capacity while reducing the weight and size of the drive, relieving stress on shafts .

## Load Carrying Capacity | Gear Technology Magazine
Feb 23, 2022The common calculation methods according to DIN 3990 and ISO 6336 are based on a comparison of occurring stress and allowable stress. The influence of gear size on the load-carrying capacity is considered with the size factors YX (tooth root bending) and ZX (pitting), but there are further influences, which should be considered.
