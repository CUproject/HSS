## Isolation of Aquatic Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria for the Floating 
Aug 3, 2022The utilization of PGPB (also known as biofertilizers) has been suggested as an "eco-friendly" alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Duckweeds are tiny floating plants that have attracted attention due to their starch-rich biomass, high-protein contents [7,8], and high yields of biofuels (e.g., bio-ethanol [9,10]).

## Floating LNG Plant Technology｜CHIYODA CORPORATION
A floating LNG (FLNG) is an LNG plant constructed on a ship or a barge which has LNG storage and offloading facilities. The FLNG accomplishes the gas treatment and liquefaction (production of LNG) from the natural gases produced in offshore gas fields, and the storage/offloading of product LNG to LNG carriers for ocean transportation.

## 21 Beautiful Floating Aquarium Plants And Care Guide - Life Of Fish
Sep 13, 2021Floating plants help prevent algae by absorbing excess nutrients like Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate and providing shade to the aquarium. Algae require both light and nutrients to thrive in an aquarium. Floating aquarium plants cut off these requirements; hence aquariums with floating plants do not usually get affected by algae blooms.
