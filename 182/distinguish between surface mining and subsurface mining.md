## What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Subsurface Mining 
What are some advantages of subsurface mining compared to surface mining quizlet? Subsurface mining offers more employment opportunities than surface mining would for the same volume of coal. Subsurface mining has less impact on the surrounding landscape than surface mining.. Coal companies have lower payroll costs because they need fewer miners.

Minerals Extracted. Surface mining is commonly used to extract coal and copper, and increasingly, precious metals like gold. Underground mining is used for gold, platinum, zinc, lead, and increasingly, coal. As can be seen, surface mining is much more advantageous than its counterpart.
