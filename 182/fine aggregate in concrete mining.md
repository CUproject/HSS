## Sand: The Fine Aggregate | SpringerLink
That portion of an aggregate passing the 4.75 mm sieve and predominantly retained on the 75 µm sieve is called "fine aggregate" or "sand," and larger aggregate is called "coarse aggregate". Coarse aggregate may be available in several different size groups, such as 4.7-19 mm, or 19-37.5 mm. Fine aggregates generally consist of

Fine aggregate is basically any normal sand particle that comes from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4″ or smaller. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4″ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. Fine Aggregate.

Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.

The fine particles attached on the surface of the recycled concrete aggregate increased the water absorption capacity of recycled fine aggregate and also had a lower density than natural aggregate [4,5,9]. Thus, the compressive strength was less than the conventional concrete due to the high water absorption capacity of the recycled fine aggregate.

## Performance of Recycled Fine-Aggregate Concrete Using Novel Mix 
The result shows that the developed mix design uses lesser quantities of cement and fine aggregates. Replacement of about 30% river sand (RS) by RFA was found optimum. The increase in compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity at 56 days was by 11.0%, 9.7%, 3.8%, and 4.0%, respectively.
