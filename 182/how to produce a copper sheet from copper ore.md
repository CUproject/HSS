Copper Process Flowsheet Example. A simplified schematic drawing of copper flotation flowsheet. Run-of-mine open pit ore will be crushed in a gyratory crusher. The crushed ore will be processed by means of semi-autogenous and ball mill grinding followed by rougher flotation, regrind, cleaner flotation, and dewatering to produce copper concentrate.

Smelting is a process involving several chemical reactions that are used to remove sulfur and iron from the copper. Placed into a furnace, the copper concentrate mixes with a flux melt and collects at the bottom of the hot furnace. Most of the other metals including iron become highly concentrated forming a slag, which is removed by skimming it

Once the ore is removed from the ground, it goes through processing in order to remove the other products, using elements such as oxygen, iron, silica and sulfuric acid. Copper is usually found in pit mining operations. Copper is generally close to the surface, so most copper mines use open pit techniques to remove the copper from the ground.
