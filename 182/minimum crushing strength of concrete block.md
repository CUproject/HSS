Calculation. Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load / Cross Sectional Area. Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 150mm = 22500 mm2 or 225 cm2. Assume the compression load is 450 KN, Compressive Strength = (450000 N / 225)/9.81 = 204 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N.

Properties of Concrete Blocks — Strength. It is probably safe to assume that the minimum crushing strength of well-made blocks, 1 to 5, is 1,000 pounds per square inch at 1 month and 2,000 pounds at 1 year. A block 12 inches wide and 24 inches long has a total surface of 288 square inches, or, deducting ⅓ for openings, a net area of 192 inches.

The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete Block: Everything You Should Know
Jun 12, 2022For concrete blocks, the compressive strength is typically around 17.5 N/mm2 or 2500 psi. This means that the blocks can support a load of up to 17.5 N per square millimeter before they start to crack. Compressive strength is tested to determine how much compression a concrete block structure can endure.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete -Cube Test, Procedure, Results
Minimum three specimens should be tested at each selected age. If the strength of any specimen varies by more than 15 percent of average strength, the results of such specimens should be rejected. The average of three specimens gives the crushing strength of concrete. The strength requirements of concrete. Calculations of Compressive Strength
