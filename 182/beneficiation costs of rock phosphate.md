Phosphorus is common within geological materials. The average continental crust contains 0.27% P 2 O 5. 1 Phosphorus is the primary resources to produce fertilizer and phosphorous-based products. 2 Phosphorus is neither substitutable nor recyclable, therefore, the total demand must be provided through the mining, beneficiation and chemical processing of phosphate ores.

## Beneficiation of apatite rock phosphates by calcination: effects on 
Some RPs are calcined during beneficiation to remove impurities, to increase P concentration, or to make Fe- and Al-phosphate impurities more available to plants (Milnes 1976). These RPs may also be used as direct application fertilisers but the effect of calcination on the agronomic effectiveness is likely to be adverse (Khasawneh et al. 1980).

May 30, 2022In phosphate rock beneficiation, the availability of water is of primary importance and may determine the process or processes used. Fine-grained impurities can often be removed from phosphate ores by using the combinations of comminution, scrubbing, water washing, screening and/or hydrocyclones.
