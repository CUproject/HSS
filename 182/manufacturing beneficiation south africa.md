##  The Catalytic Converter Industry in South Africa - Saimm
South Africa alone beneficiated 15 per cent of locally mined PGMs (approximately 37 t) in the production of catalytic converters - all is converted from PGM sponge (powdered metal) into PGM solutions for coating onto catalysts. Beneficiation of PGMs in the production of jewellery and electronic goods is negligible compared to catalytic converters.

The beneficiation strategy is aimed at providing a strategic focus for South Africa's minerals
