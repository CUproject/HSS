The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.
