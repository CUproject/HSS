## Stamp Mill Guide | Learn About This Device
A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.

## The Single Most Important Tool Used in the Gold Mines
A stamp is a metal that is moved up and down by a battering arm, pulverizing ores that are fed into it. They were mechanically operated machines that were used to crush ores by pounding till they extract the desired ore. Gold pans and sluice boxes were necessary tools for the placer miner, but they were of little use in the large mines.
