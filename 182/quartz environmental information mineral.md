Various types of clasts are shown in Figure 5.12 and in Exercise 5.3. The smaller ones tend to be composed of a single mineral crystal, and the larger ones are typically composed of pieces of rock.

Clay minerals have a wide range of particle sizes from 10's of angstroms to millimeters. (An angstrom is a unit of measure at the scale of atoms.) Thus, clays may be composed of mixtures of finer grained clay minerals and clay-sized crystals of other minerals such as quartz, carbonate, and metal oxides.

## Quartz: Mineral information, data and localities.
Quartz as a rock-forming mineral, in particular as irregular grains in the matrix, occasionally poses problems and may require additional means of identification. It may be confused with cordierite (pleochroic, tendency to alteration) and nepheline (lower hardness, geological environment incompatible with quartz).

## Surface textural analysis of quartz grains by scanning electron 
Although the microtextures of heavy minerals have been under investigation (e.g. Setlow and Karpovich, 1972, Mahaney, 2002, Moral Cardona et al., 2005), the main focus remains on quartz grains since quartz is ubiquitous in nearly every environment. Consequently, quartz grain surfaces provide a legacy of successive sedimentary cycles.

Quartz, therefore, is a nice compromise. It has the look of stone, but it functions much more like a solid surface. In fact, quartz is nearly indestructible. It is not prone to cracking or scratching. Moreover, the surface is not porous like natural stone. Therefore, it will not stain, and it is very easy to clean.

Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.
