## Sea Water Cooling System | ARANER
This process is not very different from the conventional system. The process of sea water cooling system is simple. Water pumps from a lake or an ocean. The water goes through a heat exchanger. A fresh water distribution system goes through the heat exchanger and cools via a closed loop. Cool water is then distributed to cool the buildings. Fig 1.
