Manufactured sand is the product created when coarse sand or rock is processed in a mechanical crusher. These units are expensive, and it takes a long time to produce the desired product. Typically manufactured sand is about twice as expensive as mined sand. To the naked eye, there is no way to tell manufactured sand apart from mined sand.
