## How Do You Separate Sand, Salt and Iron Filings?
Spread the sand, salt and iron mixture on a flat surface. Wrap the magnet in the paper towel. Use the magnet to remove the iron by pulling it across the surface of the mixture. The filings stick to the magnet while the sand and salt are left behind. Remove the paper towel from the magnet to collect the filings. Use warm water to dissolve the salt.
