## Impact Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Impact Crusher Working Principle. Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them. Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on
