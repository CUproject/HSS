Silver is found in lead, zinc, gold and copper ore deposits. The most important ore mineral of silver is argentite (Ag2S, silver sulfide). Silver is commonly extracted from ore by smelting or chemical leaching. Uses. Silver has been used for thousands of years for jewelry and decorative items of all types. Likewise, it has been used for silverware.

Assuming that the driving force for the process was natural air blast, the height of this part of the furnace had to reach about 120 cm. A shaft was mainly used for feeding ore and charcoal to the furnace enabling their slow transfer to the reduction zone.

## Patio process
The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

## Smelting - Assignment Point
Article. Smelting is the process by which a metal is obtained at temperatures beyond the melting point from its ore. It is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy. An ore is a naturally occurring solid material from which a metal or valuable mineral can be extracted profitably.

Smelting Furnace of Iron Ore Laboratory-scale experiments showed that pig irons and steels of acceptable grade can be made by arc-furnace methods from east Texas siliceous ores containing less than 25 percent iron. Under highly reducing conditions, 97 to 99 percent of the iron in the ore was recovered as pig iron.
