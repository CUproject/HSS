The Gold Belle Mining and Milling Company was formed around 1900 by Wildmand and Williams near the rough mining town of Wildman. The Gold Belle Co. erected a 50 tone cyanide mill to process the gold ore. Today on the cooling tower and concrete foundation remain as evidence of the short-lived gold rush. At the top of the hill is the cooling tower.
