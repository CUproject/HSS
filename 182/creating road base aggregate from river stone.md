The base course requires 100% of the material to pass a 1 inch sieve, but allows up to 20% of the stone to be retained on the 3/4 inch sieve.While this could make excellent base gravel, it would likely perform poorly if used as gravel surfacing. There would be too much large stone resulting in very difficult blade maintenance.
