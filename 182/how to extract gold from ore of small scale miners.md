## Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining in Africa | Geology for Investors
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) happens in almost all mineral active African countries. Gold is mined in two ways; one on hard rocks where gold found embedded in quartz vein is extracted using simple tools. Mined ore is then crushed either manually using a hammer or by a crusher.  The miners extract the loose ore using shovels

## how to extract gold from ore of small scale miners
Mercury‐dependent artisanal and small‐scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice, elemental mercury is used to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand and then heated—often with a torch or over a stove—to distill the mercury and isolate the gold.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
