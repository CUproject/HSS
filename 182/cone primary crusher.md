## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed to generate the desired product for a job. Depending on the setup, primary crushing will take the larger material that has been blasted, excavated, or reclaimed and process it through an impactor, jaw, or gyratory crusher to generate a range of

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Cone crushers are used for intermediate and fine crushing after primary crushing. The key factor for the performance of a cone type secondary crusher is the profile of the crushing chamber or cavity. Therefore, there is normally a range of standard cavities available for each crusher, to allow selection of the appropriate cavity for the feed

Cone Crushers Mclanahan. A cone crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point as the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression
