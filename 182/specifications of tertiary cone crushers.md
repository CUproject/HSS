They are normally used in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary crushing stages. However, in cases where the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed, also cone crushers can carry out the first stage of the crushing process.

Dec 7, 2021Cone crushers can be used in the primary, secondary, and tertiary position. These crushers are available in stationary, track and mobile designs. Cone crushers are also used in the steel furnace slag industry, which is a much more abrasive slag than blast furnace. Impact crushers, initially, are less expensive than cone crushers.
