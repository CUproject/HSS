Crushed stone and river sand were respectively used for natural coarse aggregate (NCA) and fine aggregate (NFA). The maximum grain size of both natural and recycled coarse aggregates was 25 mm, in accordance with KS F 2527 [ 36 ]. Figure 2 shows the four types of aggregate used in this study, and Table 1 lists their physical characteristics.

1.Size of Coarse Aggregates: The size of the coarse aggregate depends on the use of the concrete is to be poured. For large-scale concreting operations without complex reinforcement, large aggregates of size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm are used. For the simple construction of residential or other buildings, 20 mm is the maximum size will be used.
