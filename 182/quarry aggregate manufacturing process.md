The quarrying technique consists of drilling and blasting to fragment the rock. A large number of charges are fired at one time, producing up to 20,000 tons of broken stone in one blast. The broken stone is crushed into smaller pieces that are separated into uniform classes by screening. Read More on This Topic mining: Quarrying

Quarry process is known by a few different names, including QP, Dense Graded Aggregates (DGA), shoulder stone, item #4, crusher run and DGABC. Quarry process is composed mostly of 1" minus crushed stone and stone dust.

## Construction Aggregates 101: What They Are (and Why They Matter) - AEM
Jul 8, 2021Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.

The first approach is perhaps the most common: producing coarse aggregates that are virtually the same as those of other suppliers and trying to compete on the market with price. This usually involves having only a marginal profit from every sold tonne and an unavoidable need to produce and sell huge volumes to render the operation profitable.

Quarrying and aggregates is big business in virtually every part of the world - and market figures suggest it's only getting bigger. Experts predict that between 2018 and 2026, the market for construction aggregates will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8%. With this kind of growth, the industry will naturally become more valuable, too.

ii. Fine aggregate (sand): Aggregates passing No.4 (4.75 mm) sieve and predominately retained on the No. 200 (75 Î¼m) sieve. In accordance with sources: i. Natural aggregates: This kind of aggregate is taken from natural deposits without changing their nature during the process of production such as crushing and grinding.
