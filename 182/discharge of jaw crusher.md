## Discharge Opening of Jaw Crusher
With the continuous wear of the jaw plates, the discharge opening of jaw crusher will gradually increase. In this case, the final products size will get coarser. In order to balance the load of jaw crusher reasonably and to ensure the final products size meet requirements, we should check and adjust the discharge opening regularly.
