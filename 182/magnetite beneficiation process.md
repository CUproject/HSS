## Brief Introduction of Magnetite Beneficiation Process and Equipment 
Oct 15, 2021When the mineral is over-grinded, the bond force of the mineral particles is greater than its own inertial force, making the beneficiation process useless. The consequence is the reduction of the concentrate grade and the reduction of the metal recovery rate. This phenomenon exists. There are mainly the following factors.
