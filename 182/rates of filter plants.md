The Effect of Color Filters in Photosynthesis. Plants fare poorly when illuminated only with green light. Measuring the effects of light color on photosynthesis is a fun and simple experiment for middle or high school students. By growing the plants beneath color filters, you can determine which color of light produces optimal growth.

Using a water filter can solve many of these issues and your plants will surely be grateful for it! Plants are not fond of chlorine, which is present in most municipal water supplies, even though chlorine is a gas that can easily evaporate from water if left to "breathe". Even if you use water from a well, the water may still be „hard

## Trickling Filter - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The trickling filter is a nonsubmerged fixed film biological reactor using rock or plastic support media. The depth of the support media ranges from 0.9 to 2.5 m and averages 1.8 m. Filter beds are usually circular and the liquid wastewater is distributed over the top of the bed by a rotary distributor.

## Design of High-Rate Trickling Filters | Sewage | Waste Management
The important considerations in the design of high-rate trickling filters are the organic loading rate and the recirculation ratio. The efficiency of a high-rate trickling filter depends on both organic loading rate and recirculation ratio. A number of equations are available for the determination of plant efficiency based on organic loading

## Drinking Water Filtration Using Granular Activated Carbon
In plants which utilize a surface wash, it is common to backwash at a low rate to allow the surface wash to scrub the top of the filter. The backwash rate is then increased to 15-17 gpm/ft2 for 10-15 minutes to wash the filtered particles from the filter. In deep bed filters and those in difficult filtration situations, an air scour is used.

The rate of flow on a filter depends on the type of filter. A rapid sand filter will have a flow of 2-3 gpm/square foot of filter area. The high rate filter may have 4-6 gpm/square foot applied to the surface. A constant rate flow valve is almost fully closed when a filter is clean so that the desired water level on top of the filter is maintained.

Those are more effective as the water is forced up through the rocks and gravel. A bog filter designed in this way is easy to maintain and clean. A filter like this shouldn't
