## Digital light processing of wollastonite-diopside glass-ceramic complex 
The printed wollastonite-diopside glass-ceramic samples, after the heat treatment at 1100 °C, possessed a bulk density of 0.47 g/cm 3, true density of 3.12 g/cm 3, and total porosity of 83 vol%. The apparent and true density were measured for printed glass-ceramic sample without base after sintering ( Fig. 3 C) and showed approximately the

## Processing of wollastonite and its application to coatings
Processing of Wollastonite. Wollastonite is generally dressed by hand sorting, magnetic separation only, floatation only or combined magnetic-floatation (or electric separation) processes. The purpose of ore-dressing is to mitigate the Fe content and to separate the calcite in it. Rich ores are hand picked or crushed at the ore-dressing site
