## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

During this process the water content of the iron ore is released, and its structure becomes looser, which makes it easier to smelt. Finally, we break up the burnt iron ore into 2-3 cm pieces to make it easier to load the iron ore into the furnace during the smelting process (See Figure 3). Step 3. Building furnaces.
