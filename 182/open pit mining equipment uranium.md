## Mining: Making the Most of Radioactive Caches - How Uranium Mining 
Uranium mines might appear expansive, but a relatively small number of workers perform duties at each site. Roughly 35 people help drill and place steel reinforcements into the ground to secure shafts with machines, 35 miners specialize in removing the uranium ore (in open-pit operations; 20 for underground) and about 25 individuals assist with the reclamation process in efforts to restore

## Why does opencast mining is cheaper for companies?
Score: 4.1/5 (44 votes) . It is cheaper to operate an open pit mine because less manpower and equipment is required.Strip mining, or open pit mining is profitable sooner than a shaft mine because more ore can be extracted from an open pit mine and more quickly.

## Why are open pit mines safer? - Realonomics
Open pit mining does offer some advantages over traditional deep shaft mining. Pit mining is more cost effective than shaft mining because more ore can be extracted and more quickly. The working conditions are safer for the miners because there is no risk of cave in or toxic gas.

## Cameco U101 - Mining
Open pit mining. When uranium ore is found near the surface, generally less than 100 metres deep, it is typically extracted by open pit mining. Soil and waste rock is removed using conventional earth moving processes to access the ore. The walls of the pit are mined in a series of benches to prevent them from collapsing.

## Open Pit Uranium Mining Equipment
Most uranium ore is mined in open pit or underground mines. The uranium content of the ore is often between only 0.1% and 0.2%. Therefore, large amounts of ore have to be mined to get at the uranium. In the early years up until the 1960's uranium was predominantly mined in open pit mines from ore deposits located near the surface

## Radioactive Waste From Uranium Mining and Milling | US EPA
Jul 29, 2022Uranium Ore (Carnotite). Milling: This process takes place at a mill after the ore containing uranium is removed from the Earth through open pit or underground mining.The ore is brought to a mill, crushed, and ground up before chemicals are added to dissolve the uranium. The uranium is then separated from the chemical solution, solidified, dried and packaged.
