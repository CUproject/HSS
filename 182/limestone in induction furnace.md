## Calcination of pulverized limestone particles under furnace injection 
The calcination behaviour of limestone particles (6-90 μm) under furnace injection conditions ( K) was determined. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of partially calcined particles revealed that calcination occurred over the total (internal and external) surface area with different calcination rates at different locations.

The blast furnace is similar in structure to a cupola furnace used in iron foundries. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce the lead. Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also keeps the lead from oxidizing.

## Iron Furnace, Foundry Furnace and Induction Furnace Information
The primary fuel source for cupola furnaces are coke using limestone for flux. By not using a crucible, the Cupola furnace is able to melt the metal at a faster rate.  Electric Induction Electric Induction furnaces are becoming all the more popular with large industrial size foundries that enjoy the clean burning and efficiency of an
