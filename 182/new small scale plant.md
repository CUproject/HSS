## Hydropower (Small-scale) | SSWM - Find tools for sustainable sanitation 
Adapted from SINGH (2009) and GAIUS-OBASEKI (2010) Hydropower plants are classified according to their energy production capacity, expressed in megawatts. While large scale hydropower plants can produce well over 100 MW, small hydropower plants generally produce less than 10 MW. Based on energy production capacity, small-scale hydropower production is broken into four size categories of pico
