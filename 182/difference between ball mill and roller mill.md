## What's the difference between a Roller Mill and a Hammer Mill?
Hammer Mill A finer particle size can be achieved in comparison to a roller mill. With proper filtration, the hammer mill allows for more efficient use of malt grains by increasing surface area. It requires less grain to make the same amount of beer when using a hammer mill. Modern method, reduces particles using impact force.
