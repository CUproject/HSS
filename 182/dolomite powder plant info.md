It has a calcium to magnesium ratio of 2:1. That's way too much magnesium for most soils. Magnesium is certainly an essential mineral. Too much of it, however, causes many problems. So if you add dolomitic lime to your lawn/garden every year, chances are you're just causing more compaction and weed problems.

## The Helpful Benefits of Dolomite Lime in Your Garden
1. To Adjust Soil pH. One reason gardeners use dolomite is to change the acidity, or pH, of their soil. To determine your soil's pH level, you'll want to start with a soil pH test, which you can buy at garden centers. Most plants do best with a pH of 6.0 to 7.4. If your soil registers with a pH of 5.9 or below, dolomite can raise the pH to make

Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.

## How To Use Dolomite Lime For Plants
Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.
