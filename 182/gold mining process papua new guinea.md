The Pacific is a region of immense deep-sea mining potential. In 2008 the Canadian mining company Nautilus Minerals provided its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Papua New Guinea Government to start deep-sea mining in the Bismarck Sea, in New Ireland Province, part of the Pacific Ocean, not far from Bougainville Island. Nautilus hoped to become the world's first deep-sea mining firm.

History . Pueblo Canyon derives its name from a group of cliff dwellings. The nearby asbestos mine named Pueblo Mine takes its name from the canyon. Look for an old mining road that crosses FR203 (Cherry Creek Road) between mile 23 and mile 24. There is a partially buried steel drainage pipe that crosses FR203 just before the mining road.
