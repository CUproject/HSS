## Nigeria to save $300 million from importation of barite
Nigeria's Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr Olamilekan Adegbite, announced that Nigeria will ban the importation of barite to help the country save foreign exchange for other purposes. This comes as the Central Bank recently banned the importation of maize for the same reason as Nigeria aims to save foreign exchange in an era of falling oil revenue and OPEC production cuts.
