## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Ball Mill Grinding Media | Steel Balls for Ball Mills | AGICO Group
Steel balls are one of the most widely used grinding media in cement ball mills, their diameters can range from 20mm to 150mm according to different grinding requirements. In a cement ball mill, generally, φ50-100mm steel balls are used in the coarse grinding chamber, φ20-50mm steel balls are used in the fine grinding chamber. 2. Short Cylinders.

## This weird metal ball was found in an old train yard. It is an inch in 
Contestant (stormin') Norman technically did about the same thing on the GBBO. He used a piece of muslin as a sieve, and then he put heaps of icing sugar plus a golf ball inside, allowing the latter to work the same way a ball in a ball mill does, to break up the icing sugar for superior tarte au citron coverage.. He was booted off the show anyway, but got an encore on An Extra Slice:
