## 'Coal India's reserves depleting' | Business Standard News
CIL produced 1.05 billion tonnes of coal between April 2011 and August 2013. Therefore, its extractable reserve figure should now stand at 17.15 billion tonnes. Approximately, 90 per cent of India's coal inventory is non-coking coal. Using this yardstick, CIL's extractable non-coking reserves (2011) were estimated at 15.4 billion tonnes.

## Coal Mining in Africa - Mining Africa
The History of Coal Mining. Coal was used in South Africa as far back as the Iron Age (300 - 1880 AD). During this time charcoal was used to melt copper and iron. Large-scale usage of coal only started happening around the middle of the 19th century. Coal mining has undergone major development over the years.

Dec 14, 2021South Africa has just been given a purse of $8.5 billion to help accelerated its move away from coal. But as the international climate negotiations wrapped up in Glasgow, a few key developments at home suggest that the continent's biggest polluter is not in a hurry to end its relationship with coal.

South Africa has vast amounts of coal reserves spread mostly across Mpumalanga and Limpopo. South Africa consumes vast amounts of it via ESKOM who uses it to power their coal powered power stations. But just as we consume a lot of it, a lot of South Africa's coal is exported via Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

##  SA COAL RESERVES, AFTER THE ACT - XMP Consulting
Due to the low cost and relative abundance of coal in South Africa, it provides about 75% of its primary energy requirements. More than 90% of electricity in South Africa is generated from coal-fired thermal power stations. Furthermore, after gold and the platinum group metals, coal is the third largest mineral export earner in South Africa today.

## 'Reserves' as a leading indicator to future mineral production
Many previous estimates of South Africa's coal reserves accepted that reserves of coal amount to about 80 x 109 tonnes and annual demand to about 40 x 106 tonnes, and concluded that reserves were adequate to supply the demand for about 2000 years.
