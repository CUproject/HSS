## What Are the Basic Principles of Cylindrical Grinding?
Grinding this part reduces the intensity of the friction it will be subjected to. The shaft therefore becomes more durable and reliable. Cylindrical grinding is also used in areas with particularly high technical requirements. Many industrial machines have ground parts, as do the vast majority of engines.

## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.
