## Mountaintop removal mining
Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or overburden, above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.

Gold mining uncovers more and more hydrothermal deposits in which gold mineralization is associated with sulfides and other compounds of base metals, arsenic, antimony, or tellurium.  it was first proposed by Sill in the late 1950's for treating arsenic sulfide ores and was used commercially for treating a cobalt-nickel arsenic ore
