1920s. In 1922, Dr. Andrew Szegvari devised a brand new type of mill to create the extremely fine sulfur dispersion he required for rubber vulcanization in his new liquid latex process. He had discovered that conventional ball milling methods took too long to deliver the fineness he required. Szegvari developed a mill based on the dynamics of grinding media in random motion, now known as

2.According to the particle size of the grinding material, the material is loaded into the cylinder by the hollow shaft of the wet grid ball mill feeding end. When the ball mill cylinder rotates, the grinding body acts on the cylinder liner due to the action of inertia and centrifugal force and friction. It is carried away by the cylinder.
