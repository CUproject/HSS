## Gypsum Mine Trail (Cheticamp) - All You Need to Know BEFORE You Go
The Gypsum Mine was where they used to mine gypsum. Eventually the mine was closed. They turned this for trails and a lovely lake, where people swim in it, generally in the evening. Everyone we met, encouraged us to visit this abandoned mine. It was amazing. I liked the lake the most, especially since the sun was reflecting its rays on it.

Gypsum is a mineral consisting of water-containing calcium sulphate (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). When calcined (roasted) at temperatures of °C, gypsum releases 75% of its water.

Deep below the rugged surface of Indiana's Martin County people work in two underground mines to extract and process an unusual mineral resource - gypsum. Gypsum (CaSO42H2O) is a soft, water soluble mineral that is processed to make critical building materials especially wallboard. Gypsum is mostly massive (Fig&period; 1A) but also forms silky satin spar (Fig&period; 1B).

Even though chemical contamination was insignificant, the bacteriological concentration indirectly arising from gypsum mining was higher than WHO (2006) guide values and therefore exposed the public to waterborne diseases.
