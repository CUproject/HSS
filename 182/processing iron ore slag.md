The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In practice, these gases are scrubbed and recycled. Inevitably, however, some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere. A byproduct of iron purification is slag, which is produced in huge amounts.

## During the extraction of iron slag produced is?
In the metallurgy of iron, limestone (CaCO3 ) acts as a flux and forms calcium silicate CaSiO3 (slag). How is slag removed during extraction of iron? In this part, Haematite (Fe 2 O 3) and Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are reduced to Ferrous Oxide (FeO). The limestone also decomposes to CaO which removes the silicate impurity of the ore in the form of
