## What Is The Standard Strength Of Concrete? - Big D Ready Mix
Studies indicate that traditional concrete's tensile strength varies between 300 and 700 psi, i.e., around 2 to 5 MPa. This means, on average, the tension averages about 10% of the compressive strength. Flexural Strength Of Concrete. Flexural strength establishes the ability of concrete to withstand bending.

## What is the Characteristic Strength of Concrete - Civil Planets
The characteristic strength of concrete is the result of the compressive strength of the concrete cube test. The design strength is the required strength of concrete to be designed as per the IS code. For example, assume that the strength of concrete required M25, and the target design strength is 28.5 N/Sqmm.

## Specified Compressive Strength VS Average Compressive Strength 
Reference ACI Concrete Knowledge Center: Results from the 7-day tests mentioned are usually not used for acceptance purposes, and thus there isn't a percent of the specified compressive strength that the cylinder must meet in order to pass the compressive strength test.

## Concrete Strength Acceptance Criteria IS:
(B) Flexural strength When both the following conditions are met, the concrete complies with the specified flexural strength. a) The mean strength determine from any group of four consecutive test results exceed the specified characteristic strength by at least 0.3 N/mm 2 b) The strength determined from any test result is not less than specified characteristic strength less 0.3 N/mm 2
