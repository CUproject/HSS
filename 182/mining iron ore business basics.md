## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

##  Guide to Standards - Iron Ore Mining - SAI Global
Guide to Standards - Iron Ore Mining 24 September 2013 4 of 39 Introduction Iron ore can be extracted underground by using tunnelling and shaft equipment, or it can be sourced at ground level through the use of open pit mines (also known as surface mines). Iron ore is then transported and shipped to milling plants.

## Using Portable XRF Analysis for Ore Grade Control in Mining
Portable XRF instruments provide fast acquisition of geochemical data for ore deposit modeling, easily determining elemental constituents for most natural low concentration samples, as well as high grade ore concentrates. XRF (X-ray fluorescence) is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials.
