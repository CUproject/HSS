## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? | Belt Functions, Uses & Applications - SEMCOR
A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two. If objects are particularly heavy or bulky — or if the conveyor belt is carrying them for a long distance or

Sep 9, 2022Belt Conveyors for bulk materials: Take up Arrangement: All belt conveyors require the use of some form of belt conveyor take up device for the following reasons: To ensure adequate tension of the belt leaving the drive pulley so as to avoid any slippage of the belt. To ensure proper belt tension at the loading and other points along the conveyor.

If the unloading trolley is used, because the actual inclination angle of the conveyor belt entering the unloading trolley is relatively large, the belt speed should not be too high, generally less than 3.15m/s; when the plow-shaped unloader is used, there is additional resistance and Wear and tear, the belt speed should not exceed 2. 5m/s

You can go with a variant of stevenh's idea. Use a reflective opto sensor, but instead of facing across, measuring spacing between boxes, aim it up at the underside of the belt. Attach reflective tape to the belt at a fixed spacing and use the sensor to read the time between reflections and convert that to speed.

In the case of a conveyor going down-hill where the load is overhauling and the job of the drive is to hold-back, it is better to arrange the drive at the tail pulley. In general the speed/torque characteristics of a.c. motors up to 200 HP are defined in standards published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (N.E.M.A.).

## Belt (mechanical)
A belt is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating shafts mechanically, most often parallel. Belts may be used as a source of motion, to transmit power efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over pulleys and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.. In a two pulley system, the belt can either drive the pulleys normally

## Underground Conveyor Belts | West River Conveyors
Underground Conveyor Belt Construction . Most underground conveyors are kept as narrow as possible, running at high speed for maximum capacity. However, for operations that can use greater widths, Depreux conveyor belts are available in widths up to 84". Tensile strength is another vital parameter for conveyor belts.

## Speed of the conveyor belt Calculator
The Speed of the conveyor belt formula is defined as Conveyors move boxes at about the same speed as a person carrying them. This is about 65 feet per minute is calculated using Speed of a Body = (Length  Flow rate)/ Weight of Material.To calculate Speed of the conveyor belt, you need Length (L), Flow rate (Fr) & Weight of Material (W L).With our tool, you need to enter the respective value

## Increasing Conveyor Speed
Sharp edged lumpy material like black stone (particularly for larger size lumps) necessitates slower speed of conveyor and also lower speed of incoming material at feed point; or else it can damage belt. 5) Conveyor speed for specialised situation, like space constraint in mines or boom conveyor of stacker-reclaimer machines, etc.
