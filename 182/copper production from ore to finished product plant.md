Mining is a process of extraction of valuable minerals or geological substances from the earth; however, mining degrades the ecosystem. Earlier studies have discovered that about 10-15% of the ore mined is not utilized and discarded due to lack of cost-effective extraction technology for low graded ore in India.

copper production from ore to finished product. Copper Mining and Processing Processing of Copper Ores. The final product of the thickening stage is a combination of 30 copper and other metals this copper concentrate is then sent to the smelter At the smelter high temperatures are used to further purify the ore in a series of smelting steps.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide
