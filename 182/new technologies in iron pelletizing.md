## Next Generation Technology and Products | Natural Resources  - NRRI
Next Generation Iron Ore Technology and Products Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range has long served the domestic steel industry with iron ore. By the end of WWII, all of the lean ore (unprocessed, direct-ship) was mined out. A University of Minnesota researcher developed the process for turning low-grade ore (taconite) into pellets that could replace the lean ore in blast furnaces.

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.
