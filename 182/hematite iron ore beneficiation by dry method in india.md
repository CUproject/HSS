## Hematite Iron Ore Beneficiation Flow Chart
The early hematite beneficiation is mainly gravity separation with machines of jigger, centrifugal separator, spiral chute, spiral washer, shaking table can be involved and later floatation separation and floatation separation has been used in the hematite iron ore upgrading with floatation separator and magnetic separator involved. However, these single separation methods can not help to get
