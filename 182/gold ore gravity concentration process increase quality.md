## Advantages Of Using Gravity Concentration For Gold Recovery
While froth flotation and cyanide leaching both play major roles in gold recovery, the benefits of using gravity concentrators cannot be understated. As a low-cost addition to any circuit, it helps optimize the recovery process and mitigates processing risks due to ore variability. Here are just a few advantages of adding gravity concentrators

Mining is a process of extraction of valuable minerals or geological substances from the earth; however, mining degrades the ecosystem. Earlier studies have discovered that about 10-15% of the ore mined is not utilized and discarded due to lack of cost-effective extraction technology for low graded ore in India.
