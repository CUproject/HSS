Synchronous motor: Stator poles rotate at the synchronous speed (Ns) when fed with a three phase supply.The rotor is fed with a DC supply. The rotor needs to be rotated at a speed near to the synchronous speed during starting. If done so, the rotor poles get magnetically coupled with the rotating stator poles, and thus the rotor starts rotating at the synchronous speed.

## What is a synchronous motor and how do synchronous motor work?
Nov 16, 2020The structure of a synchronous motor is very similar to the construction of an alternator and asynchronous motor. Just like any other motor, the two main parts of the synchronous motor are a stator and a rotor. The key components of the synchronous motor are: Stator: The stator is the stationary part of the motor.

## The construction of a synchronous motor resembles - Electrical Exams
Synchronous Motor Construction. The basic construction of a synchronous motor is identical to that of a synchronous generator or Alternator. In small sizes, the rotor carries the three-phase windings, and in large sizes, they are provided in the stator and the rotor carries the field winding.

## Reluctance motor vs induction motormobilefo
Reluctance motors can be designed for constant speed operation from a constant frequency supply. The rotor has salient poles without field windings. The stator is cylindrical and contains a three-phase winding similar to that of an induction machine. A damper winding is fitted in the rotor surface so that the machine can start as an induction.
