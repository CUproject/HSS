## Thermal Power Plant : Principle, Parts, Working  - mech4study
In a thermal power plant, to complete the cyclic operation, we need to send water again to the economizer at high pressure. Steam exhausted from LP turbine is not in condensed form and it is not economical to compress the steam at a very high pressure around 150 Kg/cm2. So a device is needed which can condense the steam into water.

## Thermal Power Plant Operation - Mechanicaltutorial
The working principle of thermal power plant operation depends on Rankin Cycle. In a thermal power plant, coal is coming from coal storage and burnt in the boiler. It converts water into steam. This steam is expanded in the prime-mover (i.e. turbine) which produces mechanical power driving the alternator coupled to the turbine.
