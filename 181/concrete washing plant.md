## Concrete Washout Systems - Welcome
Wherever concrete is poured, equipment must be promptly rinsed cleaned. The resulting watery slurry has a pH almost as high as Drano - an environmental threat and a huge potential liability for the builder since the US EPA mandates that concrete washout pollutants be safely contained. CWS products serve this need.

## Acid Washing Concrete FAQ's
Yes, grass and plants that come in contact with the acid/water solution can be harmed, but usually only grass that is within 2-3 inches of the concrete edge will turn brown. Soak the grass and plants around the work area. The more the acid is diluted the better. Wash everything thoroughly. Back to Top.
