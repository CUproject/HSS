FGD Gypsum Production Process. Mineralogically identical to natural gypsum, FGD gypsum, or synthetic gypsum, is produced from gas captured within emission control systems at coal fired electric utilities. An emission that would compromise air quality, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) gas, is the primary contribution coal makes to FGD gypsum.
