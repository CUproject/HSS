## Oil sands - Energy Education
Oil sands. Figure 1. Oil sands production area in Fort McMurray, Alberta. [1] Oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen that occur naturally. Bitumen is the fossil fuel component of this sand, and it is a very viscous oil that must be treated and upgraded before it can be used to produce useful fuels such as gasoline. [2]

## Athabasca Oil Sands Project, Canada - Mining Technology
In December 2002, the Oil & Gas Journal reported that, holding 15% of the world's proven crude oil reserves, Canada ranks as number two in the world - after Saudi Arabia - with Alberta's oil sands accounting for the bulk of the country's store. As more projects come onstream, oil sands production is projected to make up about two thirds of Canadian oil production by 2010.

Abasands Oil was the first company to successfully extract oil from the oil sands through hot water extraction by the 1930s, but production was very low. WikiMatrix Low oil prices since the oil price collapse in 1986 slowed the oil sands production greatly, as oil extraction from the oil sands is a very expensive process and lower world prices

## Oil Sands Processes - NRCan
The first step is to collect the oil sands ore from the ground and transport it to a crushing facility. Gigantic shovels and trucks that can carry loads up to 400 tonnes are used. Once the oil sands ore is crushed, hot water is added so the ore can be pumped to the extraction plant. At the extraction plan more hot water is added to this slurry

## What Are Oil Sands? (Also known as Tar Sands) - Geology
The method used to extract bitumen from an oil sand depends upon how deeply the oil sand is buried. If the oil sand is deeply buried, wells must be drilled to extract the bitumen. If the oil sand is close to the surface, it will be mined and hauled to a processing plant for extraction.

## Oil sands
Oil sands, tar sands, crude bitumen, or bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit.Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with bitumen, a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum.. Significant bitumen deposits are reported in Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela.
