## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Learning Technology
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions. Aggregates with lower crushing value

The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e. weight of fines aggregates/weight of all aggregates = 10%). This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed as a percentage of the original mass is the aggregate crushing value.

## Disadvantages of glass powder in concrete
The government of Quebec (Canada) is trying to find a useful outlet for the mixed waste glass pilling up in its landfills. One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle.

the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve. For other size fractions, there is another recommended method.
