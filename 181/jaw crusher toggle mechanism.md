## What Is a Jaw Crusher? Here's How It Works - Cutting Technologies
Feb 18, 2021All jaw crushers will have one fixed jaw and a moving one. These two form a V-shaped chamber, where the materials are fed. The movable jaw will move back and forth against the fixed one, compressing all materials in the space between. The mobile jaw's movement will not be fixed from side-to-side.

Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first overhead eccentric jaw crushers. Since that time, this robust design has continued to be the basis of the Universal Jaw Crusher design. In addition to the standard jaw crusher design, McLanahan also produces the H-Series, which features adjust-on-the-fly capabilities.

## Jaw Crusher | manufactor | thyssenkrupp Mining Technologies
Double-toggle jaw crushers are the ideal machines for the hardest and most tenacious materials. They are equipped with a double-toggle system, which is controlled by a pitman that moves up and down under the influence of an eccentric shaft, causing the toggle plates to alternately flex and stretch. As a result, the swing jaw oscillates.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.
