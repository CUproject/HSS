Ion Exchange. With this type of water filtration, ions are exchanged for other ions. An ion is a positively or negatively charged particle. The two most common ion-exchange methods are softening and deionization. A water softener usually replaces calcium and magnesium ions from the water with sodium ions contained in filtration beads.
