## Gypsum Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.

Allen Pyle. Gypsum is calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO 4 2H 2 O). It is a natural mineral that occurs in certain types of sedimentary rocks. Gypsum forms when water evaporates in mineral-rich marine soil environments. Over long periods of time, evaporation brings more minerals to the soil surface, eventually forming a solid deposit.
