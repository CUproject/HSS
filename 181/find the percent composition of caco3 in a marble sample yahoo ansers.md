## A sample of calcium carbonate CaCO3 has the following class  - Vedantu
The percentage compositions of the elements of calcium carbonate are given as: Ca = 40%; C = 12%; O = 48%. As it is also given that the law of constant proportion holds true, then this means that even the sample of 4g of calcium carbonate will have the percentage composition of the constituent elements as: Ca = 40%; C = 12%; O = 48%.

## find the percentage composition of each element in calcium carbonate.
Ans: We know formula for Calcuim carbonate is CaCO3 And we know that in one mole of CaCO3, one mole of Calcium,one mole of Carbon and three moles of Oxygen is present. Molar mass of CaCO3 = 40+12+163 = 100 g/mol Element Percent composition
