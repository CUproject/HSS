## Small-Scale Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The role of local communities and artisanal miners is evolving into an essential part of resource management. Artisanal or small-scale mining (ASM) is often viewed as a subset or side effect of larger mining operations, but in actuality it is an essential part of life for millions of people in developing nations.

## Ghana needs to re-think its small scale mining strategy. Here's how
Apr 20, 2021Artisanal and small-scale mining is estimated to support the livelihoods of some 4.5 million Ghanaians, about 12% of the population. They account for more than 60% of the country's mining sector labour force. Artisanal and small-scale mining is a low-tech, indigenous and often informal. It occurs in over 80 mineral-rich developing countries.

Mar 19, 2021Is the Miniveyor the ultimate solution for small-scale and artisanal mining companies? Ultimately, Miniveyor provides an accessible, affordable option for operations concerned about access. It means lower costs and it requires a materially reduced gulley profile (particularly the depth of the gulley) compared to conventional gully cleaning systems.
