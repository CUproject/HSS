## Capex and capacity
Jun 23, 2021With forecasts of 2021 CapEx growth in the range of 16% to 23%, the industry is nowhere close to the "danger line" of over 40% growth. Even if CapEx growth accelerates in the second half of 2021, it is not likely to exceed 30%. TMSC is comfortable with a 74% CapEx increase since it has numerous foundry customers clamoring for more capacity.
