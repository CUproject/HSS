## How to calculate motor drive torque for belt and pulley systems
For a belt drive system, the motor torque required during constant velocity is simply the total axial force (F a) on the belt multiplied by the radius (r 1) of the drive pulley. Tc = torque required during constant velocity (Nm) Fa = total axial force (N) r1 = radius of drive pulley (mm) η = efficiency of belt drive system.

## Belt Feeders | Pentair AES
These belt feeders slowly dispense almost any dry medication, chemical or feed over a 12- or 24-hour period. If shorter length or intermittent feeding is desired, the conveyor belt can be pulled back halfway or feed can be spaced on the belt. These feeders will reduce labor costs and improve growth rates. Models BFS12A and BFS24A measure 21-7/8"L x 8-5/8"W x 4-3/4"H, and models
