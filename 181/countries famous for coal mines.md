## Poland - Biggest Mining Country in Europe - APCOM
In the mid-18th-century coal mining became prominent. The Silesian coalfields grew into major industrial regions. In east Galicia oil mining developed a bit later. In 1919 a mining academy was established in Cracow with the aim of educating new engineers. Poland's reserves of hard coal are estimated at 45.4 billion tons.

## List of countries by coal reserves
China mines almost half the world's coal, followed by India with about a tenth. Australia accounts for about a third of world coal exports, followed by Indonesia and Russia. [4] Coal is largely held in the Earth in areas that it needs to be mined from, and is generally present in coal seams.
