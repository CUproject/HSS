## Rare Earth Elements (REE): Why are they strategically important?
Rare earth elements (REE) are a group of seventeen chemical elements that occur together in the periodic table, 15 lanthanides ( Z=57 through 71), Scandium and Yttrium. All are metals and have many similar properties which often cause them to be found together in geologic deposits. That is why they are also known as rare earth metals.

The existing recycling infrastructure for fluorescent bulbs makes them good candidates for rare earth recycling, many experts say. With price pressures off, at least for now, and few laws requiring recycling, there is little incentive to try to get the materials back. As of 2011, less than 1 percent of rare earths were recycled.

## Rare earth elementst
From cerium to yttrium, the 17 rare earth elements (REEs) are little known to the general population, but their magnetic and optical properties make them essential to modern technologies including wind turbines, medical devices, drones, electric vehicles (EVs) and electronics displays. "In the 21st century you've got all these

## History and Future of Rare Earth Elements
Use of rare earth elements in electronics expanded through the 1990s and the 2000s. In the early 1990s Bell Labs developed the erbium-doped fiber amplifier to boost the signal in fiber-optic cables. These small devices made possible a global network of long fiber-optic cables that reduced the price of long-distance telephone calls and now carry

## Recycling the Rare Earth Metals of E-Waste
11/13/2017. Departments: Chemical and Environmental Engineering. Recycling the valuable rare earth metals found in advanced electronics from smartphones to plasma screen TVs has been a challenge for both manufacturers and environmental groups. Yale researchers, though, have developed a technology that could recover these materials for reuse.
