## Bentonite - Earth Resources
Jun 2, 2021Bentonite is a very plastic clay that shrinks (or swells) markedly in response to the removal (or addition) of water. There are three main types of bentonite: high swelling (sodium) low swelling (calcium) moderate swelling (intermediate sodium-calcium) bentonite. The sodium bentonites are the most useful because of their greater swelling capacity.
