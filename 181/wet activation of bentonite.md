## Frontiers | Potential of Acid-Activated Bentonite and SO3H 
Bentonite activation was performed with three different concentration of H 2 SO 4 (3, 5, and 10 N), in order to investigate the impact of acid concentration on the surface area. Compared with natural bentonite, acid-activated bentonite displayed about 38-51% larger surface area (Table 1).
