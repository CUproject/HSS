## Beneficiation of limestone plant rejects for value addition
In this plant, beneficiation is done by simple crushing and scrubbing followed by classification at 1 mm. The +1 mm fraction is used for cement industries where as the fines (âˆ’1 mm size fraction) is discarded as rejects due to very low in grade. The quantity of this reject is around 20-25% of the feed.

## Prospects of utilization of waste dumped low-grade limestone for iron 
For low-grade limestone where the liberation is at a finer size, mechanical cell does not respond effectively due to the larger size of the bubbles. The effective bubble-particle collision reduces with the increase of bubble size in the mechanical cell and thereby decreases the efficiency of the process in terms of the recovery and grade.

The beneficiation study of limestone was carried out for low-grade limestone from a small Mine, near Sankagiri, Salem district. The various rock types encountered within this limestone deposit are pegmatites, quartz veins, biotite gneisses and pyroxene gneisses. A few run of mine samples were collected for petrological characterization.

## Current strategies and future challenges on exploration, beneficiation 
Reduction in oxygen consumption, improve- Scope for value addition ment in quality of steel in terms of low P content, reduction in costs, higher lining life and an increase in Beneficiation production by 2.5% are some of the benefits derived Improving the quality of sub-grade ores in order to from low silicon levels.
