## the chemical and physical separation methods in mining - FOUR CINQ
What are the chemical and physical separation methods used. For chemical physical separation method, we usually use flotation process, leaching method to do gold mining. Because in the process, we will use chemical to extract gold from ore. Such as flotation reagent, sodium cyanide and ecofriendly gold dressing agent. Inquire Now.

## 25.4 Separating minerals from waste | Mining of mineral resources 
Size separation is used frequently in mining to classify ore. For example, when iron ore is exported, it needs to be a certain size to be acceptable to the world market.  The valuable minerals are then separated from the rock using a variety of physical and chemical separation methods. People have extracted minerals, for example iron and

## How Gravity Separation Works to Recover Metals and Minerals
This rudimentary piece of mineral processing equipment uses pulses of water to suspend the particles in water. As the pulses dissipate, the particles settle in the bottom of the jig. Particles with a higher specific gravity (like gold) settle faster than those with a lower specific gravity, effectively separating the gold so it can be collected.

Stripping is exactly the reverse, the transfer of a component from a liquid phase in which it is dissolved to a gas phase. There are three types of absorption processes: separation based on physical solution; separation based on reversible chemical reaction; and separation based on irreversible chemical reaction.

Separation techniques mineral processing Flotation. Flotation is a gravity separation process which exploits differences in the surface properties of particles. Gas bubbles are generated in a liquid and become attached to solid particles or immiscible liquid droplets, causing the particles or droplets to rise to the surface. This is used to separate mixtures of solid-solid particles and liquid

There are five major separation methods. In the filtration method, the mixture is passed through a filter paper, the liquid gets strained to leave behind suspended particles. The centrifugation method is used to strain the tiny suspended particles which could not be captured by the filtration method.
