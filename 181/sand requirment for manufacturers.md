## Sand Casting - Process Introduction - Impro Precision
Sand casting is a metal forming process in which a mold is first formed from a three-dimensional pattern of sand, and molten metal is poured into the mold cavity for solidification. The sand shell is subsequently removed after the metal components cooled and formed. Sand casting is a cost-effective and efficient technology, which is generally flexible with regards to size and change of
