## India's beneficiation of low-grade iron ore could result in new trade 
Aug 19, 2022An iron ore industry source in Singapore has doubts about India being a sustainable long-term supplier of high-grade iron ore. "There are costs involved in this. For example, new capital expenditure to set up beneficiation and concentration plants, so it's not likely that every miner will be able to do it," he said.

Hence, it is necessary to beneficiate low-grade iron ore into commercial-grade to fulfil the demand for raw material for steel making. The Committee noted that beneficiation plants for iron ore with iron content between 45%-55% is rare in India because of poor economics. The cost of beneficiation is directly linked to power cost.
