Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates: Its Classification, Properties & Uses
Mar 1, 2021Recycled concrete as aggregates are relatively weaker in strength as compared to the natural aggregates. Crushing and abrasion value of RCA is also lower then natural aggregates. The NA (natural aggregate) has an ACV (aggregate crushing value) that was about 27% higher than RCA-1, 43% higher than RCA-2 and 57% higher than RCA-3.
