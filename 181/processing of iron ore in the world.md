## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Jan 22, 2022Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
