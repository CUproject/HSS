Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore and magnetite as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification. Hematite however responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite so it is the preferred type of ore.

## Improving recovery of iron using column flotation of iron ore slimes 
Nov 1, 2020In general, the industrial flowsheets for the beneficiation of itabirite iron ores from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero (Minas Gerais state) in Brazil involves grinding, desliming, magnetic separation and cationic reverse flotation using both mechanical and columns flotation cells. At Brazilian plants, it is estimated that Fe losses generated at the slimes stage range between 8% reaching values
