manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

## Dephosphorization of high-phosphorous manganese ores from Andhra 
Because conventional (physical) methods of ore dressing are not suitable for reducing the phosphorus contents of high-phosphorous manganese ores from Andhra Pradesh (AP) and the adjoining area in southern Orissa, India, the adoption of chemical methods becomes imperative. An attempt was therefore made to reduce the phosphorus content of partially beneficiated manganese ores from AP by roasting
