## How does the mining sector impact the South African economy?
Jun 24, 2021Mining contributes 11% of gross capital creation but also 16% of total direct foreign investment in South Africa. Despite accounting for just 0.3 percent of taxpayers, the sector was liable for 6 percent of the tax imposed in 2014. Although quarrying employs about 500,000 people, it accounts for barely 5% of the country's employment.
