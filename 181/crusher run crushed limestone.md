## Crusher Run Stone - Cumberland, MD - Ebyland LLC
Sometimes called "crush and run," this type of stone is a mixture of coarse, angular crushed limestone, stone screenings, and stone dust. The sizes of the grains can range from fine dust to ¾" in diameter. Because it is such a mix of sizes, crusher run compacts into a firm, solid base layer for roads, driveways, or other structures.

## Friction angle of crushed rock - Geotechnical engineering general 
The angle of internal friction of a crushed stone will be directly influenced by type of rock and grain size. Forty-one (41) seems to me possible, but dangerous. I would use a safe 36 degrees unless a direct shear test is performed on a sample. There's at-rest earth pressure and active earth pressure.
