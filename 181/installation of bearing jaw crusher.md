## What is Jaw crusher? - Quora
A jaw crusher is a machine that is used for crushing or breaking materials such as rocks, ore, and stones. The machine consists of a number of rotating grinding discs that create a high-pressure and high-velocity impact on the material. This impact causes the material to break into smaller pieces that can then be removed by the machine.
