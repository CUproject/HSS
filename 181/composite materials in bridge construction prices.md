## Cost of Building a Bridge: What You Need to Know | Areté Structures
Mar 31, 2021When it comes to building a pedestrian bridge, many factors ultimately determine the bridge cost. The bridge material determines the cost, size, intended use (i.e., only pedestrian or light vehicle traffic), safety, labor required, and location. In general, the average price of a 20 linear foot fiber-reinforced polymer Truss Bridge is $10,000.
