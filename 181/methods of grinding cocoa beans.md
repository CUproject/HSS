## cocoa powder making machine for grinding cocoa beans - Taizy Machinery
The cocoa bean grinding machine grinds cocoa beans by the relative movement between the movable and fixed gears of the grinder. When grinding, the cocoa beans are crushed by the shear and friction generated by the relative movement of the two. The machine can grind into powders of different sizes by replacing the different sizes of grinders.
