## Corruption and coal dug up in Indonesia
Nevertheless, the government has ramped up coal output. President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo called for the construction of 117 new coal-fired power plants to counter the mine closures and economic pain caused by the recent global coal slowdown. China's imports of Indonesian coal fell by 49% in 2015 alone.
