The pulse velocity in the crushed limestone aggregate concrete was 4.55 km/s while it was in the range of 4.6 to 4.94 km/s in the steel slag aggregate concretes. This indicates that the steel slag aggregate produces a denser concrete compared to the crushed limestone aggregates even when the proportion of steel slag aggregate was as low as 50%.

The proposed limestone crusher is Impact Crusher, it can crush the material from 1m to -25 mm size. The crushed limestone will be sent by a belt conveyor to vibrating screen becoming final products or to grinding mill to fine grind. If the raw limestone is small enough and can be directly grinded by grinding mill, it can be grinded directly.
