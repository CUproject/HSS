## how to calculate critical speed of a ball mill - KOOKS
Ball Mill Operating Speed - Mechanical Operations Solved  The critical speed of ball mill is given by, where R = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. For R = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. But the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. Therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed.

Apr 11, 2022The typical mechanical inching drive motor speed is around 1500 to 1800 RPM while the mill inching speed is in the order of 0.1 to 0.15 RPM. Thus, the gear reduction ratio between the inching drive motor and the mill is roughly 12,000 to 1. What this means is that the inching drive motor must turn 12,000 times to be able to turn the mill once.

Critical speed is defined as the point at which the centrifugal force applied to the grinding mill charge is equal to the force of gravity. At critical speed, the grinding mill charge clings to the mill inner surface and does not tumble. Most ball mills operate at approximately 75% critical speed, as this is determined to be the optimum speed

The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed", and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed. Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer, down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills, they must be operated in a closed

Jul 18, 2021The image above represents critical mill of speed. To compute for critical mill of speed, two essential parameters are needed and these parameters are Mill Diameter (D) and Diameter of Balls (d). The formula for calculating critical mill of speed: N c = 42.3 / √ (D - d) Where: N c = Critical Speed of Mill. D = Mill Diameter.

## Mill Critical Speed Determination
The "Critical Speed" for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface. This is the rotational speed where balls will not fall away from the mill's shell. Mill Inside Diameter: Feet Metres. Enter the mill diameter inside the shell (excluding liners).
