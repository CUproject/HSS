## Is iron a igneous or sedimentary rock? - Answers
Iron, or Iron Ore, is a mineral that is found within rock. It would be more likely to be found in igneous rocks as a vein or ore to be mined. However, red sandstone has particles of iron ore

## What are Igneous, Sedimentary, & Metamorphic Rocks? - Utah
Metamorphic rocks are any rock type that has been altered by heat, pressure, and/or the chemical action of fluids and gases. Metamorphic rocks are classified by their structure and their dominant minerals. Metamorphic rock structure is either foliated (has a definite planar structure) or nonfoliated (massive, without structure).

Sedimentary-metamorphic iron deposits are the most common of the iron deposit types in China and account for approximately 56.3% of the proven ore reserves in the country. Iron skarn deposits in China occur along or near the contact zones between Mesozoic intermediate-felsic, medium- to shallow-level intrusions and carbonate country rocks.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

A large proportion of the world's zirconium, hafnium, rare earths, and thorium, and some iron and titanium, come from such deposits in river and beach sands. A large number of important ore deposits occur in metamorphic rocks. The ultimate origin of these deposits is frequently obscured by the complex processes they have undergone.

## Skarn | Types, Composition, Formation, Uses » Geology Science
Skarn, in geology, metamorphic zone developed in the contact area around igneous rock intrusions when carbonate sedimentary rocks are invaded by large amounts of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium. Many skarns also include ore minerals; several productive deposits of copper or other base metals have been found in and adjacent to skarns.
