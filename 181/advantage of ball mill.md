Advantage #3 - Composite liners have a shorter delivery time. Due to the high production loss experienced every time a mill is shutdown, it's critical that mill liner deliveries are consistently on time to allow for inspection and preparation ahead of the mill stoppage. Composites are quicker to manufacture, which results in shorter lead times.
