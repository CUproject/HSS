## Industrial Use of Magnets • Advanced Magnet Source
The food production and pharmaceutical industries also make heavy use of magnetic technologies to remove excess iron that would otherwise contaminate their products. In order to remove that excess iron food, food manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies use a variety of magnets, including magnetic drums, magnetic grids and magnetic tubes.
