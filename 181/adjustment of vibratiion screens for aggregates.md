## 7 Factors Affect the Screening Efficiency of Vibrating Screen
The vibration frequency affects the beating state of the material on the screen surface, too high or too low will affect the screening efficiency of the vibrating screen. Therefore, the appropriate amplitude and vibration frequency must be selected according to the material. For example, if you want to classify materials, choose low frequency

Screening efficiency measures how much of the desired aggregate is accurately separated during the screening process. For example, if your screens are operating at 80% efficiency, that means 80% of the desired aggregate size passes through the screens while 20% does not. Efficiency should be as close to 100% as possible, but keep in mind that

## How to adjust the vibration screen amplitude is insufficient? | Haiside
Mar 23, 2021Method of adjusting the amplitude of vibrating screen. 1.If the vibration source is a vibration exciter,you can increase (decrease)the weight of the eccentric block (increase or decrease the secondary eccentricity). 2.If it is a vibrating motor,the amplitude adjustment depends on the angle between the eccentric blocks at both ends of the motor

## Tue Adjustment Of Vibratiion Screens For Aggregates
2.adjustment of eccentric block angle. the specific gravity of the material and the size of the mesh are different, and the motor angle needs to be changed. changing he angle of the eccentricity block of the motor to adjust the stay time and the trajectory of the material on the screen surface so as to achieve better screening effect.
