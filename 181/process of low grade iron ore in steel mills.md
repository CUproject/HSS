Mining is a process of extraction of valuable minerals or geological substances from the earth; however, mining degrades the ecosystem. Earlier studies have discovered that about 10-15% of the ore mined is not utilized and discarded due to lack of cost-effective extraction technology for low graded ore in India.

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Due to this reason the availability of high grade iron ore is reducing and the supply of high grade iron ore to iron and steel plants is declining sharply. Hence, the scenario is steadily shifting towards the use of low grade iron ores and slimes which are stock piled in the mine's sites for years. These dumped slimes also, in fact, falls in

## Why iron ore grade is now more important than ever - Stockhead
At the same time, very few new iron ore mines have been built or are in development, and the mines that are being built are largely replacing operations that are running out of ore. Higher grade = less impurities . Pure hematite is about 70 per cent Fe. The rest is impurities that require energy to remove them in the iron making process. The
