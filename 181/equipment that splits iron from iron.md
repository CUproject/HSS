A specialized blast furnace, known as a cupola, is used to achieve the temperatures necessary to melt iron and additives such as scrap steel and iron. The high heat also refines the melt which is then poured into a mold by hand or automatically. Any number of casts can be made and housed at a given foundry for continuous or one time use.

Iron equipment are items made from iron metal. Iron equipment is stronger than bronze equipment, but weaker than steel equipment. All iron items are coloured dark-grey. Iron armour requires 1 Defence to wield, weapons require 1 Attack, which makes it a suitable alternative to bronze equipment, which has the same requirements.
