## Uranium Mining Overview - World Nuclear Association
Uranium Mining Overview. (Updated June 2022) In the last 60 years uranium has become one of the world's most important energy minerals. It is mined and concentrated similarly to many other metals. While uranium is used almost entirely for making electricity, a small proportion is used for the important task of producing medical isotopes.
