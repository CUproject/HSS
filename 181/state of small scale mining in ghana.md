In January 2016 Ghana hosted a multi-stakeholder 'action dialogue' on artisanal and small-scale mining. This was the first of a global dialogue series on ASM, planned by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) to facilitate the rights-based formalisation of ASM within a more inclusive and responsible mining sector.

Small-scale mining is essentially an artisanal or small industrial form of raw material extraction. In Ghana, there are about 300 registered small-scale mining groups and they constitute a major source of employment especially for small-scale gold and diamond miners, and contribute some foreign exchange to Ghana's economy.

## Ghana small-scale mining strategy | Queen's University Gazette
Apr 29, 2021Artisanal and small-scale mining has a long history in Ghana. It was only in 1989, however, that government recognised its legitimacy through the Small-scale Mining Act (PNDCL 218), later integrated into the current Mining Act 703 (2006). The act provides a blueprint for its formalisation. It also reserves small-scale mining for Ghanaians.
