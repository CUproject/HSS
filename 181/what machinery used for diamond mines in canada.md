## 8 Different Types of Mining in Canada - Outlook Magazine
There are eight different types of mining in Canada: 1. Open-Pit Mining. This is one of the most common types of mining. Drilling starts from the earth's surface and maintains exposure to it during the period of extraction. As the excavation continues, steps are provided at the sides for the safety of miners.
