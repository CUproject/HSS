Jun 27, 2022The cross-sectional area is a geometric property of structural elements such as beams, columns, slabs, etc. and it is used to calculate the axial stresses in Cross-sections. In general it can be said that the greater the dimensions of a cross-section under a given load, the greater the Cross-sectional area and the smaller the axial stress.

The study examines data at a specific time and provides only a snapshot of data to researchers. By comparison, a longitudinal study can take years or even decades to complete as it requires researchers to gather data at multiple points in time.

## Ammonia
Ammonia can act as a ligand in transition metal complexes.It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate hard-soft behaviour (see also ECW model).Its relative donor strength toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots. For historical reasons, ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds.
