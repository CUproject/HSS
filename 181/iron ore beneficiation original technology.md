## Iron Ore - Beneficiation | Technology Trends
Beneficiation. In mining, beneficiation (occasionally spelled 'benefication') is a variety of processes whereby extracted ore from mining is separated into mineral and gangue, the former suitable for further processing or direct use. Based on this definition, the term has occasionally been used metaphorically for the economic development and corporate social responsibility to describe the

The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Application of biotechnology in iron ore beneficiation
In 20-40 years' time, all the world's quality iron ore will be gone, and only low-grade ore will be left for processing, so more efficient and economic beneficiation techniques will be necessary. Commercial iron ore flotation systems have concentrated on the removal of quartz (silica) as the steel industry requires feedstock that is < 2% SiO
