## Quartzite - Formation, Composition, Properties, and Uses
Quartzite (from German Quarzit) forms when quartz sandstones are metamorphosed. The term quartzite also implies its high quartz content. Most quartzites contain 90% quartz by volume, but the percentage can go up to 99% in the case of the purest quartzite forms. Quartzite looks similar to its parent rock but it is much harder than sandstone.

Quartz Quartz is a man-made engineered stone surface formed by combining 90% ground quartz (a natural hard mineral) with 8-10% resins, polymers, and pigments. This forms a very hard granite-like surface. How it looks depends on how the quartz is ground: coarsely-ground quartz produces a flecked appearance while finely-ground quartz produces a smooth look.
