For many years carbonaceous gold ores have been identified as having the ability to adsorb gold (I) cyanide from leach solutions1-14. This phenomenon, known as preg-robbing, is responsible for poor recoveries as the carbonaceous component of the ore competes with activated carbon used during the leaching and adsorption phase of processing.

Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

## Gold CIL process, Carbon in leach,Gold extraction process
Taking the gold cyanidation plant with the processing capacity of 100000 tons per year and gold grade of 7.5 g/t as an example, the gold CIL process can save the investment cost of $486000 than the CIP process, reduce the capital backlog of $201700, save and recycle capital of $675100 in advance excluding the cost of activated carbon.

## cil processing gold
CIP Gold Processing Plant . Gold CIL Processing Line Gold CIL Carbon in Leach Process is an efficient design of extracting and recovering gold from its ore By cyaniding and carbon leaching crushed gold ore slurry simultaneously CIL process lower the gold mining operation cost and increase gold recovery rate to a degree of 99 .
