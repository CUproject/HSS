## Indiana Limestone - City University of New York
The Salem Formation (a.k.a. Indiana Limestone) crops out along a thin, irregular arcuate band in south-central Indiana (Monroe and Lawrence counties).Most quarries lie between the cities of Bloomington and Bedford. The limestone is soft and easily worked when quarried, but once the quarried rock dries it becomes case-hardened, that is, its surface becomes harder and more resistant to weathering.

The quarrying process for obtaining building block, fence posts, or other products was the same: holes were drilled about 4 or 5" deep into the rock and 9- 12" apart along a line marked for splitting; feathers and wedges were placed in the holes; and tapping the wedges lightly with a stone hammer split out the slabs, posts, or blocks.
