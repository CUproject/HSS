## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in  - ReadCivil
The aggregate crushing value is defined as the ratio of the weight of fines passing through specified IS (here 2.36mm sieve) to the total weight of sample expressed in percentage. W1= Weigh of the total aggregates (Wa-We) W2= Weigh of aggregates passing through 2.36mm IS sieve.
