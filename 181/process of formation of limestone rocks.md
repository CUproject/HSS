## Shale | Properties, Composition, Formation, Uses » Geology Science
Shale. Shale is a laminated or fissile clastic sedimentary rock that composed of predominance of silt and clay other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. Characteristic properties of shale is breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding called fissility. It is most abundant sedimentary rock.

Oolitic limestone is made up of small spheres called ooiliths that are stuck together by lime mud. They form when calcium carbonate is deposited on the surface of sand grains rolled (by waves) around on a shallow sea floor.

The rock cycl e is a model that describes the formation, breakdown, and reformation of a rock as a result of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic processes. All rocks are made up of minerals. A mineral is defined as a naturally occurring, crystalline solid of definite chemical composition and a characteristic crystal structure.

Origin of limestones. Limestones originate mainly through the lithification of loose carbonate sediments. Modern carbonate sediments are generated in a variety of environments: continental, marine, and transitional, but most are marine. The present-day Bahama banks is the best known modern carbonate setting.

Granite is an igneous rock and as such is formed when molten rock, magma, cools slowly. Magma is found between the mantle and the crust of the earth, and often flows towards the surface of the earth.

Therefore the limestone, the soil, the mud and the groundwater would have all been frozen solid, making the rock impermeable, meaning that water could not seep into it. At the same time as the limestone was impermeable due to permafrost, there were massive outflows of melting glacier water, making a fast flowing powerful river right here.

Mar 4, 2022Underground limestone caves form through the natural chemical weathering process described above. Most caves form in karst, a landscape composed of limestone, gypsum, and dolomite rocks that dissolve gradually in slightly acidic water.. The water eats away the bedrock, forming underground passages that take as many as 100,000 years to become large enough for human entry.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Metamorphic Rocks: Formation, Types and Examples
The changes that occur in the process of metamorphism are because of the changes in the physical pressure and temperature, which alters the mineral composition and texture of the pre-existing igneous and sedimentary rocks to form metamorphic rocks. So, all metamorphic processes involve solid-state changes in the minerals. As per Wikipedia,

## The Geological Cycle: Rock formation
Rock formed from sediments covers 70-80 % of the earth's land area, and includes common types such as limestone, chalk, sandstone, conglomerate and shale. Mechanically formed: consisting of materials (gravels, sand, silt and clay) suspended in flowing water. The suspended materials are then deposited and consolidated.

## How Does Organic Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.
