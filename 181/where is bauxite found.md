## Where can boehmite be found?etta.ca
What rock is bauxite found in? If it is sufficiently high in alumina and low in silica, it is characterised as 'bauxite'. Laterite bauxites account for most of the world's major deposits of bauxite. Weathering of limestone gives rise to eroded surface and sub-surface features (caves & depressions) which are together known as 'karst'.

## Top Aluminum Producing Nations In The World - WorldAtlas
Aluminum is one of the lightest metals in the world and as a result it is used widely in the production of multiple product. This metal has a shiny silver color and it is malleable meaning it can be bend without breaking. In nature, aluminum is found in an ore called bauxite.This ore is refined using various techniques to produces aluminum oxide which is called alumina.

What type of rock is aluminum found in? Aluminum Geology Aluminum is primarily sourced from the rock bauxite. Bauxite is composed of aluminum hydroxide minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. Bauxite forms in areas of intense weathering of aluminum-containing rocks, such as igneous or metamorphic rocks that are rich in feldspar.

## What is Bauxite? - Mineral, Formula, Uses with Videos and FAQs - BYJUS
Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.
