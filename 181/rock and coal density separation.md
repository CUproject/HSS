Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities. This is partly due to different rocks of the same type containing different proportions of minerals. Granite, for example, can have a quartz content anywhere between 20% and 60%.

Sand - shale identification from gamma ray and density-neutron separation. Small amounts of density neutron separation with a low gamma ray may indicate some heavy minerals in a sandstone. Most minerals are heavier than quartz, so any cementing materials, volcanic rock fragments, or mica will cause some separation.

## Uranium
Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years.

For example, the specific gravity of pyrite (fool's gold), a common impurity in coal, and the main source of sulfur in coal, is 4.9 to 5.2. Because pyrite is much denser than coal, density separation techniques can be used during coal cleaning to remove much of the pyrite from coal. Coal Cleaning (Preparation, beneficiation)

## Rock And Coal Density Separation
 Mining is designed to first liberate the coal from the host clastic rock and beneficiation to liberate higher grade coal and discard stone and poorer quality coal through a process of comminution, density separation, and flotation that is controlled by particle size and surface chemistry.
