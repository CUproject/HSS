## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Chemical Engineering World
Sep 26, 2020Cement Manufacturing Process. Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates

All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

The principal reaction of this stage is as follows: Ca2SiO4 + CaO → Ca3SiO5. The liquid formed both acts as a solvent of ion exchange between the solid phases and draws the reactant particles together by surface tension. The powdery or granular mixture quickly solidifies into spherical nodules of clinker.
