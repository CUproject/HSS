## Lesson 7.3: Mechanical Surface Mining Methods - Open Cast Mining 
Open cast mining is usually associated with coal or other tabular deposits that are more or less flat-lying. A significant difference between open pit and open cast mining methods is that in open cast mining, overburden that is removed to gain access to the ore is immediately placed in the previously mined cut. Therefore, reclamation occurs

## Energy Use in the Mining Industry - The World Counts
The mining industry accounts for 10 percent of world energy consumption. Mining consumes gigantic amounts of energy. The energy consumption of the world's mining industry corresponds to 80 percent of the world's electricity use. Or the total energy consumption of Australia, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Canada.

4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.
