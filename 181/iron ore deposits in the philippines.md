Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.

Mineral Resources Philippine Statistics Authority. Iron ore, one of the Philippines' largest mineral deposits, is not being extracted at present This was due to the higher cost of production, making the local prices of iron not competitive to world prices However, exploration for possible mining sites is still being done In 1989, there was an addition of 101 million MT in total reserves

## mineral deposit - Iron deposits | Britannica
By far the most important metal from an economic and technical point of view is iron. Sedimentary iron deposits, from which almost all iron is obtained, can therefore be viewed as one of the world's great mineral treasures. There are two major types of deposit. The first, and by far the most important, is banded iron formations (BIFs), so called because they are finely layered alternations

Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Nickel Mines in the Philippines - PANDI Claims Management Inc.
Local mining firms in the Philippines use open-air stockpiles in order to solar-dry and lower the moisture content of the recently mined ore, however, it also means that they are subject to all weather conditions though it is the shipper's practice to cover all open-air stockpiles using large/modified tarpaulins in order to prevent moisture

## Iron - PUB2895 | Missouri Department of Natural Resources
Oct 7, 2020Iron ore deposits in Missouri are divided into three main types: Precambrian-hosted hematite and magnetite, filled-sink hematite and limonite or brown iron ore deposits. Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are the most economically significant ores. Limonite (FeO·OH·nH 2 O) was an important ore in the past.
