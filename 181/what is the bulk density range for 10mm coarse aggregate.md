## Bulk Density of Aggregates - Civil Snapshot
Jan 3, 2021Bulk density of aggregates is the mass of aggregates required to fill the container of a unit volume after aggregates are batched based on volume. It depends on the packing of aggregate i.e. Either loosely packed aggregates or well dense compacted aggregates. In case, if the specific gravity of a material is known, then it depends on the shape

## What is bulk density and % voids of coarse aggregates - Civil Sir
Bulk density is not an intrinsic property of any material and it can change depending on how the material should be handled. For example if we poured coarse aggregate into cylindrical metal measure unit will have loose bulk density and when it is disturbed with Tamping rod the coarse aggregate will go and settle closer together resulting in higher bulk density.

## Bulk Density Of Aggregates | Loose And Compact Bulk Density 
If a statement is like: A coarse aggregates with higher bulk density, then it means few of the voids can be filled by using fine aggregates and cement. For testing, British Standard (BS 812) has specified the degree of compaction. These are; Loose ( Un-compacted) Compacted; The test will be carried out by using metal cylinder having prescribed depth and diameter and the bulk density is to be
