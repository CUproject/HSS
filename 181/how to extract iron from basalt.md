Iron ore is a vein of iron oxide embedded in basalt rock. Gains iron ore chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain ores require special tools for successful mining of the mineral. If improper tools are used, the mineral is lost. Further processing in the furnace is required to extract the pure iron from the oxide .

Furthermore, water softeners are most efficient at removing iron from hard water. There needs to be an adequate ratio of water hardness and iron for the ion exchange to sufficiently remove iron from the water. If you have soft water, an oxidizing filter will be more effective at reducing the iron content of your water.
