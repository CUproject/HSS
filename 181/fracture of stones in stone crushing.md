## Fracture strength of type IV and type V die stone as a function of time
Statement of problem: During the removal of casts from the impression there is the risk of stone fracture. Purpose: This study evaluated the fracture resistance of four die stone materials at different time intervals. Material and methods: Additional silicone impressions were made of a maxillary master cast. Two Type V, one Type IV die stones and one Type IV resin reinforced stone were tested.
