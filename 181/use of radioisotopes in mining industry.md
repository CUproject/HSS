Radioisotopes examples. Examples of natural radioisotopes are 238 U (uranium), 40 K (potassium), 232 Th (thorium) and their child nuclei (obtained by radioactive decay of the previous ones) 226 Ra (radio), 222 Rn (radon) and 218 Po (polonium). Nuclei which do not emit radiations naturally are called stable nuclei. In general, most of the nuclei with atomic numbers 1 to 82 are stable nuclei.

## Radioisotopes | What are Radioisotopes? | ANSTO
Radioisotopes. Different isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei but differing numbers of neutrons. Radioisotopes are radioactive isotopes of an element. They can also be defined as atoms that contain an unstable combination of neutrons and protons, or excess energy in their nucleus.

Radioisotopes are commonly used in industry for checking blocked water pipes and detecting leakage in oil pipes. For example, small quantity of radioactive 24 Na is placed in a small enclosed ball and is allowed to move in pipe with water. The moving ball containing radioisotope is monitored with a detector.

## Cobalt
Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal..
