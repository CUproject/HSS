recycled aggregate produced only 0.0024 million ton carbon is produced. Considering the global consumption of 10 billion tons/year of aggregate for concrete production, the carbon footprint can be determined for the natural aggregate as well as for the recycled aggregate. The use of recycled aggregate generally increases

## impact of silica in aggregate crushing
 Â· As a basic rule, impact crushing is suitable for rocks with a low work index (12) as well as low silica (20%) and moisture levels (5%).Rocks with these characteristics are soft and non-abrasive, and easily broken within the crushing chamber, keeping wear rates at a minimum, and producing high reduction ratios with a better-shaped end product.
