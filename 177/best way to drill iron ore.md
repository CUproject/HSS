It is a product quality issue for both the ore supplied and the steel produced from that ore. These impurities are in the form of trace elements within the mined ore. It is therefore as important to sample iron ore correctly at the drilling stage in the same way as it is for a gold mine to sample for gold at the drilling stage.
