## Ore: Generation, Quarrying, and Automatic Mining - Enigmatica
The Orechid and it's cousin the Orechid Ignem represent Botania's solution to generating ore. These use a fair amount of mana to convert nearby blocks, stone and netherrack respectively, to ores. They cover a pretty large area, about an 11 block cube. So don't be surprised if they don't appear to be doing much at first.

## Maryland Mineral Production
Crushed Stone is a form of aggregate, and is a base for making asphault, concrete, macadam, and tarmac. Used extensively to pave and construct roads, crushed stone produced in Maryland in 2021 totaled 28 million metric tons, valued at $377 million. Dimension Stone is any stone that is mined, then altered to required specifications.

Stone quarrying is the multistage process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into the sizes required for immediate use, or for further processing. Mineral processingis the practice of beneficiating valuable minerals from their ores.

## Mine vs. Quarry - What's the difference? | Ask Difference
Quarry. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground. The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to reduce their environmental impact.The word quarry can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.

## Mining, Quarrying, Mineral and Ore Processing, Coal, Iron Ore 
Stone quarrying is the multistage process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into the sizes required for immediate use, or for further processing. Mineral processingis the practice of beneficiating valuable minerals from their ores.
