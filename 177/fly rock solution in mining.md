## Flyrock
Flyrock, or wild flyrock, is rock that is ejected from the blast site in a controlled explosion in mining operations. The term refers in particular to rock that flies beyond the blast site, causing injuries to people and damage to property. This is considered a significant issue in mining; between 1994 and 2005, 32 miners were injured by flyrock.

## fly rock in coal mining
The coal mining process churns up massive quantities of rock, exposing it to air and water for the first time in hundreds of thousands of years. Over time, naturally occurring elements leech out of the rock and run off into our water. This leeching becomes particularly dangerous when certain elements are present.

## 33 Causes, Effects & Solutions for Mining - E&C
One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

##  An Analysis and Prevention of Flyrock Accidents in Surface Blasting 
Blasting is a primary means of extracting minerals and ores at surface mining operations. The domestic  (IME) has defi ned flyrock as th e rock propelled beyond the blast area by the force of an explosion (IME, 1997).

## Optimisation of drilling and blasting focussing on fly rock - SlideShare
Danger and damage from fly rock and rock blasting has been serious problem ever since the introduction of blasting. Fly Rock:- Any mismatch between the distribution of the explosive energy and geo-mechanical strength of rock mass and confinement creates potential for fly rock. Fly rock originates from the vertical highwall face and bench top. 3.

## Prediction of flyrock trajectories for forensic applications using 
Highlights Ballistic flight equations for flyrock throw estimation in post event forensic analysis. Equations are formulated according to Newton's law of motion. An approximate numerical and the 4th order Runge-Kutta solutions are presented. Flyrock throw is determined by plotting the trajectories of the fragments. A case study is given explaining the procedure of equation formulation and
