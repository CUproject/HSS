Nov 21, 2021Find the gape size when the capacity of jaw crushers is 5, the width of crusher is 3 and the closed single setting of jaw crusher is 6. This implies that; C JC = Capacity of Jaw Crushers = 5. W = Width of Crusher = 3. CSS = Closed Single Setting of Jaw Crushers = 6. G = CJC x CSS / W. G = 5 x 6 / 3. G = 30 / 3.

## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers.

However, for the benefit of others, a Nadi amsha is 1/150th part of a rashi. The 30 degrees of rashi divided by 150 would give 12 minutes of arc (30 degrees multiplied by 60 and divided by 150 is equal to 12 minutes). Thus there are 150 Nadi amshas in a rashi and each Nadi amsha is of 12 minutes arc.
