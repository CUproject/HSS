1. Introduction. Jaw and cone crushers are commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry. Today, it is possible to predict the performance of a cone crusher, provided the geometry, crusher settings and the characteristics of the material fed into the crusher are known (Evertsson, 2000).The geometry of the crusher will change because of wear.
