## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

Hematite, the most desirable iron ore because of its high iron content, is found throughout the world, with its highest abundance being seen in Australia, Brazil, and parts of Asia. Since the 1960's, high-grade hematite ore has served as the major source of iron mined in Australia. It comprises 96% of the iron ore exports from that continent.
