## The Fundamentals of Frac Sand Logistics - Hi-Crush
API requires sand to withstand stress of 4,000-6,000 psi. Generally, smaller grains have higher crush strengths and are specified for deeper wells. Testing applies compressive strength to the sand grain. When crush strength is exceeded, the grain breaks and produces pieces, or fines.

## Our iso spec frac sand gradation
The crush resistance k-value frac sand spec the highest stress level at which proppant generates no more than 10% fines. This is an important metric when determining if a new sand source could meet industry-accepted frac sand specs. Additionally, API RP 19C contains specifications for the maximum percentage of fines produced for each mesh size
