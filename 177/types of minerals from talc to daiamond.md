The crystal structure of a natural triclinic talc (1Tc polytype) [with composition: (Mg2.93Fe0.06)Σ2.99(Al0.02Si3.97)Σ3.99O10(OH)2.10] has been investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at 223 and 170 K and by single-crystal neutron diffraction at 20 K. Both the anisotropic X-ray refinements (i.e. at 223 and 170 K) show that the two independent tetrahedra are only slightly distorted
