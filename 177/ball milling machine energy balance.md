## The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution
In terms of this concept, the energy efficiency of the tumbling mill is as low as 1%, or less. For example, Lowrison (1974) reported that for a ball mill, the theoretical energy for size reduction (the free energy of the new surface produced during grinding) is 0.6% of the total energy supplied to the mill setup.
