The technology leaches 97-99 percent copper directly on-site in six to eight hours, from concentrates as low as 5 percent copper. In gold, ROL has the potential to unlock the value of

In this paper, I will detail the methods of the gold extraction process, including gravity separation, flotation, cyanidation, and amalgamation.. The content of gold in the ore is extremely low. In order to extract gold, we need to crush the large ore rock into small pieces first, grind it, and then use appropriate gold processing methods to separate the gold from the ore, get the gold

Smelting is the process by which a metal is obtained either as an element or as a simple compound, from its ore by heating beyond the melting point with the presence of oxidizing agents such as flux. In other words, smelting is the process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. For example, extracting gold from its ore.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.
