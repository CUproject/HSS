Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.

## Effect of Ore Pulp Density and pH Value on Silica in Iron Ore
Iron ore flotation is an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore. Some amount of silicon dioxide is found in the ore even after separation from the magnetic and hydraulic mechanism. The most widely used method of flotation is the reverse cationic flotation route. The low-grade iron ores contain high grades of silica and alumina.

With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.
