## Iron Ore - Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety
Western Australia was the second largest producer of iron ore in 2016 with 769 million tonnes. In volume terms, only China produced more ore, but this material is often very low grade, and is largely accounted for domestically. This leaves Western Australia as the largest supplier to the global seaborne iron ore trade.
