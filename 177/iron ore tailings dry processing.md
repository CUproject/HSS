The complex includes a 16 megawatt power plant. The mill processes 2.0 million metric tons per year (2.2 million short tons per year) of high and low grade iron ore that results in 60-70 dry metric tons per hour (mT/hr) (66-77 short tons per hour) of tailings. Original design of the system was to deal with as much as 150 mT/hr of solids.

## Kalahari Process™ Unlocks Full Potential Of Iron Ore Tailings
Jan 18, 2022Therefore, the company has used the Optima Concentrator™ to develop its so-called Kalahari Process™, which produces an iron ore product with a minimum grade of 63.0% Fe from various iron ore feed sources. The process has seen great success to date by yielding recoveries of up to 80%. In addition, the process is ideally set up for the direct

## Production of Construction Bricks Using Iron Ore Tailings and Clay 
Blocks were prepared using different compositions of iron ore tailings and clay in 70.6 mm cubic moulds. They were sundried and then placed in a furnace at 110 °C for 24 h to remove water. The dry blocks were fired at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1050 °C for 3 h. Characterization of tailings, clay, and sintered blocks was done.
