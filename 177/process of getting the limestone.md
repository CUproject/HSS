## How Does Chemical Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Aug 15, 2022Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
