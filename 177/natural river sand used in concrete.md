M - Sand is the only alternative to river sand. Higher concrete strength compared to river sand used for concreting. Though M Sand uses natural coarse aggregates to form, it causes less damage to the environment as compared to river sand. Better quality control since manufactured in a controlled environment.

Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.

The incorporation of SWSS that alleviates the shortage of freshwater and river sand slightly reduces the mechanical strength of concrete at 28 and 90 days, while the replacement of cement by 35% limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) overcomes this drawback. The compressive strength of concrete is further enhanced, and the pore structure is refined.

Jan 13, 2022River Sand is a natural sand that is made from weathering or erosion processes, unlike other sands that are made from crushing rock. River Sand can vary in gradation but is typically coarse sand. It can be used in all types of landscaping and construction projects including concrete sand, drainage areas, arena footing and soil amendments.
