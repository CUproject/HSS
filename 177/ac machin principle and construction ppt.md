Dec 27, 2020Working Principle of AC Series motor. The working principle is the same as the dc series motor. When the ac series motor connected to the AC supply the alternating current start flowing through the field and armature winding. The field winding produces an alternating flux Φ that reacts with current flowing in armature winding to produce a torque.

A Transformer works on the principle of electric i.e. mutual induction. A Transformer operates when both circuits take effect by mutual induction. A Transformer can't step-up or step-down the level of DC voltage or DC Current. A Transformer only step-up or step-down the level of AC voltage or AC Current.

An AC motor is a motor that converts alternating current into mechanical power. The stator and the rotor are important parts of AC motors. The stator is the stationary part of the motor, and the rotor is the rotating part of the motor. The AC motor may be single-phase or three-phase. Nikola Tesla invented the first AC induction motor in 1887.
