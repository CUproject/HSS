##  Structural and Geochemical Characterization of Gold Mineralized Quartz 
Gold-bearing quartz veins occur in association with metamorphosed rocks ranging in composition from quartz ± gold to those that contain quartz ± gold ± sulphides ± iron-oxides ± sericite and mafic minerals. The mineralized veins contain Au from 0.50 to 25 ppm, while the quartz veins considered barren contain 0.20 ppm Au.

Much of the Gold mined is from large mining operations where the Gold is smeltered for commercial use, and although many commercial gold mines exist, mineral specimens and crystals are hard to come across. China and South Africa have been the worlds two largest Gold producers, but collectors will rarely if ever see a Gold specimen from these countries due to the restrictive nature of the

## Quartz Veins - ROCKS, MINERALS and FOSSILS - Nugget Shooter Forums
Pretty much I guess you would have to just sample to see if it is gold bearing. Out west a quartz vein can be literally surrounded by non-igneous rock that it has intruded up into, but back east it seems more common for a quartz vein to be found in place within a large batholith or surrounded by igneous rock that has been uncovered by erosion

## The gold quartz veins of Grass Valley, California - USGS
The gold quartz veins in the vicinity of Grass Valley, Calif., have been actively mined since the fifties of the nineteenth century. Lindgren mapped the areal geology and studied the mines of the district in 1894, and the accompanying geologic map (pl. 1) is reproduced from his reports. Since then the principal mines have been deepened, many miles of underground workings have been opened, and new

## Vein (geology)
In many gold mines exploited during the gold rushes of the 19th century, vein material alone was typically sought as ore material. In most of today's mines, ore material is primarily composed of the veins and some component of the wall rocks which surrounds the veins.. The difference between 19th-century and 21st-century mining techniques and the type of ore sought is based on the grade of
