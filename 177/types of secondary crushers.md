## Downstream Crushing Options for Secondary, Tertiary and. | McLanahan
Apr 12, 2021These types of crushers are usually applied as tertiary or quaternary crushers with less than 2" (75 mm) feed or smaller. Some Vertical Shaft Impactors can be used as secondary crushers with larger feed. Vertical Shaft Impactors are very application-specific. They are sensitive to abrasive materials and can experience very high maintenance

## How Many Types Does Secondary Crusher Have Available?
You will need a tertiary crusher, which will produce the small sized gravel. In between those two is called a secondary crusher. This machine will create larger types of gravel and aggregate material used for many different purposes. These machines come in many different types and styles, including those that are both stationary and portable.

An impact crusher uses mass and velocity to break down feed material. First, the feed material is reduced as it enters the crusher and makes contact with the rotating blow bars or hammers in the rotor. Secondary breakage then occurs as the material is accelerated into the stationary aprons or breaker plates.

A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

## Secondary Impact Crushers » MTM Crushing and Screening
Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm.
