Feb 13, 2011 This paper present a report on the possibility of developing high performance concrete (HPC) using quarry dust as part of fine aggregates. Quarry dust was used to replace 20% of sand in silica fume-quarry dust (SFQD) and silica fume (SF) concretes. Besides, silica fume was used as 10% replacement of cement in both SF and SFQD concretes.

## Investigation of Engineering Properties of Quarry Waste in the East of 
At the East of Thailand, a shortage of river sand for producing concrete has frequently occurred while the large amounts of quarry dusts are being produced as by-products of stone crushers in many stone quarries. Then, the quarry waste from 12 stone quarries (in Rayong and Chonburi province) was taken to investigate the engineering properties as fine aggregate for concrete.

## Quarry fines: an ideal material for the manufacture of  - SpringerLink
Oct 8, 2020Most of the quarry dust is formed while devastating, crushing and screening of extracted rock to make fine aggregate and other products. Thus, quarry dust or quarry fines refer to undersized material or a residue/tailing material subsequent to the mining and dispensation of rocks to develop tiny aggregates, whose sizes are below 4.75 mm.
