## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

Offshore sand and gravel extraction involves the abstraction of sediments from a bed which is always covered with seawater. This activity started in the early 20th century (in the mid-1920s, in the United Kingdom), but did not reach a significant scale until the 1960s and 1970s, when markets for marine sand and gravel expanded and dredging technology improved (Fig. 1).

## River Sand Mining and Mining Methods | SpringerLink
A variety of methods are adopted for alluvial sand extraction. Kondolf et al. described several methods for the extraction of sand from the active channels and floodplain/terraces of riverine environments.3.3.1 Active Channels. Instream sand and gravel mining (Plate 3.2) has been carried out by the following methods: (a) Bar scalping or skimming. Bar scalping or skimming is the extraction of

## State DEC poised to approve sand and gravel mining 89 feet into 
Oct 27, 2020CMA is currently mining sand and gravel on 14.9 acres of the site, which adjoins the town's capped landfill. CMA is not seeking to expand the mine footprint laterally but rather is seeking to expand it vertically, digging a 100-foot-deep, 8.5-acre lake on the site. Using a hydraulic dredge, it will mine to a depth of 89 feet below the

## State-of-the Art: Sand and Gravel Industry - US EPA
Improved technology, more massive equipment, and greater demand is resulting in the economic exploration of lower grade sand and gravel deposits, thus increasing the ratio of acres disturbed per ton of sand and gravel produced. With the mining of this commodity expected to double by 1980, and increase three to four times by the year 2000, the
