Jan 1, 2022Thus Quarry Dust (QD) and M−Sand (MS) are tested and found to be the alternatives to river sand. QD is a byproduct generated from quarrying activities involved in the production of crushed coarse aggregate. It is possible to use QD and MS as a FA in concrete which satisfies the role of river sand and will also reduce environmental imbalance

## Benefits of Quarry Dust in Construction - North Hills Co. Ltd.
Using quarry dust is environmentally friendly and available. Quarry dust is much more accessible and available than regular sand for construction. Regular sand is mined from the river bed but quarry dust is a by-product of stone chippings and a good replacement for sand. Using quarry dust saves the environment by preventing sand mining.

Natural sands such as river sand, marine sand, quarry dust and dune sand have their own drawbacks. For instance, marine sand has a high percentage of salt [19-21]; quarry sand has a large amount of fines/dust; and because of the loosely packed soil particles, dune sand is unfit to be used in concrete.

## Shear Strength of Rock Quarry Dust and Sand Mix | SpringerLink
Hence shear parameters of rock quarry dust and sand mix are found out at different dry unit weight of the sample by direct shear test. The quarry dust and sand mix were taken with different dry unit weights like 12.17 kN/m 3, 16.71 kN/m 3, and 19.62 kN/m 3 at different strain rates of 0.25 mm/min, 0.625 mm/min, and 1.25 mm/min, respectively.
