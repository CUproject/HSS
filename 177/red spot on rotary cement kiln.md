## Hot Spots In Cement Kiln
Cement Rotary Kiln. Answer-2: hot spot is isolated area on the kiln shell with abnormally high temperature. it is quickly detected by a shell scanner or with a portable infra-red pyrometer. it can't be seen during the day, and can hardly be seen at night (figure-2). therefore, based on the visible radiation spectrum for hot surfaces, their maximum temperature must be below 550.

Put cement clinker into the cooling machine after it is ejected from the kiln head hood. A dry rotary kiln makes the raw material into raw powder, whose water content is less than one percent. The advantage is that it saves more energy than a wet rotary kiln. The disadvantage is that it may happen that the ingredient in mixed material is uneven.

If there is any persistent red spot covering more than 10% of the kiln circumference (figure-4); Kiln should stop immediately. 3. Kiln alignment conditions: Misaligned kilns induce localized stresses along the kiln length. If the red spot coincides with an area of stress concentration, the shell sometimes elongates or twists beyond recovery. 4.
