## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

## Hammer or roller mill and dry Vs wet milling — Feed Machinery 
So i want to know which mill will be preferable in terms of initial cost and operationgcost (i,e. power consumption, manpower). Also i want to compare which method is good dry miling or wet milling in the similar aspects as mentioned above. One of typical application is - Particle size distribution requiredis-Upto 0.3 mm - 10 to 20%

## Dry Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Dry milling is carried out using a roller, disk, or hammer mills. Roller mills are used when wort separation is carried out with a lauter tun, while hammer (or disk) mills are used when mash filtration is applied. Wet milling may also be applied as it has been established by the corn starch industry. 9.2.2.2 Mashing
