## Thermal behavior of kiln cars while traveling through a tunnel kiln 
In this work, the total length of tunnel kiln is 160 m, which includes 50 m of preheating zone, 30 m of firing zone, and 80 m of cooling zone. There are 20 cars traveling through the tunnel kiln. Because the operation of kiln cars is a continuous process, kiln cars are treated as sequential layers.

## Thermal Analysis and Energy Efficiency Improvements in Tunnel Kiln for 
Kiln is a prime need in the ceramics industry, where energy loss is a major part which consumes about 60% production cost through thermal energy for different applications. Higher density of fired and tunnel kiln refractory material lowers the thermal diffusivity and the proper selection of fired material minimizes the energy loss along the kiln.

An in-depth thermodynamic analysis of modern high-temperature tunnel kilns showed that the principal exergy losses in the kilns are due to the irreversibility of the kiln processes and the imperfect design of the roof. In the 0.75-m-high kiln the internal exergy losses can be reduced by shortening the heating zone and improving the sealing of the kiln floor, and in the 1.1-m-high kiln by
