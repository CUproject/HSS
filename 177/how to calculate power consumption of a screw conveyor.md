## how to calculate power in a nveyor
Jan 17, 2022Calculating Power required to drive a conveyor  From your 3000Tonnes per hour and a given length of conveyor belt you can work out the power required to shift that amount from :- (3000/3600)2m  9.81 = 16.35kw I have assumed the 2m is conveyor length, as a length is not given, you then need to add the power to turn the conveyor and gearbox at correct speeds which will of course

## Screw Conveyor Torque Requirements - Eng-Tips Forums
I want to use a screw conveyor to level loads in bins containing materials such as grain, wood chips, plastic resins. Would like to know how to calculate the required torque. azertyuiop (Mechanical) 12 Jun 03 10:37. a) first possibility : P = G x L x F1 / 367. G = weight in metric ton per hour. L = screw length in meter.
