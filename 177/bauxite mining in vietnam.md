The controversy over a chinese-invested bauxite mine in the central highlands crystallizes this issue. To many observers the mining plan makes no economic or environmental sense. The $15 billion project entails Vietnam mining bauxite ore and refining it into alumina%u2014a low-margin input for aluminum via a highly toxic process.

We are seeing the same thing happening in Vietnam, India, Brazil, Guinea and other bauxite-producing nations," the Minister noted. Mr. Paulwell said the realisation is that as long as Jamaica continues to sell its ore to producers, "all we

As Vietnam's 11th Party Congress kicked off last week in Hanoi, those critics wondered if their concerns might finally be heard. Plans to mine the remote highlands for bauxite were first broached by the former Soviet Union, but the project was eventually dismissed due to environmental concerns. But in 2006, China signed a framework agreement

## Overview of mining industry in Vietnam - VietnamCredit
The mining industry in Vietnam took a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. After seven months of 2021, the IIP of the mining industry decreased by 6.3%, of which crude oil and natural extraction fell by 10.4%. Some provinces strong in mining, such as Thai Nguyen, Quang Ninh, Lam Dong, etc., reported negative growth in the first six months of 2021.

## Vietnam bauxite plan opens pit of concern - Mines and Communities
Because Vietnam faces mounting power shortages, the economics of bauxite mining and its low- margin exports are in doubt and will likely require heavy state subsidies just to cover costs. The government has already announced plans to build a dedicated rail line to transport the produced alumina 250 kilometers to the Pacific coast.

## Bauxite mining in the United States
Bauxite forms by the weathering of aluminum-rich and silica-poor rocks in hot, humid, climates, at places with good drainage. Under the proper conditions, weathering disintegrates the aluminium silicate minerals, and dissolves and removes the silica, creating bauxite. The mined US bauxite deposits have all been in the southeastern United States.
