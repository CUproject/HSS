## Copper Electrolytic Plant
The refining anodes taken out from the refining furnace is changed into electrolytic copper with purity of 99.99% through an electrolysis process: During electrolysis, copper (II) ions leave the impure copper anode and since they are positive, migrating to the negative cathode. From time to time, the pure copper is scraped off the cathode.

## Copper Purification Process - Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant
Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pure—up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide

## Scale-Up and Operating Factors for Electrolytic Silver Recovery from 
The traditional copper displacement method for silver recovery does not consume electrical energy, and is therefore perceived to have a lower energy cost compared to the electrolytic method. However, the added cost for the treatment of the resulting copper-rich byproduct in order to comply with government effluent standards needs to be factored

## How to Recover Copper from Solution - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
A soluble chloride is added to the sulphate solution of copper and the proper amount of sulphurous acid is added. Moderate heat under pressure—90° C. of heat—precipitated almost all the copper as sub-chloride. The subsequent process of obtaining the copper without volatilization and the recovery of the chlorine offered difficulties.
