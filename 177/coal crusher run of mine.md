## Selective Crushing of Run-of-Mine as an Important Part of the Hard Coal 
To obtain commercial product of required quantitative and qualitative parameters, hard coal must be subjected to a number of processing operations. Preliminary stone removal from run-of-mine is one of them. Methods of such removal, including the method of selective crushing are described. Design solutions for a KOMAG-type device for dry stone removal of run-of-mine are presented.

Coal production line also known as coalbeneficiation plant or coal washing plant. It refers to the processing operation of run-of-mine coal to improve coalquality and to enhance its suitability forfinal applications.The coal production line design depends on the properties ofthe coal and its final use.
