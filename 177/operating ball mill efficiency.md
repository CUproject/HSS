## Temperature Reduction for Ball Mill Optimization | Lechler US
Heat taken away by ventilation systems can accounts for roughly 20% of the total heat discharged by the ball mill. Improving that ventilation system brings more cool air into the inside of the ball bill, gradually reducing the internal temperature. However, the major benefit of using ball mills is the product fineness they can deliver.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.

## operating mill efficiency
operating ball mill efficiency. operating ball mill efficiency kenya Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals The rods used in the mill usually a high carbon steel can vary in both the length and the diameter However the smaller the rods the larger is the total surface area and hence the greater the grinding efficiency Autogenous mill
