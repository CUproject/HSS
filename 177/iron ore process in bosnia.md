## HYL Process for Direct Reduction of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
HYL process is designed for the conversion of iron ore (pellet/lump ore) into metallic iron, by the use of reducing gases in a solid-gas moving bed reactor. Oxygen (O2) is removed from the iron ore by chemical reactions based on hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) for the production of highly metallized direct reduced iron (DRI)/hot

Pelletizing of iron ore is a method of Swedish origin, patented in 1912 by AG Andersson (Yamaguchi et al., 2010). The process was developed in the USA in the 1940s, and the first commercial plant started operation in Babbitt, Minnesota in 1952. The first iron ore pellet plant of the grate-kiln type was established at Humboldt Mine, Michigan in

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
