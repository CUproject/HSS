## Copper ore processing technology development and research in China 
There are two main copper ore processing methods, flotation and hydrometallurgical process. In terms of process improvement, the current research mainly focuses on the research of fast flotation, early removal of waste, reduction of overgrinding and undergrinding, etc. At the same time, the joint process is also the focus of current research.

## copper processing - Ores | Britannica
Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to
