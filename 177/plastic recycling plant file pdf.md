##  Mechanical recycling of plastic packaging waste
The largest plastics market is packaging and accounts for approx. 40 % of the total plastics production. Packaging materials are short-lived and are usually discarded within one year, in contrast to plastics used in e.g. automotive applications. The recycling of plastic packaging waste is therefore essential for a sustainable society.

The European Union has set a target of only 10% of plastic waste to landfill by 2030, compared to around 30% at present. Taxes on incineration are also being increasingly used to limit this form of waste processing. 34 But recycling can only develop where appropriate infrastructure and collection rules are in place.

1. Land Requirement: $120,000 - $1,000,000. The demand of land depends on what scale your plant will operate. If you choose to operate a small scale recycling plant, then a 50 sq. feet room can also work. But if you choose a large scale recycling plant, then at least 200 to 500 sq. feet of land is required for the recycling process.

## Recycling and the future of the plastics industry | McKinsey
Our projections suggest that mechanical recycling rates could increase from the current level of 12 percent of total plastics volumes to 15 to 20 percent 2 of the much larger projected total plastics output by 2030, assuming oil prices of $75 per barrel. Under a scenario where oil prices move below $65 a barrel, the economics of mechanical
