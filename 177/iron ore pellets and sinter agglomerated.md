## Iron Ore Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The term induration describes the hardening of a powdery substance. For example, in steel production, iron ore pellets are fed into melt furnaces. To avoid dusting and loss of ore, small oxide particles are agglomerated by sintering. Although initially applied to iron ore, soon the briquette agglomeration concept spread to a variety of
