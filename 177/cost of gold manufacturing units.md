Therefore, for these 2,000 additional units, the incremental manufacturing cost per unit of product will be an average of $20 ($40,000 divided by 2,000 units). The reason for the relatively small incremental cost per unit is due to the cost behavior of certain costs. For example, when the 2,000 additional units are manufactured most fixed costs

As a production capacity increase would only affect variable costs, the average variable cost per unit in this scenario would be $65,000/400 = $162.50. That means producing one more bicycle would cost an extra $162.50, which is noticeably lower than the average cost.

## Manufacturing Cost - The Strategic CFO®
To find the manufacturing cost per unit formula, simply divide the above results by the number of units produced. Manufacturing Cost Calculation. Performing manufacturing cost calculations are simple once the essential data is available. If: Labor = $100,000 Materials = $75,000 Overhead = $200,000. Then: MC = $100,000 + $75,000 + $200,000
