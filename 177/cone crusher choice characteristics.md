## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

## Chamber Optimization for Comprehensive Improvement of Cone Crusher 
Mar 15, 2021Finally, based on the iron ore coarsely crushed by the gyratory crusher, the dynamic characteristics of the C900 cone crusher were simulated by using the discrete element method (DEM), and the simulation results are basically consistent with the numerical analysis results. Results show that considering the amount of ore uplift in the blockage
