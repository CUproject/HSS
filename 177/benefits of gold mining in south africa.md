Roots of Apartheid: South Africa's Mining Industry. The gold mine owners faced three challenges to maximizing their profits: the gold deposits, although vast, were deep in the ground; the ore was low-grade; the price of gold was set internationally, so the gold companies could not simply pass on the costs of extracting and refining vast amounts of ore to consumers.

But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.
