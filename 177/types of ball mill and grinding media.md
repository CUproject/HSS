Jun 14, 2022The ZrSiO4 grinding media ball is a ZrSiO4 ceramic ball prepared from ZrSiO4 as the main raw material, and its ZrO2 mass fraction is 65%-68% or lower. ZrSiO 4 ceramic balls are mainly used for ultra-fine grinding of ZrSiO4 raw materials, which can increase the content of ZrSiO 4, but their high wear and low strength limit their application.

## Size Distribution of Grinding Media (Balls) in a Mill
It is obvious from the positions of the different sizes ofgrinding media balls within the charge that mill speed is a major factor. At low speed, all the large (white) balls are found at the periphery of the charge. At high speed, they are in the centre. This applies to all types of grinding media, e.g. pebbles, ball or rods.

To minimise over-grinding modern ball mills are fitted with dynamic separators (otherwise described as 'classifiers' or more simply as 'separators'). The working principle is that cement is removed from the mill before over-grinding has taken place.  In this type of mill, the ball-milling media have considerably high energy, because
