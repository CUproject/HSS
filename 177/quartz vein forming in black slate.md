## Planes of weakness: Quartz veins - Heart of Avalonia
Planes of weakness: Quartz veins. Many common rock-forming minerals contain hydrogen and when rocks containing hydrogen-bearing minerals are subjected to increasing temperature or decreasing pressure, water can be released. Release of water from hydrated minerals occurs when magma flows upwards, when magma heats surrounding rocks or when

Hot watery solutions, also known as hydrothermal environments, are a hotbed for quartz crystals in their purest forms. The hydrothermal process takes place at temperatures between 100°C and 450°C and requires high pressures to form the quartz crystals fully. [SinOm]-OH + H4SiO4 → [Sin+1Om+2]-OH + 2 H2O.

My simple answer is a light colored rock formation which consist of large crystals of feldspar,quartz and mica.But that is a simple explanation of a common pegmatite and pegmatites can be far from common in many cases.So even in a common pegmatite there is feldspar,quartz and mica,still simple until you understand the feldspar may be microcline

Rock Contact Zones and Faults: Many quartz veins and other hard rock gold deposits occur in "zones" along faults or at the contact of two different types of rock.

## Common Beach Stone Identification (Including Dolomite, Quartz 
Jul 22, 2022Rhyolite. Rhyolite is a felsic (silica-rich) volcanic igneous rock with the same mineral content as granite, only unlike granite, it cools fast from the molten rock near or over the surface of Earth's crust (extrusive type).When these magmas erupt, a rock with two grain sizes typically forms. The larger crystals that form just beneath the surface cool at a slower pace and are known as phenocrysts.

They may have originated in many different ways and present a great variety of forms and structures. We may classify them in three groups: (i.) veins of igneous rock, (ii.) of sedimentary, and (iii.) of minerals deposited by water or by gases.

Mineral Veins. One of the most exciting places to find quartz crystals is in quartz veins. These veins run through various types of rock and can contain large, high quality crystals. You can find them in both igneous and sedimentary rock, which means that you can probably find one fairly close to you regardless of where you live.

## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.
