There is no specific depth at which gold can be found. Examples of this are the Welcome Stranger - the largest gold nugget ever found - which was retrieved at only 3cm (1.18in) below the surface.

## Finding the Ore Liberation Size For Gravity Circuits: Sizing-Sorting 
Tune the grinding circuit to only grind fine enough to attain the commercially-viable liberation size. If gold is found in the or <325 mesh fractions, it is likely gold-bearing sulfides or free milling gold <~400 mesh. This gold is not practical to recover via gravity concentration, so flotation or leaching could be used. Additional notes
