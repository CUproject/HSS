## Using Limestone in Construction - Stamford Stone
Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock, made up mostly from minerals calcite and aragonite. It is mainly composed of the skeletal fragments of a number of marine organisms like molluscs, corals and forams, and about 10% sedimentary rocks are limestone. Limestone is made up from rocks which were formed in the seas millions of years ago.

## Common Uses For Limestone | What Can Lime Be Used For?
Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.

May 18, 2022Lime neutralizes soil acid levels. If you add too much limestone gravel to your garden or lawn, it won't kill your plants immediately. However, too much lime will slowly impact your soil chemistry. When this happens, it reduces the mineral nutrients that your plants need to live.
