## Concentration of Ore - Definition, Methods of Separation, Examples
Nov 28, 2021The concentration of ore, also known as ore enrichment, is the process of removing gangue particles from ore in order to enhance the percentage of metal in the ore. The difference in physical or chemical properties of the ore and the impurities determines the procedures used to remove impurities from the ores.

## concentration process of iron
The concentration of ore can is the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore for the extraction of metal.  An iron concentration of as little as 0.3 milligrams per l (mg/l) may be sufficient to produce reddish brown sediment. Iron is not generally harmful at this level, so an unhealthy level

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview | IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.
