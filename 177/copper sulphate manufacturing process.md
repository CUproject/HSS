Make Copper Sulfate. Fill a jar or beaker with 5 ml concentrated sulfuric acid and 30 ml of water. If your sulfuric acid solution is already diluted, add less water. Set two copper wires into the solution so that they are not touching each other. Connect the wires to a 6-volt battery. The solution will turn blue as copper sulfate is produced.
