## Common Coal Mining and Processing Terms
Coal Washing. Coal washing is a process designed to separate the coal particles based on size, density and shape. Achieved by allowing the coal to settle in the wash fluid. Continuous Mining. Continuous Mining is an underground method of extracting coal. The process utilises a machine that is capable of handling the entire extraction process.

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Mine development. Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. In open-pit coal mining, a pit is dug in an area and this pit becomes the open-pit mine, sometimes called a quarry. Open-pit mines can expand to huge dimensions, until the coal deposit has been mined or the cost of transporting becomes too great.

## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained | Anglo American
The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.

## What is Open Cut Mining? | Bravus Mining & Resources
Nov 30, 2021Open-cut mining is a process of resource extraction where it is dug up from the surface. Also known as open-pit mining or open-cast mining, it is the most common form of extraction for minerals or coal in Australia. The technique of open-cut mining is used when the deposits are close enough to the surface to be readily extracted.

Coal and petroleum were formed from the remains of dead animals and plants that underwent different biological and geological processes. Coal is the remnants of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived several million years ago. Earthquakes or volcanic eruptions have crushed these.

Two dominant methods account for the vast majority of underground coal mining: "room and pillar" and "longwall" mining.. In room and pillar mining, seams of coal are partially mined, leaving large pillars of coal intact to support the overlying layers of rock. When finished, miners practice "retreat" mining, extracting as much coal as possible from the remaining pillars as they

This process is commonly called 'coalification'. Coal occurs as layers or seams, ranging in thickness from millimetres to many tens of metres. It is composed mostly of carbon (50-98 per cent), hydrogen (3-13 per cent) and oxygen, and smaller amounts of nitrogen, sulphur and other elements. It also contains water and particles of other

## Underground mining - block caving, bore hole, drift fill, hard rock
Retreat mining is a process that recovers the supporting coal pillars, working from the back of the mine towards the entrance, hence the word retreat.Room and pillar mining advances inward, away from the entrance of the mine. Other underground mining methods include Hard rock mining, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope

## Mining Water Use | U.S. Geological Survey
Mining water use is water used for the extraction of minerals that may be in the form of solids, such as coal, iron, sand, and gravel; liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas. The category includes quarrying, milling of mined materials, injection of water for secondary oil recovery or for unconventional oil and gas recovery (such as hydraulic fracturing), and other
