## Working principle of small glass crusher machine
On the center shaft of the small glass crusher machine, there are many hammers.When the glass bottle crusher is working, the motor makes the center shaft rotate in high speed. As a result, the hammers also are rotating in high speed. The glass bottles are crushed into small pieces by the high speed rotating hammers.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the
