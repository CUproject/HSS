Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.
