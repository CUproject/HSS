Nickel resists corrosion and is used to plate other metals to protect them. It is, however, mainly used in making alloys such as stainless steel. Nichrome is an alloy of nickel and chromium with small amounts of silicon, manganese and iron. It resists corrosion, even when red hot, so is used in toasters and electric ovens.

## Nickel: Hidden in Plain Sight | Dartmouth Toxic Metals
Nickel is a transition metal that forms alloys with a host of other transition metals such as copper, zinc, iron, silver, cadmium and chromium. It is both strong — it resists fracture under high stress — and ductile — it bends rather than cracking under stress. This is a valuable combination of properties.
