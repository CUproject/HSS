Jan 25, 2022Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

Copper values are efficiently recovered from a copper ore, including secondary sulfides, by first crushing the ore to a particle size P-80 of about 1 to 2 inches, then grinding the so crushed ore to a particle size P-80 of between Tyler 4 mesh and 20 mesh, and then classifying the ground ore into a fines fraction of less than 65 mesh and one or more coarse fractions of more than 65 mesh.

## Secondary Copper Ore Recovery
Secondary Copper Ore Recovery . In this work, the parameters affecting the recovery of copper from the low-grade sulfide minerals of Sarcheshmeh Copper Mine were studied. A low-grade sulfide ore was used with a copper grade of 0.25, which was about 28 of the mineral oxide, and the sulfide minerals made up the rest. Much more sulfide.

The model equations are estimated for the U.S. secondary copper industry and used to assess the impacts that various policies and future events have on copper recycling rates.
