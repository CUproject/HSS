This 20 mm coal is then fed into the raw coal bunker from where it goes to the coal mill .The rate of feeding of coal is controlled by raw coal feeder. • The coal mill pulverizes the coal i.e. it crushes the coal into a tiny sized particles which are similar to that of talcum powder. It is done to avoid incomplete combustion of Coal Processing

Coal dust is a fine powdered form of which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverizing of coal. Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.. Grinding coal to dust before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning and makes the coal easier to handle.

The adsorption of moisture on a dry coal surface is an exothermic process, with a heat producing reaction. If it is partially dried during its mining, storage, or processing, coal has the potential to readsorb moisture, thus producing heat. Therefore, the higher the moisture content of the coal, the greater the potential for this to occur.

Mechanically pulverizing coal into a fine powder enables it to be burned like a gas, thus allowing more efficient combustion. Transported by an air or an air/gas mixture, pulverized coal can be introduced directly into the boiler for combustion. There are several pieces of equipment involved in processing coal to be burned in this fashion.

## coal powder particles process equipment
A process is disclosed for conversion of coal powder of 4 micron size into a finer powder of the order of 1/400 micron by passing through a vertical tube of sufficient length at a temperature of -77° C and thereafter passing through a second chamber by force of gravity where a counter stream of heated nitrogen at 780° C causes the powder to
