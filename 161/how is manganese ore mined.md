## Manganese Alloy | Assmang Proprietary Limited
Introduction. In order to beneficiate the manganese ore from their mines in the Northern Cape, Assmang established Cato Ridge Works (formerly Feralloys Limited) in 1956 and construction was started on a ferro manganese smelter at Cato Ridge approximately 60km from Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. The first alloy from this plant was exported in 1959.

## Manganese: Nodules, Uses, Facts, Ore, Alloys, Metal - Geology
Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron. It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel. As an alloy, it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength. The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Manganese Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Manganese Ore. Manganese ore bodies generally have experienced supergene alteration that has produced new sets of minerals, and, via the removal of carbonate, produced higher grades of ore (Varentsov, 1996).  Manganese ore was mined from 1950 to 1971, most production being from Viti Levu in the 1950s. Magnetite was mined at Tuveriki in south

## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
