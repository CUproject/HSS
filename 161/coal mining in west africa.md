Mining in West Africa is an important source of gold, iron ore, uranium and diamonds. The region is also rich in aluminium, nickel, phosphate, manganese and zinc. Most of the mineral wealth in this region remains undeveloped, meaning West Africa's importance in the global mineral economy will increase in the future.
