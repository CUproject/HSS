## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon and other elements. According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent).

The iron ore in this area contains a large volume of fines (20-30% below 150 μm), which can be transformed by high moisture content into a sticky mass that is almost impossible to screen. Vale initially considered wet-process screening using water sprays to overcome the problem but ultimately rejected that approach as too costly.
