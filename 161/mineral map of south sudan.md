## Sudan: Mining, Minerals and Fuel Resources
Experts from the international mining sector believe that South Sudan is most likely to have several untapped mineral and metal resources such as gold, copper, uranium, and iron ore. In 2010, the oil sector of Sudan accounted for 7.5% of the GDP, and the mining and quarrying sector accounted for 0.2%. Crude petroleum exports were valued at $9.

South Sudan is suited for agriculture, but productivity is low. South Sudan's oil wealth gives rise to a deceptively high per capita GDP. Preliminary estimates for 2011 indicate a GDP per capita of US $1,858, which is much higher than South Sudan's East African neighbours. Very little of this wealth, however, trickles down to the average
