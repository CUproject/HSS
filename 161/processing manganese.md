Manganese is an essential mineral. It's needed by the body in very small amounts. It's important in building bone, healing wounds, and in how the body uses carbohydrates and amino acids. Manganese is concentrated in the mitochondria of cells. Most of it is found in the bone, liver, pancreas, and kidney cells.

## Novel processing of iron-manganese alloy-based biomaterials by inkjet 3 
Abstract. The present work provides an assessment of 3-D printed iron-manganese biodegradable scaffolds as a bone scaffold material. Iron-based alloys have been investigated due to their high strength and ability to slowly corrode. Current fabrications of Fe-based materials generate raw material which must be machined into their desired form.

Manganese processing Britannica Know More. Manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products Manganese Mn is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 176 C 2,271 176 F Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such

## Manganese Ore Process Plant - JXSC Mineral
Manganese is a silvery-gray metal that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in the air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen. The two main manganese minerals are pyrolusite (MnO2
