Ceramic powder processing consists of powder production by milling/grinding, followed by fabrication of green product, which is then consolidated to obtain the final product. A powder is a collection of fine particles. Synthesis of powder involves getting it ready for shaping by crushing, grinding, separating impurities, blending different powders, drying to form soft agglomerates.

The metal powder is usually an aggregate of metal particles of less than 1 mm, and there is no uniform regulation of the division of the particle size interval.. Commonly used methods are as follows: particles between 1000~50μm are conventional powder; 50~10μm is a fine powder; 10~0.5μm is a very fine powder; <0.5μm is an ultrafine powder; 0.1~100nm is nanopowder.
