Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods, depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal is produced from opencut mines.

National mapping reveals that 37.3% of Australia is covered by coal and gas licences and applications. That amounts to 285 million hectares - an area almost 13 times the size of Great Britain! Our best food-producing lands, our finest natural areas and some of our most important water resources are all at risk from unsafe coal and gas mining.

Known as coking coal or metallurgical coal. In NSW this high-quality coal is primarily mined in the Southern Coalfields of NSW, in the Illawarra region south of Sydney. This coal is used to create coke, one of the key inputs for the production of steel, alongside iron ore. In NSW, local coking coal is used to supply the Port Kembla Steelworks
