## Brick compressive strength testiehillfo
Compressive strength test on bricks: In this test, Brick is placed in compression testing machine and then load is applied in brick until it breaks.At a point it breaks, the value of failure load is noted and the crushing strength of brick is calculated.The minimum crushing strength of brick is 3.5 N/mm2.

## Stone Crushing - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Oct 20, 2020The crushing-strength test is not practiced as a rule except on stone intended for building purposes. The fact is that most rocks have adequate compressive resistance for structural purposes. Crushed stone does not lend itself to the compression test very readily unless the sample is taken from the ledge rock before it is crushed.
