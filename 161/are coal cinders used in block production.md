## Is coal ash safe to use on roads? Some experts are not so sure
Tom Adams, executive director of the American Coal Ash Association, dismisses the bottom ash used on roadways as mere "coal dirt.". And although it harbors varying amounts of toxic heavy metals including arsenic, lead, chromium and cadmium, Adams says the amounts are no higher than in the rock and dirt native to many areas of the country.

## Cinder Block vs. Concrete Block. Differences, Pros & Cons - Engineering Web
Cinder blocks are old-fashioned construction units, pre-dating the concrete blocks we're familiar with today. They're not widely used anymore. What is it made of? Cinder blocks are made of cement, water, and a generous portion of coal cinders, hence the name. These blocks are far lighter than concrete blocks and aren't very robust.

## Can I use cinder blocks for shed foundation?
You should wet the blocks for two reasons. The first is to lubricate the blocks so they go down easier. The second is so the blocks will have a minimum of 1/2″ of wet mortar on top of them when the next course of blocks is laid. This 1/2″ will disguise any irregularities on the face of the block below it.

Dec 2, 2020The coal cinder ingredients make cinder blocks lighter as compared to traditional concrete hollow blocks however they don't have the same load-bearing ability or tensile strength.. Cinder Blocks. Usually made of cement and coal cinders.; Much lighter when compared with the concrete hollow blocks because of the proportion of the aggregate ingredients.

## Building a forge with cinder blocks? : r/Blacksmith - reddit
Once it dried the space was filled with coal ash for insulation, and the firepot built above it by lining one of the blocks with a clay-like mud displaced by the building it was being constructed in.  Cinder blocks can be used structurally to build a permanent forge but they must be isolated from the most intense heat of the forge. You

## Cinder Blocks vs. Construction Blocks; What?s the Difference? - MM Concrete
Apr 23, 2021CONSTRUCTION BLOCKS. After WWII, better technology and production habits put an end to the production of cinder. Now, manufactures use the byproducts called fly ash and slag made from coal and steel to make these blocks. These are much safer than cinder and incorporating them in to block minimizes the carbon impact today.
