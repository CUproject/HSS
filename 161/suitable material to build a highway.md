## Earthworks Materials Used for Highway Construction
Multiple construction methods can be used to process rock and soil into aggregates: crushing, blasting, washing, excavating, dredging, and screening. When the composition of the grains or fragments has not been altered, then it is considered a natural material. These natural aggregates are commonly used for highways and other construction projects.

The target density of the top 2 feet of the embankment can be achieved by using a suitable material that is compacted. Avoid the use of shale or shale-like material for this area of the embankment. If the embankment depth is greater than 5 feet and is composed of rock, then the deposited rock should not exceed the size of the material being placed.

## Road Construction with Expansive Clays - Substrata
It also causes large issues post construction in the event water or another liquid seeps into the soil, this often causes massive failures on the topcoat (i.e. asphalt, concrete, etc) because the base has shifted so much and moved the rigid layer of the topcoat. Construction with expansive clays is very challenging whether it be for unpaved

## Selection of Material in Construction of Equipment | SMT - Smart Machine
Jul 26, 2022Metals (iron, aluminum, copper, magnesium), composites, liquids, gases, polymers ( rubber, plastics), and even ceramics (glass, semi-conductors, structural ceramics, refractory composites) all find their way into the production of equipment. Equipment being made with metals tend to be more basic, while those using some of these alternatives

##  Highway Shoulders Construction Practices - Transportation Research Board
For initial compaction of the stabilized shoulder material, specifications permit the use of any suitable equipment approved by the engineer. For final compaction of the surface of the stabilized shoulder, the use of approved pneumatic tired equipment is required (Figure 6). Moisture-density principles are used in compaction control.
