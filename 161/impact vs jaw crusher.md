## Impact Crushers VS Jaw Crushers
Compared with the impact crushers, jaw crushers use the compression force to break down materials. When the material is poured into the chamber and fall though chamber, it will be crushed 2 to 4 times. The reduction ratio of this machine is about 6:1. Besides the higher reduction ratios, the impact crushers is more useful to make a more cubical
