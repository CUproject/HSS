## Impact Crushers | Weir
What is an Impact Crusher? Compared to the compression style of crushing, impact crushing crushes rocks at high-speed with a rotor that hits and throws the rocks into the curtain or apron which further reduces particle size.. Given that the inserted rotors (VSI and HSI) operate at high speeds, impact crushers are best suited to materials with a low work index (low hardness), low silica levels

## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits - Quarry
Many modern impact crusher installations have a variable speed drive arrangement that allows an increase in the rotor speed to compensate for wear on the impact hammers. In many impact crushers, a third curtain or crushing chamber can be added to increase reduction in every pass through the machine.

## C Series Impact Crusher-MECRU
The impact crusher uses impact energy to crush materials. When working, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at a high speed. When the material enters the action area of the hammer, it strikes and breaks with the hammer on the rotor, and then is thrown to the counterattack device to be broken again. And then rebounds from the counterback
