The ratio of waste to clay is variable, but overall is in the order of 1 to 1.5. Ball clay undergoes limited processing. Most is size reduced and some 70% is sold in this form. This allows the clays to be more easily handled and blended. The blending being essential to optimise clay use and to consistently meet customer specifications.

A process flow diagram for kaolin mining and dry processing is presented in Figure 11.25-1, and Figure 11.25-2 illustrates the wet processing of kaolin. In the dry process, the raw material is crushed to the desired size, dried in rotary dryers, pulverized and air-floated to remove most of the coarse grit. Wet processing of kaolin begins with

The particles range in size from submicron to as much as 40 microns (equivalent spherical diameter). The kaolin is mined with diesel or electric shovels or draglines and loaded in trucks for transport to the processing plant or dropped directly from the dragline into a blunger. The blunger chews the kaolin into small lumps and mixes it with
