## Specialty Concrete AdMixtures for Custom Colored Concrete - ClarkeColors
An admixture designed for colored concrete should accomplish two goals. The first is to reduce the excess water required for flow and to fill molds. The second is to KEEP the water that has been added inside the body of the concrete to allow it to completely react and convert to the multi silicate structures.
