## Pelletizing
Pelletizing iron ore is undertaken due to the excellent physical and metallurgical properties of iron ore pellets. Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.They typically contain 64-72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets.

A process and arrangement are provided for the efficient generation of energy from coal, while at the same time providing for a relatively inexpensive step in processing of iron or steel, and the extraction of valuable materials such as oils from coal.An advantage to the process is that relatively low quality coals can be utilized, since the coal is pretreated before any burning operation.
