## The working principle of jaw crusher - Mining Mobile Crushers and 
Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.

## What is a Jaw Crusher - Quarrying & Aggregates
The working principle of jaw crushers: When working, the motor drives the belt and pulley to move the movable jaw up and down through the eccentric shaft. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate, and the material passes

## working principle of of jaw crusher
Jaw Crusher Working Principle A sectional view of the single-toggle type of jaw crusher is shown below In one respect, the working principle and application of this machine is similar to the Dodge crushers; the movable jaw has its maximum movement at the top of the crushing chamber, and minimum movement at the discharge point
