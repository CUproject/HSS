## Calorific Value - Definition, Calculating Method, Formula and  - VEDANTU
The calorific value defines the energetic content of the materials; it is the amount of heat a substance produces after complete combustion. You can express it as the gross calorific value (GCV) or high heating value. Also, the calorific value of a substance (generally, solid biofuel or food) is the specific energy of combustion for a unit mass.

Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.
