## Tapered Roller Bearing Uses and Advantages - Carnell Sales, Inc.
A tapered roller bearing is a unit that consists of both tapered raceways (inner and outer rings), and tapered rollers. The construction is intended for combination loads, such as dual acting axial and radial loads. The bearing axis is where the projected lines of the raceway combine at a common location to improve rolling, while reducing friction. The load capacity can be increased or

## Advantages and disadvantages of roller burnishing - MECHANICALFUNDA
Advantages of roller burnishing : Surface finish is good as a mirror Rz < 1 µm / Ra < 0.16 µm can be obtained. It is possible to achieve very close and consistent dimensional tolerance.Disadvantages of roller burnishing : There is obvious stratification between this layer and the inner material cause the surface to fall off.
