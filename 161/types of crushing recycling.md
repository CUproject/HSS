## Types of crushing machines - Simple English Wikipedia, the free 
Crushers are machines used to reduce the size of rocks, stones and ore. They are often utilized in aggregates production, construction material recycling and in mining operations. [1] There are four traditional types of crushers in materials engineering. They are known as jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, cone crushers and roll crushers.

Cone and gyratory crushers. Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are also compression-type machines that crush material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The output is controlled by the setting between the two pieces of steel. Though the chamber is round in shape, the moving piece of steel is not meant to rotate.

## Comparing The Different Types Of Stone Crushing Plants
Before investing in plants, one of the first things you'll want to compare are the total costs of the crushing plant ( costos totales de la planta de trituraciÃ³n ). You'll want to look at the price you'll be paying for the plant and what you'll be paying for. For example, an automatic plant will be more costly than a semi-automatic plant.

While most recyclers don't require you to crush cans, if you do recycle a lot, your normal bin may fill up quickly. The crusher gives you extra space by flattening either single or multiple cans.

Most crushers used for aggregate production can be categorised as one of three main types: Compression crushers - which squeeze the material until it breaks. Impact crushers - which use the principle of rapid impact to shatter material. A ttrition crushers - which use both impact and grinding to shear material.
