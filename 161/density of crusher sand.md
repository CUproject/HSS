The relative density (specific gravity) of an aggregate is the ratio of its mass to the mass of an equal volume of water. Relative Density = Mass of the Aggregate / Mass of equal volume of water. Key Features: Most aggregates have a relative density between 2.4-2.9 with a corresponding particle (mass) density of kg/m 3 ( lb/ft 3).
