## Co-firing Biomass with Coal - Penn State Extension
Source: Miller and Tillman (2008) and Bain et al. (2003). Biomass also tends to be less dense than coal. For example, pulverized coal, at 850 kg per m 3 (kilograms per cubic meter), is nearly seven times denser than baled straw (150 kg per m 3).This means that fuel feed systems will need to handle and deliver much higher volumes of fuel if co-firing is used.
