Please enter all dimensions in inches. Use this calculator to determine the maximum angle for your incline conveyor before a box will tumble. The maximum incline angle is 30 degrees without using a cleated belt. With a cleated belt you may be able to incline up to 45 degrees. This calculator assumes the weight is evenly distributed in the box.

## How to Calculate the weight of a conveyor belt?
Then use the weight calculation formula: Length (m) Width (m) Thickness (mm)12.5 ( coefficient) In this way, the approximate weight of a conveyor belt can be calculated. Below is the weight per meter of a conventional conveyor belt, you can directly multiply it by the length of the conveyor belt to get the weight of the conveyor belt.
