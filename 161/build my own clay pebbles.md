Give starting your seeds a try using clay pebbles. You can crush the medium to increase saturation or you can keep them whole, use small net pots, and cover the seed with a couple of pebbles. Misters set to bursts lasting four to 10 seconds every two or three hours will bring on germination. Just make sure you have soaked the pebbles beforehand.

Jan 24, 2022A: Hydroton is a hydroponic growing medium that can be applied to plants in order to provide them with the nutrients they need. The best way to apply it is by using a spray bottle and misting the plants leaves. Clay pebbles for plants are a great way to add some extra nutrients to your garden. They can be used as soil, or in pots and planters.
