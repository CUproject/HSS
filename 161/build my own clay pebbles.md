Give starting your seeds a try using clay pebbles. You can crush the medium to increase saturation or you can keep them whole, use small net pots, and cover the seed with a couple of pebbles. Misters set to bursts lasting four to 10 seconds every two or three hours will bring on germination. Just make sure you have soaked the pebbles beforehand.
