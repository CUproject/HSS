##  Fluidized Bed Dry Dense Medium Coal Beneficiation
3University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa Keywords: coal, beneficiation, ilmenite, magnetite Abstract— Coal beneficiation in South Africa is currently conducted mostly on a wet "float and sink" basis. This process is heavily water intensive and also potentially polluting. Dry beneficiation alternatives are being sought.

Background of Dry Coal Beneficiation in South Africa Most of the remaining coalfields in South Africa are found in arid areas where process water is scarce and, given the need to fully exploit all the coal reserves in the country, this presents a great challenge to the coal-processing industry.

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.

## Development of Air Dense Medium Fluidized Bed Technology For Dry 
Wet processing of coal requires a large quantity of water. Waste generated from wet process ties up a significant amount of water and land. The slurry ponds also pose serious problems in case of dam breakage. Dry beneficiation of coal offers a better alternative approach for cleaning coal.

## Dry beneficiation of coal: A review | Semantic Scholar
To intensify the production of coal, mechanisation of coal mining is gradually increasing. The process, being less selective, increases the quantity of shales, stones and other impurities in coal. Dry methods of separation of these impurities may serve as a preconcentration step prior to wet processes of beneficiation. Dry beneficiation will eliminate the energy intensive process of dewatering
