The standard grinding wheel is all about fast metal removal. Use the grinding wheel if you want to grind out welds, clean up cuts, and prep metal for welding (since you need bare shiny metal to weld). Of the four wheels, this removes material the fastest. It also produces hot, large sparks.

## Belt Sander for removing welds? - Practical Machinist
2323. For something like that I would use a 9" grinder with a rubber backed sanding disk- 80 grit. If there are any bad high spots on the weld take it down first with the 4 1/2 or 5" grinder. Hold the 9" as flat as possible to the metal. I have 4 or 5. 9" grinders and use them alot for this type of thing.

## 4 Tips to Avoid Over-Grinding with Your File Belt
Tip #4: Use larger, sweeping strokes to remove the spot weld. We often see users focusing their work on the spot weld itself by positioning the tool directly over the weld, pulling the trigger, and pushing down until they feel the weld is removed. This typically results in over-grinding the center of the spot weld and leaving the edges unremoved.
