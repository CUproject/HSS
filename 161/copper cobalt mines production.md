## Congo opens Chinese-owned Deziwa copper and cobalt mine
The Deziwa deposit, around 35 kilometres east of Kolwezi, is estimated to hold 4.6 million tonnes of copper and 420,000 tonnes of cobalt. Somidez, the joint venture controlling it, is held 51% by CNMC and 49% by Gécamines. An $880 million project which started construction in May 2018, the Deziwa mine aims to produce 80,000 tonnes of copper
