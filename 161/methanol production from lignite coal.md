Methanol can be produced from any resource which contains carbon that can be converted into synthesis gas. Feedstocks for methanol production include natural gas, coal, naphtha, biomass, various wastes as well as recycled CO 2 and hydrogen. Currently, about 65% of global production comes from natural gas, while the remainder is mainly from coal.

## Production of Methanol - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
As mentioned before, the common feed for methanol production is CO and H 2 produced from gasified coal and natural gas. This methanol production pathway is a fossil fuel base process and can dramatically result in the emissions of GHGs. On the other hand, synthesis gas is a valuable product and requires an extremely complex process for production.

## methanol production from lignite coal
(methanation), methanol and ammonia production. The multiple production of fuels, chemicals and electricity from coal gasification is defined as poly-generation. Coal gasification in IGCC plants holds the potential for easy capture of CO 2 from the syngas and for CO 2 storage in geological formations (CCS). Fig. 1 - Moving Bed Gasifier concept
