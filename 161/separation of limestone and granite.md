Limestone and Sandstone Composition. In general, limestone is defined as being composed of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate often comes from plant and animal skeletons and remnants including the shells of mollusks. Sandstone, on the other hand, is not described as coming from any one substance. It consists of sand sized debris, which

Limestone is common in Europe, which is why it has been used as a building material in the UK for thousands of years. Marble is less common, and the distinctive veining means that marble from different quarries can look very different, so there are limited supplies of some types of the stone.

There are two distinguishable lithologic types of marble: 1) Real marble which has been aged, and. 2) Calcium carbonate without the same degree of crystallization which can be polished. Limestone is sometimes incorrectly identified as marble because the stone in question supports a bright polish.

Limestone contains mineral components quartz, chert, clay, silt, calcite, and dolomite . Granite weighs approximately 2.65 to 2.76 grams per centimeter, cubed a little less dense than limestone. Its compressive strength, however, is higher than limestones as it is estimated to be 200MPa. The mineral components in granite are micas, biotite

Not all lakes are equally affected by acid rain; the damage depends on the kind of bedrock present. Limestone neutralizes acids and has a buffering effect, but granite, composed of silicates, does not undergo any acid-base reaction. So a lake surrounded by granite rock is likely to suffer more damage from acid rain.

The key difference between gypsum and limestone is that the calcium sulfate is the main constituent in gypsum whereas calcium carbonate is the main constituent of limestone.. Limestone and gypsum are minerals that form from calcium salts; limestone contains calcium carbonate while gypsum contains CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O. However, their properties and usages are different from each other.
