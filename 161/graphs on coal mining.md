## Mpumalanga crisis: why is nobody listening? - GroundUp News
Coal mining companies predictably argue that they are better job creators than agriculture and tourism, but even the biggest mines employ surprisingly few people full-time. Many of the new coal mining projects are short-term, with life-of-mine projections of between three and five years, and maximum employee numbers of less than 100 people.

The global coal trade doubled in the decade to 2012 as a coal-fueled boom took hold in Asia. Now, the coal trade seems to have stalled, or even gone into reverse. This change of fortune has devastated the coal mining industry, with Peabody - the world's largest private coal-mining company - the latest of 50 US firms to file for bankruptcy.

After stabilisation of prices in the beginning of 2020, Covid-related demand suppression pushed prices down. FOB prices for thermal coal with a calorific value (CV) of 6 000 kcal/kg which had

## The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the mining sector | McKinsey
Based on that assessment, we suggest that the mining industry risks losing an estimated $30 billion to $120 billion in EBITDA in 2020 versus 2019 because of the COVID-19 crisis, despite an expected revenue loss of $90 billion to $200 billion. We believe that the mining sector will remain relatively resilient and that part of the revenue loss
