Mar 10, 2021 The copper ore beneficiation process generally adopts a relatively simple process. After one stage grinding, the fineness -200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 to 3 selections, and 1 to 2 sweeping. If the copper mineral impregnation particle size is relatively fine, the stage grinding process can be considered.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total
