## How to Select the Correct Diamond Concrete Grinding Cup Wheel - Onfloor

## Use of Diamond Grinding Wheels Correctly
After fixing the diamond wheel on the flange, it should be statically balanced before using. It should be noted that do not remove the flange from the wheel until it has run out. The rigidity of the grinding machine is better, and the accuracy of spindle is higher ( radial runout is not more than 0.01mm), and it can be used for micro crossfeed.

Mar 26, 2021In general terms, the abrasive grit size range for grinding wheels runs between 12 grit for rough grinding operations, such as those found in steel mills, and 220 grit for very fine/precision grinding operations. Again, there is no industry standard, but in general terms: Coarse grits run 12 to 24. Medium grits run 30 to 70.

## Matters needing attention when using diamond grinding wheels
Apr 19, 2022The rotation direction of the diamond grinding wheel should be correct, so that the grinding debris can fly down and not hurt people. 3. After the grinding wheel is started, it should wait for the grinding wheel to rotate smoothly before starting grinding. If the grinding wheel jumps obviously, it should be stopped in time for repair.
