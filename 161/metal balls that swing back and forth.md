Ten pendulums swing back and forth at slightly different rates, determined by the length of the strings. Starting in sync, the pattern shifts over time, until finally the pendulums realign.  Twenty Phillips pan-head sheet-metal screws, #6 x 1/2 inch (13 mm)  At certain time intervals, however, the balls fall into recognizable patterns

## Swing Low: Investigate the Motion of a Pendulum | Science Project
A playground swing (Figure 1) is an example of a pendulum. The swing is supported by chains that are attached to fixed points at the top of the swing set. When the swing is raised and released, it will move freely back and forth. These back and forth movements are called oscillations. The swing is moving due to the force of gravity on the swing.

## Q: How do those "executive ball clicker" things work?
Showing that executive ball clickers work boils down to showing that v1 = 0. If the mass of every ball is, the velocity of the original moving ball before the collision is and the velocities of the two balls after the collision are, then: Using that result, and remembering that w 1 = v 1 +v 2, the only two possible solutions are "v 1 =w 1

## Pendulum - Class 7, Motion and Time, Science - Class Notes
A simple pendulum consists of a small metal ball (called bob) suspended by a long thread from a rigid support, such that the bob is free to swing back and forth. The motion of pendulum was first studied by Galileo. A pendulum completes every swing (or every oscillation) in exactly the same time, provided its length is kept constant.
