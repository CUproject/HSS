## The "Master Healer" - Quartz Crystal Healing Properties
The primary reason that quartz is held in such high regard is that it has the power to amplify the healing properties of other crystals. Essentially, when you practice crystal healing, quartz will intensify the power of all of your crystals. There is one caveat: it can also absorb negative emotions and intentions.
