This method of gold smelting uses a flux, a substance made of borax and sodium carbonate that removes impurities from gold. The first step is to buy a crucible container, used for holding the gold as it melts. This is a container created specifically for this process as it can withstand the heat used during the melting process.

16 sacks with 50-kg of ore were randomly taken from several days of gold-ore production. The random selection was used to compensate for the heterogeneity of gold content in the ore. The Kalinga miners processed a sack with their usual amalgamation technique. They recovered 1.2 grams of gold. A second sack was then processed using borax.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

## Gold Smelting at Home - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Melt metal all together. The copper melt first. Put the gold and lead Homogeneous. Pour the melted gold into the water.Broken down into smaller ones. To make it easier to use nitric acid to dissolve the metal is not gold. Pour the water out. The smelting of gold and poured into water pellet small.
