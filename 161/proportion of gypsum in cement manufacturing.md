Oct 28, 2021It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.

Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

## What is the difference between gypsum plaster and cement plaster?
Unlike cement plaster, gypsum plaster does not require punning or any special process to achieve smoothness on the surface. Thus, it saves costs and time.  Cement rendering involves a much higher proportion of sand for additional strength. The sand is also usually much more coarse, which helps increase the strength of the cement render.
