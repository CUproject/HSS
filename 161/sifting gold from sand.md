Apr 4, 2021The Sleeper Blue Dot Goby will keep the sand in your tank sifted without spreading it all over the rockwork. This goby fish reaches about 5.5 inches when mature, which makes it a perfect addition to a 30 to 50-gallon tank with a deep, mature sandbed. This six-spot goby is a member of the Valenciennea genus.

My personal favorite for bigger tanks 50+ is the diamond headed sleeper goby. Has an amazing personality and will eventually use little rocks to build up caves around where they sleep at night. Does an amazing job at cleaning the sand. If you have a large enough tank you can even do pairs which are fun to watch as well.

## Can You Extract Gold from Black Sand? - Reclaim, Recycle, and Sell your

## Why is sifting important?tankandlift
What is sieving or sifting? Sieving is a simple technique for separating particles of different sizes. A sieve such as used for sifting flour has very small holes.  Depending upon the types of particles to be separated, sieves with different types of holes are used. Sieves are also used to separate stones from sand.
