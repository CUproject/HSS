Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
