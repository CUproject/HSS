1.Size of fine aggregates: The largest size that falls under the limit of the exact set is 4.75 mm. Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.

## Use of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste in 
The use of recycled aggregates (RA) in construction constitutes a significant step towards a more sustainable society and also creates a new market opportunity to be exploited. In recent years, several case-studies have emerged in which RA were used in Geotechnical applications, such as filling materials and in unbound pavement layers.

Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up more than 90 percent of an asphalt pavement and up to 80 percent of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.

Mar 20, 2022Aggregates in house construction. Aggregates or crushed stone is one of the major raw materials used in the construction of a building. Also known as "metal" in the construction parlance, aggregate is a key ingredient of concrete, along with cement, sand, and water. In general, aggregate forms about 70-80% of the volume of the concrete.

## What Are Aggregates and How Are They Used? - CEMEX USA
Aggregates are granular materials that are used with a cementing medium to form concrete or hydraulic mortar. They are key ingredients in the manufacture of concrete, mortar, and other construction materials, and are used in the construction and maintenance of structures such as highways, walkways, parking lots, airport runways and railways.

There are three main sources of sand used in construction, river sand, crushed sand, and pit sand. River sand is usually obtained from river banks, while pit sand is obtained by digging deep pits. On the other hand, crushed sand is obtained by the strategic crushing of rocks (to fine particles) in quarries.

## Types of Aggregates Used in Road Construction (10 Different Types)
Shape: The shape of the various types of aggregates affects the work ability of the concrete and its strength. These are in four types as follows: 1. Rounded: It has 33-35% voids which is not suitable for concrete. 2. Irregular or partly rounded: It has 35-37% voids which is useful for medium quality concrete. 3.

## Uses for Construction Aggregates
The aggregates sizes are unique and serve a wide range of construction purposes. Crushed stone that is a fine dust or particle is often used as mix for concrete foundations and slabs. The sizes range from a dust to ¾ inches. It's also used in concrete patch repair products to repair holes or cracks. 1 to 2" crushed stone is used in
