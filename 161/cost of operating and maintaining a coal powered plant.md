As such, frequent cycling of coal-fired power plants can cause thermal and pressure stresses. Over time, these can result in premature component failure and increased, necessary maintenance. Starting a unit, increasing its output, or operating at part load can also increase emissions compared to non-cyclic operation. Assessment and control of

In 2008, about 55% of the U.S. coal fleet reported Form 1 data. EIA sorted these coal plants into three groups based on their average operating and maintenance costs. The highest cost group operated at costs ranging from $28 per megawatthour (MWh) to $40/MWh, and the lowest cost group operated at $20/MWh to $26/MWh.
