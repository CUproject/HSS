## Ball Mill Circulating Load - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The circulating loads generated in a typical ball mill cyclone circuit contain a small fraction of bypassed fines. The concept that high circulating loads will result in overgrinding can be refuted by regarding increases in circulating load in the same vein as multistage grinding. That is, for every incremental increase in circulating load of

Coal is an important fossil fuel resource for many nations due to its large remaining resources, relatively low production and processing cost and potential high energy intensity. Certain issues surround its utilisation, however, including emissions of pollutants and growing concern about climate change.

Oct 1, 2021Some beneficiation circulating water contains excess highly dispersed suspended particles, which are difficult to clarify only by simple concentration and sedimentation and cannot meet the requirements of reuse. To solve this problem, a clarification device was developed for removing the solid suspended matter from beneficiation circulating water, which consists of a hydraulic circulation area

## Calculated Circulating Load
Circulating load estimation in closed circuits. At each iteration the circulating load (CL) is calculated using the following equation: f i is the flow (volumetric or mass) which feeds the i-th unit operation unit that contributes directly to the circulating load; p i is the flow partition in the same unit operation, calculated according to the unit operation and its operational parameters.

Increasing the circulating load to 500% brings that value up to 2.6 times, for a further relative productivity increase of 30% (2.6/2.0 =1.30)." By keep on increasing the circulating load, typically you reach a point where the mill is overfilled and milling efficiency decreases. thus, there is an optimum circulating load.
