## Gold Extraction Process Methods Summary - JXSC Machine
The content of gold in the ore is extremely low. In order to extract gold, we need to crush the large ore rock into small pieces first, grind it, and then use appropriate gold processing methods to separate the gold from the ore, get the gold concentrate. The most used gold beneficiation method is gravity separation and flotation separation.

## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.

Feb 11, 2022The percolation cyanidation method is also one of the cyanide leaching processes. Its principle is that the cyanide solution penetrates through the ore layer to leach the gold from the gold-bearing ore. It is suitable for alluvial and loose porous materials. There are two kinds of percolation cyanidation methods: pool leaching and heap leaching.
