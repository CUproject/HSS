The motor drives the mobile jaw up and down through eccentric shaft. The angle between toggle plate and mobile jaw increases when mobile jaw plate moves up. So the mobile jaw plate closes up the fixed jaw plate. The stuff will be crushed in this process. The angle between toggle plate and moving jaw decreases when mobile jaw moves down.

## How to improve jaw crusher performance and productivity
Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.
