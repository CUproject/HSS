## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## Step by Step Guide to the Wet Grinding Process: Everything You Need to Know
Step 1: Wetting. The first step to wet grinding is eliminating air from the surface of the raw feed, so that each individual particle is fully in contact with the liquid slurry. Ensuring complete contact is vital for effective milling. This requires a liquid with lower surface tension than the free surface energy of the solid.

This meant that, for the first time, there was virtually no limit on the fineness that could be achieved. From the early 1900s, both for cement grinding and for grinding hard raw materials, whether by wet or dry process, the standard arrangement was a ball mill for preliminary grinding (to below 0.75 mm), followed by a tube mill for fine grinding.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement made of. - CivilSeek
In Wet Process, raw materials are supplied to the kiln in the form of an intimate mixture with a lot of water in it. This is called SLURRY. To obtain the SLURRY of a standard composition, the raw materials are first crushed separately using crushers for limestones and grinding mills (wet) for clays.

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln, which transforms it into clinker, which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement, and has a large effect upon the
