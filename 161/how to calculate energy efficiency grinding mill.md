## Pulp mill wastewater characteristics and treatment
The pulp and paper industry is one of the major consumer and polluters of freshwater. Approximately, 85% of the water consumed in the paper production is polluted, mainly in the pulp forming stage. For this reason, wastewater reuse in the process is one of the major issues that this industry needs to address.

Windmills, like waterwheels, were among the original prime movers that replaced animal muscle as a source of power. They were used for centuries in various parts of the world, converting the energy of the wind into mechanical energy for grinding grain, pumping water, and draining lowland areas. The first known wind device was described by Hero of Alexandria (c. 1st century ce).
