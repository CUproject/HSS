## Tests on Limestone - The Constructor
In this test, a sample of dry limestone is weighed and it is heated for four hours in an open fire. During heating, carbon dioxide present in the limestone evaporates and weight reduces. After heating, the sample is weighed for loss of weight is recorded. Form this data, Amount of calcium oxide content present is determined.
