Methods of assessing coal strength are compared on the basis of a literature review. The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) is the most expedient. There is a close relation between HGI and the coal quality, as well as the power consumed in grinding. Accordingly, the HGI values of coal samples may be used to optimize the crushing of coal as a preliminary to coke production.

Coal is slightly denser than water (1.0 megagram per cubic metre) and significantly less dense than most rock and mineral matter (e.g., shale has a density of about 2.7 megagrams per cubic metre and pyrite of 5.0 megagrams per cubic metre). Density differences make it possible to improve the quality of a coal by removing most of the rock matter

## Coal | Properties, Formation, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.

## Crushing properties of coal | Semantic Scholar
Methods of assessing coal strength are compared on the basis of a literature review. The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) is the most expedient. There is a close relation between HGI and the coal quality, as well as the power consumed in grinding. Accordingly, the HGI values of coal samples may be used to optimize the crushing of coal as a preliminary to coke production.

Feb 10, 2021When the amount of iron ore was 30%, the crushing strength of ferro-coke dropped to 18.15%. Among the four binders, coal tar pitch could significantly enhance the cold crushing strength of ferro-coke through decreasing the porosity of ferro-coke and improving the bonding effect between carbon matrix particles.
