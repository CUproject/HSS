## Free Additive Inverse Calculator that finds the Additive Inverse of 20 
The additive inverse of a number is what you add to a number to create the sum of zero. So in other words, the additive inverse of x is another number, y, as long as the sum of x + y equals zero. The additive inverse of x is equal and opposite in sign to it (so, y = -x or vice versa). Since (-20)+ (20)=0 then -20 is the Additive inverse of 20.
