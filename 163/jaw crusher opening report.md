For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Estimate Jaw Crusher Capacity - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The capacities are based on the crusher receiving full, continuous feed of clean, dry, friable stone weighing 100 lb/cu ft. These capacity tables show several significant differences between the two common types of primary crushers. A jaw crusher has a wider range of settings—generally, a maximum of two to three times the smallest setting.
