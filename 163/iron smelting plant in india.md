##  A brief history of the Indian iron and steel industry
The foundation of India's present iron and steel in-dustry was not laid until 1875, when a blast-furnace plant was built at Kulti, 145 miles west of Calcutta. The undertaking suffered many ups and downs until it passed into the hands of the Bengal Iron and â¢ Steel Company and later the Indian Iron and Steel Company.

##  CO 2 abatement in the iron and steel industry - USEA
cokemaking and iron ore preparation are described in Chapter 3. CO 2abatement from the different iron production routes, namely blast furnaces (BFs), direct reduction processes (which produce DRI) and the smelting reduction processes (which eliminate the need for coking and iron ore sinter plants) are covered in the following three chapters.
