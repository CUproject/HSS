## PROCESS AUTOMATION OF CEMENT PLANT
The cement manufacturing process consists broadly of mining, crushing and grinding, blending, pyroprocessing, clinker cooling, clinker storage, finish milling, packing and loading [2,3].The overall plant process flow is shown in the fig 1.This paper only reviews the flow of materials through the various stages to a particular place

## The Manufacturing Process of Cement in Factory | Mir Cement
Depending on the manufacturer's process, the grinding is done wet, dry, or semi-dry. In vertical shaft ball mills, 65% of the particles are smaller than 45 microns, and the balls used are around 12mm in size. The rotational speed can vary between 60 - 80 RPM. A typical ball mill can generate 3500 tons of cement per hour.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Raw Materials of Cement. Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone, Clay, Gypsum, Fuel, and Water (in wet method). 1. Limestones: These are sedimentary, calcium carbonate rocks (CaC0 3 ). Most commonly they contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate also.
