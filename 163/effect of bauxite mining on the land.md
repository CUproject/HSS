## How Does Mining Affect the Environment? | Greentumble
Different types of mining have various impacts on land. For example, strip mining results in the clearing of trees, plants and topsoil [2]. One effect of this type of mining on the environment is the pervasive problem of soil erosion, which in turn leads to the pollution of waterways.. Another destructive type of mining is underground coal mining.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## Bauxite and the Environment: Much Progress Mined
No one can question the enormously positive impact that the bauxite/alumina industry has had on the Jamaican economy over the last 53 years. The sector is today the second largest foreign exchange earner, raking in some US$901 million last year (an 18 per cent increase over 2003), and creating significant linkages in the economy as well as providing quality employment.

## Why Is Bauxite Important - Realonomics
Feb 17, 2022What makes bauxite special? It is a rock composed mainly of aluminum-bearing minerals. It forms when laterite soils are severely leached of silica and other soluble materials in a wet tropical or subtropical climate. Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum. Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been extracted from bauxite.
