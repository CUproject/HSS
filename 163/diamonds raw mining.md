## Lab Grown Diamonds India | CataIndia
May 24, 2021Diamonds grown in a laboratory have the same chemical composition as mined diamonds. However, they have better cut, color, and clarity properties that are superior to many mined diamonds. Cultured diamonds also cost less than mined diamonds. This is because the cost of mining raw materials is not part of their production process.

The mill was also known to reject diamonds smaller than 40 carats. After the mine had terminated operations, the first sample of tailings tested yielded several diamonds including one >6 carats! About 50% of the diamonds recovered from the Wyoming kimberlites were high-quality gemstones. About 30% from the Kelsey Lake were gem-quality.

Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers. Once the water is emptied out and prevented from flowing into the area of interest, bulldozers are then used to exploit the ground of the riverbank. Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters. When the diamond-rich depth is reached, the raw
