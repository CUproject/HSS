Thus, the first Blanchard Surface Grinder was born in 1909. Once word spread about this new machine tool, inquiries came pouring in. Winslow Blanchard obliged and began building vertical rotary surface grinders. The first machine was a 16″ diameter grinding wheel with a 26″ diameter work table. It was a relatively simple, but effective machine.

The production of artificial abrasives in the late 19th century opened up a new field of machine tools, that of grinding machines. C.H. Norton of Massachusetts dramatically illustrated the potential of the grinding machine by making one that could grind an automobile crankshaft in 15 minutes, a process that previously had required five hours.

Feb 22, 2022Do not use a grinding wheel that has any abnormality. If the grinding wheel's hole diameter does not match the machine, avoid forcing the wheel into the machine. Do not go beyond the maximum operating speed as indicated on the grinding wheel. Do not over-tighten the nuts when mounting onto the flanges.
