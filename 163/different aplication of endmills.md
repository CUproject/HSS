## Benefits & Drawbacks of High and Low Helix Angles
Benefits. Lower Radial Force - The tool will run quieter and smoother due to better shearing action, and allow for less deflection and more stability in thin wall applications. Efficient Chip Evacuation - As the helix angle increases, the length of cutting edge engagement will decrease, and the axial force will increase.

What are tapered end mills used for? Tapered end mills are used on CNC or manual milling machines for die- and mold-machining applications and for milling channels with a taper angle. Tapered end mills create slots or grooves with tapered walls in a workpiece. They have a conical cutting head that is wider at the base than the tip.

Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

An end mill is a type of milling cutter, a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications. It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application, geometry, and manufacture. While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction, most milling bits can cut in the radial direction. Not all mills can cut axially; those designed to cut axially are known as end mills.
