Hot Rolling Principle of Rolling Mill. Hot rolling is based on slabs (mainly continuous casting billets), which are heated to form strips by roughing rolling mills and finishing rolling mills. The hot steel strip from the last rolling mill of the finishing mill is cooled to a set temperature by laminar flow, rolled into a steel coil by a coiler

## Cold Working: Definition, Methods, Working Process, Advantages 
This cold rolling process is carried below the recrystallization temperature of the metal or, in most cases at room temperature, it is called cold rolling. Usually, cold rolling is used after the hot rolling of metal to give the metal a clean and smooth finishing. It also increases tensile strength and stiffness.
