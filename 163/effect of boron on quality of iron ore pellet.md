## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %). Normally pellets are reduced considerably faster than sinter

Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron

##  The Effect of Particle Size on Green Pellet Properties of Iron Ore 
ores. This study deals with the beneficiation and agglomeration of the low grade iron ore; up to the extent such that it becomes an ideal blast furnace feed. Effect of particle size on pellet quality during pellet making has also been aimed and studied along with the development of flowsheet for beneficiation of low grade iron ore.

## Characterization of Colemanite and Its Effect on Cold Compressive 
Oct 16, 2020In this study, the effect of colemanite and calcined colemanite (CC) addition on the properties of iron ore pellets is studied. The pellets are prepared in a lab without and with 0.2% colemanite and varying amounts of CC from 0 to 1.0 wt% in steps of 0.2%. A reference pellet is prepared under typical plant conditions, and the properties of the reference pellet are considered as the base value
