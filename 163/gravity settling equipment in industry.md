Gravity Settling Equipment In Industry. The ALAR Clar-O-Floc Clarifier Plate Clarifier is a gravity settling and decant system. The Clarifier produces a clear effluent through the separation of liquid from settling solids. Concentrated heavy solids sink to the bottom of the clarifier and are pumped to a sludge settling tank and dewatering filter.

## THICKENERS
A thickener is an equipment structure used for the continuous gravity settling (sedimentation) of solids in suspensions. Suspension is fed into one or more basins or chambers and, whilst it is passing through, the solids settle out. The thickened solids are removed together with a portion of the liquid as thickened "underflow".

## Emulsion treating methods - PetroWiki
Gravity settling is the oldest, simplest, and most widely used method for treating crude-oil emulsions. The density difference between the oil and the water causes the water to settle through and out of the oil by gravity. The gravitational force is resisted by a drag force from their downward movement through the oil.

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

## Secondary clarifier in wastewater treatment
MATERIALS AND METHODS There are two secondary clarifiers at the Al-Dewanyia Wastewater Treatment Plant. These are circular with a 30 m diameter by 3.0 m deep wall and are centrally fed. Each unit is nominally designed to handle 250 m3/hr flow, with an equal flow rate of sludge recycled to the activated sludge plant.
