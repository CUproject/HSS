Hard rock mining is expensive. Unlike placer gold that can be found with just a simple shovel and gold pan, extracting gold from ore takes considerable start-up costs.

## Gold Mining Methods
Summary. Historically, the majority of gold was mined from "placer deposits", where gold has settled out of an existing or ancient waterway downstream of where nuggets had eroded out of rock outcrops.Some early miners also used an early form of hardrock mining, digging solid veins of gold out of rock, where mineralized water had deposited it over thousands of years.

Hard rock gold mining can be open-pit or underground. Examples of large open-pit operations are the Fort Knox Mine in Alaska and the Goldstrike Mine in Nevada. For underground mining, tunnels and/or shafts are excavated. Some of the largest operations are found in South Africa, where some mines go down several thousand meters below the surface.
