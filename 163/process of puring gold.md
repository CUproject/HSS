## Process Of Refining Gold | My Gold Guide
This process is known to purify gold to 99.95%. This method got its name from Francis Bowyer Miller, its inventor. In the Miller process, unrefined gold is first melted. Then, chlorine gas is passed through it. The gas turns other metals and impurities into a solid form, making it easy to separate them from gold.

## process of puring gold
The more gold, the faster the process. This is because it is the friction of gold against gold which facilitates the cleaning process. Once the gold is glittery, rinse the soapy water out of the jar, pour the gold into a small (metal) finishing pan, and heat it up (outside and down wind) until the gold takes on a deep, natural, shiny luster.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

## God's pruning process for Christians: How is God pruning you?
What Jesus says in John 15:1-4 is a great reminder of the positivity and purpose of pruning. "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.

You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
