## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

This is probably dolomite countertops' greatest strength over quartz.

But quartz can't take heat or sunlight, a hot pan will mark it for life. Dolomite can, and it will hold heat really well.

If you place dolomite in the centre of a room or space it will balance and ground the rooms energy. Minerals that can be found with dolomite are calcite, fluorite, barite, quartz and occasionally with gold. While dolomite can be found throughout the world the majority of it is used commercially for industrial and pharmaceutical products.

Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.

Specimens are usually found in crystal clusters and have been known to be large in size. Transparent dolomite gems can be difficult to find due to their cleavage and low hardness value.

## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.
