The Ruth Mullin's Coal fire, aka Kentucky's own underground Hell, has been burning for over 5 decades. It was named after the women who found it, as it customary in the area. Some also refer to it as the Lost Mountain fire. This old mine in Perry, close to the Hazard line is among several coal fires that have become part of Eastern Kentucky

## Underground Coal Mine Transportation System - SKE Industries
In the modern coal mining plant, we often use steel cord rubber belt conveyor to move coal in underground. Underground coal mining is one of the oldest forms of mining. This type of underground mining took a lot of planning, where tunnels were built to and from ventilation shafts and rail shafts to allow for transporting coal with belt conveyor.
