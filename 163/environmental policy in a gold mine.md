While a number of studies have looked at the impacts of gold mining on the environment (Hens and Boon, 1999, Hilson, 2002a, Hilson, 2002b, Campbell, 2009), there have been limited efforts directed at understanding the challenges and opportunities facing the implementation of the existing environmental regulatory policies within Ghana's gold
