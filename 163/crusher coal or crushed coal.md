## how coal is crushed into powder
Coal is the largest source of energy for electricity around the world. to turn coal into electricity the rock is crushed into powder which is then burned in a furnace that has a boiler. Heat from the coals causes water to boil and create steam. Steam from boiling water powers turbines. Turbine movement creates electricity.
