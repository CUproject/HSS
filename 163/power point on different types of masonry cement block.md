By code, it usually needs about 20 mm to 75 mm of coverage on all sides depends upon structure type. So, the cover block lifts the rebar up by about 20 mm to 75 mm and becomes a permanent and integral part of the poured concrete, ensuring that no part of the rebar sags and minimizes the required concrete coverage during the pouring of concrete.
