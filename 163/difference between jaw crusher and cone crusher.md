## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
The coarse jaw crusher has a large amount of dust emission, while the cone crusher is much better. Compared with the cone crusher, the sealing of the jaw crusher is relatively poor. The cone crusher spreads less dust with a deep crushing cavity. What's more, the materials of jaw crushers are usually larger or sticky, which increases its dust

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.
