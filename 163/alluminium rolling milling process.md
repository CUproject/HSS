Rolling Process Definition. The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.

The coefficient of friction is constant in theory, but in reality it varies along the arc of contact. The metal is considered to deform plastically during rolling. The volume of metal is constant before and after rolling.
