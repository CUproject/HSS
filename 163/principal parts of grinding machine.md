## Working principle of a grinding machine - studentlesson
The working of a grinding machine: A grinder features an electric motor that supplies motion power to the grinding wheel using pulley and belt. For the portable grinder, the rotor is inside the grinding machine and the power switch is located beside the handle of a grinder. So, the switch must be pressed before the grinder works.

## Cylindrical Grinding Machine: Working, Parts, Types, Uses - Mechical
Oct 21, 2021Hello friends. In this article, I am going to explain the key aspects of a cylindrical grinding machine (e.g. parts, types, uses, etc). The cylindrical grinding machine is basically a type of grinding machine like a surface grinding machine, tool and cutter grinding machine, centerless grinding machine, etc.. So let's get started.

## Electrochemical Grinding: Definition, Parts or Construction, Working 
The working principle of electrochemical grinding is When a metal surface is acted upon with an electrolyte under a high current, the metal surface gets oxidized to form an oxide layer (corrosive layer). This layer is removed with the action of a flowing electrolyte and rotating grinding wheel.  Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working
