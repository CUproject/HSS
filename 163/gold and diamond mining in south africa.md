Diamond and gold production are now well down from their peaks, though South Africa is still number 5 in gold [3] but remains a cornucopia of mineral riches. It is the world's largest producer [4] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite. It is the second largest producer [4] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium.
