## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

The above pre-treatment stages can be changed based on ore mineralogy. For a complex Au-Ag ore, direct cyanide leaching resulted in only about 47% and 19% extraction of gold and silver even after very fine grinding at <38 Âµm.Diagnostic leaching was carried out to assess the nature of refractoriness [29].Depending on the results of the diagnostic test results, extraction strategies for gold

The standard cyanide leach process consists of grinding the ore to about. 80% - 200 mesh, mixing the ore/water grinding slurry with about 2 pounds. per ton of sodium cyanide and enough quick lime to keep the pH of the solution. at about 11.0. At a slurry concentration of 50% solids, the slurry passes.
