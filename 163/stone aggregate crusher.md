## Crusher Run - What is it? - Gravelshop
Crusher Run gravel -- also known as 'Crush and Run', 'Crush N Run', 'Graded Aggregate Base' (GAB), or 'Aggregate Base Coarse' (ABC Stone) -- has perhaps even more useful applications than it does names it goes by. The material is most commonly used in home projects as a compactible sub-base material. It is a combination of coarse and fine

## Aggregate and Mining - Crusher Backing - Copps Industries
Crushing machines—also referred to as crushers—are designed to break large, dense materials (e.g., stone and ore) into more manageable forms. They are commonly used in quarries to reduce larger materials into smaller, size-specific pieces and aggregate plants to produce smaller rocks and powders for use in asphalt, concrete, and gravel.
