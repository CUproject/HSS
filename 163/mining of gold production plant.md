After the gold ore has been removed from the earth using mining equipment, it is sent to a gold processing plant. The typical gold processing plant begins with a cone crusher, to reduce the particle size of the ore. Next, it is loaded on a conveyor belt, where an overbelt magnet removes tramp metal from the gold mining process.

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation - Waihi Gold
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## Gold Mining Process
Nov 1, 2021Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles. The stockpiles containing the ore will be processed to extract the gold. Trucks move waste to a waste rock stack, which can be rehabilitated to fill previously mined areas.

## Gold processing 101 - Mining Magazine
At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost

## The Mining Process - OceanaGold
The Mining Process. Gold at Macraes is known as 'refractory ore', which means it is ultra-fine and resistant to the typical cyanide leach process. The mining process at Macraes is circular and follows a cycle of exploration, mining, processing and rehabilitation and closure. With a 30-year history of development spanning fluctuating gold
