Antifreeze additives in concrete - allow to conduct construction procedures using concrete mixtures even at minus temperatures, withstand frosts to -15 degrees, and some up to -25 degrees. Additives for accelerated durability - are necessary to increase this figure for the first time day, and the strength of ready-mixed concrete also increases.

## Durability Of Concrete Additives
Durability is an important concept to consider when it comes to specifying requirements for precast concrete products. products used above or below ground may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions. without durability, the concrete product may deteriorate atate much faster than the anticipated life span of 50 to 100 years.

## Quality and Durability of Concrete - NBM&CW
In such situation, although rural concrete roads are supposed to be of M 30 grade, and the RCC slabs in houses are supposed to be of M 20 grade, the real scinario is terrible. With hand mixing of concrete, and with rodding of concrete in the formwork, no durable concrete can be produced. The result is shorter life - span of concrete structures.
