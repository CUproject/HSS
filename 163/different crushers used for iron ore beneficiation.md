## Developments in iron ore comminution and classification technologies 
Hematite and magnetite are the most prominent iron ores. Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores (direct shipping ore (DSO)) are subjected to simple dry processes of beneficiation to meet size requirements. This involves multistage crushing and screening to obtain lump (− 31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately − 6.3 mm) products.

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Screening is an important step for dry beneficiation of iron ore. Crushing and screening is typically the first step of iron ore beneficiation processes. In most ores, including iron ore, valuable minerals are usually intergrown with gangue minerals, so the minerals need to be separated in order to be liberated.
