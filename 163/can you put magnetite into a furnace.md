Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.

These are furnace cold air return requirements. You can check the airflow on the specification sheet of your furnace. If you've misplaced that, or can't find the furnace airflow on the furnace itself, you can use this simple rule: "200 CFM for 10,000 BTU of heating output" That means that a 60,000 BTU furnace produces 1,200 CFM airflow.
