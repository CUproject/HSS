## reduction ratio of mm jaw crusher
Jaw crushers normally take the mined material and reduce it to a manageable size -say 10 to 4 inches. Cone crushers take the material from a jaw crusher and further reduce the material size. Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio
