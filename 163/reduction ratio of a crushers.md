## reduction ratio of mm jaw crusher
Jaw crushers normally take the mined material and reduce it to a manageable size -say 10 to 4 inches. Cone crushers take the material from a jaw crusher and further reduce the material size. Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio

R: Size reduction ratio. The ratio of the gape width to the near side jaw opening. This ratio may vary from 1/3 to 1/9, but is generally 1/3 for primary crushers and 1/4 for secondary crushers. θ: Nip angle. One of the most important parameters is the angle between the two jaws, which is referred to as the nip angle.

Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.
