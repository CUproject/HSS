## Why are mining dump trucks so big?
As companies mine the ground for coal and other valuable resources, huge dump trucks are needed to carry the extremely-large loads of dirt, coal, and rocks that are taken out of the ground. And the more a dump truck can carry, the less it costs the mining company per load to haul its resources.

## Coal India Effort to Further Reduce Emission - Economy India
Nov 2, 2021CIL has over 2500 dumpers operating in opencast coal mines and the fleet consumes about 65 to 75 percent of the total diesel used by CIL. LNG is likely to replace diesel use by 30 to 40 percent and reduce fuel cost by about 15 percent paving the way for Rs.500 crore savings annually if all heavy earth moving machines including dumpers are retrofitted with LNG kits.
