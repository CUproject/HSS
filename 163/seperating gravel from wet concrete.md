149 Posts. #14 · Apr 23, 2007. Here is are some different ideas that we've done. 1 . Go to a equipment rental business. Around here they have mixers on site and can shoot a yd. of crete into a trailer buggy . 2. If you have a 1 ton truck, just have them shoot it into the back of that.

## What Happens When Concrete Is Too Wet? - Concrete Questions
Water plays an essential role in concrete because the more water added into a mixture, the less strength a hardened mixture will have. When concrete gets too wet, the excess water will evaporate and escape the hardened concrete, causing the concrete to shrink and crack. When preparing your mixture, measure the water to your cement ratio.
