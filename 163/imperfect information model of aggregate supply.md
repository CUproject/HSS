The Imperfect-Information Model The second explanation for the upward slope of the short-run aggregate supply. curve is called the imperfect-information model. Unlike the sticky-wage model, this model assumes that markets clear—that is, all wages and prices are free to adjust to balance supply and demand.

##  The Lucas Imperfect - Information Model - Bambang Juanda
The explanation for the upward slope of the short-run aggregate supply curve is called the imperfect-information model. Unlike the sticky-wage model, this model assumes that markets clear-- that is, all wages and prices are free to adjust to balance supply and demand. In this model, the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves differ because

This chapter and Romer's Section 6.9 examine Robert Lucas's imperfect infor-mation model, which sits at a major crossroads in the evolution of macroeconomic theory. The Lucas model represents macroeconomists' first voyage into mathemati-cal modeling of a complete monetary-macroeconomic system based on well-specified microeconomic assumptions.

A more sophisticated analysis of the aggregate supply equation concludes that the SRAS curve is upward sloping. The four different models used to explain an upward sloping SRAS curve are: (1) the sticky-wage model, (2) the worker-misperception model, (3) the imperfect-information model, and (4) the sticky-price model.
