## Granite Quarrying - A Collection at the Cape Ann Museum: An American 
Granite quarrying started slowly in this area in the late 18th century with small operations peppered across the rocky terrain. Construction of a fort at Castle Island in Boston Harbor in 1798 followed by a jail in nearby Salem in 1813, jump started the granite business here on Cape Ann. During the 1830s and 1840s, the trade grew steadily.
