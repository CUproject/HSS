Lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, and batteries. It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4 O 10 (F,OH) 2, spodumene LiAl (SiO 3) 2 and also subsurface brines. Australia and Chile are the world's largest producers of lithium.

Abstract. Although tantalum and lithium are chemically quite different elements, they both occur in the Greenbushes pegmatite in adjacent mineralogical zones. Tantalum occurs as complex pentoxide minerals in association with niobium and tin. It is recovered by gravity separation followed by pyrometallurgical processes, and then solvent
