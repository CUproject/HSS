Polymer concrete is a composite material in which the aggregate is bound together in a matrix with a polymer binder. The composites do not contain a hydrated cement phase, although portland cement can be used as an aggregate or filler. Polymer concrete composites possess a unique combination of properties dependent on the formulation. These include rapid curing at ambient temperatures from

## Polymer concrete
Polymer concrete, also known as Epoxy Granite, is a type of concrete that uses a polymer to replace lime-type cements as a binder.In some cases the polymer is used in addition to Portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971.

Polymer concrete is generally produced by reducing the volume of voids in aggregates, which lowers the quantity of polymer required for binding the aggregates in question. The polymeric resins that are commonly used to produce this type of concrete are methacrylate, epoxy resin, furan resins, polyester resin, and vinylester resin.
