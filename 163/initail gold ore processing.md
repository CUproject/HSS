Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

Ore processing in IC² is a multi-stage process, requiring several machines in order to get the maximum possible yield from each individual ore. The best ore yield comes from a three-stage process. The first stage is a necessity; the second or third may optionally be skipped, but will reduce yield. Stage 1: Macerator Stage 2: Ore Washing Plant Stage 3: Thermal Centrifuge A Macerator processes

A process for extracting gold from a gold-bearing ore. The process includes, first, providing a leaching liquor with thiosulfate anion and ethylenediamine. Next, the leaching liquor is contacted with the gold-bearing ore to form a pregnant leach solution including gold dissolved from the gold-bearing ore. Finally, at least part of the gold in the pregnant leach solution is recovered.

## Processing of refractory gold ores - ScienceDirect
The ongoing depletion of gold and silver-containing ore deposits demands a shift towards the processing of more complex sources. Leaching of gold or silver from these sources, which are named refractory and are typically low-grade, can be complicated due to one or more of the following effects: (1) kinetic or thermodynamic impediments on cyanide diffusion or on the dissolution of minerals, (2

## Gold Recovery Process from Primary and Secondary Resources Using 
5. Recovery of gold from Mongolian gold ore. At present, majority of gold has been recovered from gold and silver ores by means of cyanide process developed at the beginning of twentieth century as schematically shown in Figure 14. In this process, pulverized ores are leached using alkaline cyanide solution to extract gold as gold(I)-cyanide
