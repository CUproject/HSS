A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

When a rock has values in it, it's then called ore. In order to liberate the minerals, it needs to be crushed down. In days of yore, a stamp mill was the primary form of crushing rock, but in the modern world, there are jaw crushers, impact mills and gyrator crushers, as well as ball mills. They all have their own pros and cons -- and price tags.

## Stamp Mill Guide | Learn About This Device
A stamp mill is a mechanical device used to separate gold from rocks and ore. It features a number of sizable steel stamps. These stamps are attached to powerful battering arms, which raise and lower the stamps. When the stamps are lowered they come crashing down with a powerful force, crushing the material beneath them.
