## Concrete Vs. Stone: Which Is More Cost Effective?
Concrete is formed from a mixture of aggregate, cement, pigments and dye. These materials cost less to produce than stone, hence why concrete pavers are a more economical option. Concrete is usually cheaper to purchase and install compared with stone, but it may tally up additional costs over time. Concrete is far more prone to cracking than

Stone dust is a by-product of crushed stone and typically used in between pavers or bricks in patios and walkways. When used alone, it forms a hard material for water to run off. We also suggest this product as a base for horse stalls.  Concrete Sand is a coarse sand that is washed and screened to a larger grit than mason sand. Concrete sand

However, without proper moisture and upkeep the stone dust layer can compact too well, like concrete, and become harmful to the horse's hooves. Because of this, some horse owners and landscapers recommend mixing ground/recycled rubber or sand into the stone dust surface layer to prevent over-compaction.

Nov 6, 2020Stone dust (SD) is one such alternative material which can be successfully used in construction and used as partial replacement of natural sand.

In this study, sand is replaced by stone dust in different percentages ranging from 0 to 60%.

## Flagstone Mortar Mix - Ask the Builder
Keep in mind that the Portland cement is the glue that holds the flagstone and brick to the concrete patio. Years ago many recipes I looked at suggested a ratio of three parts sand to one part cement for cement mortars. I altered that recipe and always mixed my ingredients 3 parts sand to 1.5 parts cement.

Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.
