Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

Copper ore is an ore that can be obtained from copper deposits or copper rocks. Copper ore can be obtained by mining a copper deposit, which spawns in copper resource islands around the player's island. Mining the copper deposit will drop 30 - 50 copper ore. Copper rocks naturally generate on Buffalkor Island and in the Diamond Mines. Mining a copper rock yields 1 - 2 copper ore after each

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

Once you free your pattern from the copper sheet, smooth down the edges.

##  How Copper Ore is Transformed into Products You Use Everyday
How Copper Ore is Transformed into Products You Use Everyday by David F. Briggs There are generally two types of copper ores, sulfide ores and oxide ores. Sulfide ores contain  (99.99% copper) is stripped from the starter sheets and shipped to a rod plant, where it is melted and cast into copper rod or copper cakes that are sold to

## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

## Copper Patina | How to Patina Copper | Patina Color - Worldcoppersmith
The first reaction that gives patina its color is when one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of water, both in the air, react with two molecules of copper oxide on the surface of the copper. The result is a compound called malachite (Equation 4), which varies in color from shades of dark green to shades of blue.
