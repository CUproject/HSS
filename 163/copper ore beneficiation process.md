copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Jul 20, 2022In the flotation process of copper ore, the beneficiation reagent is an important factor that determines the flotation effect. It is one of the main research directions of mineral processing workers to explore a new copper flotation process and develop new cost-effective and environmentally friendly reagents to improve the utilization rate of

## Copper Ore Beneficiation-MECRU
Flotation Flotation is an important part of copper ore beneficiation process. It mainly uses flotation machine. The flotation machine uses the method of chemical flotation. Through continuous stirring, the foam is refined at the same time, so that the minerals are bound to the foam and float to the slurry surface to form.
