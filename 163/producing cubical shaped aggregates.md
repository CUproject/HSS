## Types of Construction Aggregates - Veedu Building Materials
Mar 1, 2022The spherical and cubical-shaped aggregates are the most preferred category. Rough surface aggregates work better than smooth surface aggregates. For this very reason, coarse aggregates are used more in construction than fine aggregates.  Without a doubt, it makes them suitable for producing high-quality concrete. Flaky Aggregates. An

Crushing for particle shape Aggregates Manager . Typically, when crushing aggregates for particle shape, the desired output is a cubical product. In concrete production, a cubical aggregate product requires less water and cement than a flat and elongated product. Similarly, with asphalt production, cubical aggregate requires less asphalt binder

Impact crushers in either primary or secondary position—in particular, HSIs—are ideal for producing a high percentage of cubical aggregates. If you use an impactor as primary, you start the process of having a cubical shape right there, and the cubical proportion is increased as material moves to the secondary or tertiary crushing stages.
