Oct 6, 2020Gold mining companies had an increase of 35% in revenue. Revenue for the 'other mining' segments increased by 7%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident from April 2020, with reductions in revenue being seen across the industry. South African PGMs and gold are mainly mined in deep-level underground mines and were therefore hardest hit.
