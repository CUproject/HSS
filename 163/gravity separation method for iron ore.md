Nov 28, 2021On passing the ore via an upward stream of water, the lighter gangue particles are separated from the heavier metal ore. This is a gravity separation method.  By eliminating non-magnetic impurities, this process is utilised to concentrate magnetic ores of iron such as magnetite and chromite and manganese (pyrolusite). A magnetic separator is

Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al., 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al., 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

The gravity separation method is based on the gravity differences between the ore and the gangue particles in the ore. Metal ores are, on average, heavier than gangue particles. This feature is used in the gravity separation process to concentrate ore.  Iron oxide ore hematite is a common resource. Fe2O3 is the chemical formula for hematite.
