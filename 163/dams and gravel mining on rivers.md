## Impacts of riverine sand mining on freshwater ecosystems: A review of 
Rivers are a major source of sand and gravel for numerous reasons: cities tend to be located near rivers so transport costs are low; river energy grinds rocks into gravels and sands, thus eliminating the cost of mining, grinding, and sorting rocks; and the material produced by rivers tends to consist of resilient minerals of angular shape that
