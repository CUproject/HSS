The processing system of the double-toothed roller crusher makes it possible to crush any type of raw material from hard (limestone and rock) to soft (clay, soil and mud) or even elastic-like wood or rubber tyres. The rotation speed, especially if compared to traditional crushers, is very low; so low, in fact, that tip speed is under 3 m/s.
