## Six Factors That Influence Gold Leaching in Gold Cyanidation Leaching 
3. Factor Affecting Gold Leaching: Cyanide Agent Dosage. Gold is a kind of inactive metal, which can cause complexation reaction with cyanogen (CN-) under the action of oxygen in the cyanide leaching process, and then results in Au (CN) 2-. Therefore, cyanide agent dosage is one of the key factors determining the gold dissolution.

Cyanide process which is also known as the Macarthur-forest process is widely used in extracting gold or silver from the ores by dissolving them in a dilute solution of potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide. This process was introduced in the year 1887 by Scottish chemists named Robert W. Forrest, John S. MacArthur, and William Forrest.

1.Gold Cyanidation Principle. Gold Cyanidation is a method in which gold is extracted from gold-bearing ores using aqueous solution of cyanide as solvent, and then gold is extracted from gold-bearing leaching solution. It includes cyanide leaching process and deposition gold extraction process. First, gold in the gold-bearing ore reacts with cyanide to form a complex into the solution, and

The formation of copper and silver cyanide complexes a ects the gold recovery in both the cyanide leaching process as well as the puriﬁcation and reﬁning stages [7]. These e ects mainly interfere with the gold cyanide reaction and the carbon adsorption. Most of the copper minerals react rapidly with cyanide, forming multiple cyanide complexes.

Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.

## Gold_cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest Process) is a metallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to water soluble aurocyanide metallic complex ions. It is the most commonly used process for gold extraction.Due to the highly poisonous nature of cyanide, the process is highly controversial.

## Detailed Cyanidation Process Gold
A review of thiocyanate gold leaching Chemistry. 1. Introduction. Cyanidation has been widely used as a simple, selective, and economical method for gold extraction from ores for over a century (Gönen, 2003).Because of environmental concerns and safety issues associated with the use of cyanide, researchers have been looking for less toxic or non-toxic alternatives for gold leaching

## What Is the Difference between Gold Flotation and Cyanidation?
4.Agents. Flotation and cyanidation are both chemical processing methods, therefore, the process of mineral processing is naturally indispensable agents. Gold flotation needs foaming agent, inhibitor, activator, collector and so on. But for the cyanidation process, agent is relatively simple and the ore is just leached with cyanidation agent.
