Jul 20, 2022Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

Dec 4, 2020Gold processing is about preparing the gold ore for using it in different products. The vital gold ores come with gold in the Indigenous form. It is available in both endogenetic as well as exogenetic forms. Gold in the endogenetic form comes from the underground. On the other hand, the exogenetic form is available at the earth's surface.
