## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

Pelletizing is the process of converting very fine iron ores into spheres (normally 8mm-20mm in diameter), known as pellets. These pellets are suitable for both blast furnaces and direct iron reduction processes.. Pelletizing normally has four processes: (i) receipt of raw materials, (ii) pretreatment, (iii) balling and (iv) induration and cooling. Receipt of Raw Materials:

## Investigation on mercury flow and emission in integrated primary iron 
1 day agoThe raw materials like iron ore, coal contains small amount of mercury, which released during steel production.  fine, binders and additives are converted to pellets of certain size for use in blast furnace. In both the sinter and pellet plant iron ore, coal, etc. are heated at high temperature and the flue gas released in the atmosphere
