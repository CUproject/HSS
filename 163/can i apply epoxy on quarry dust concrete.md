## How to Control Dust in Quarries | Quarrying & Aggregates
In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle ≥45°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

## Can Epoxy Be Installed Over Existing Tile Floors?
Jun 3, 2021The Bottom Line. There are many things to consider when applying epoxy over existing tile. The bottom line, however, is that you cannot put epoxy over bad tile. And even if the tile is in good enough condition that a full removal is not warranted, careful and comprehensive mechanical surface preparation is always needed.

## Epoxy Finish on concrete - my experience - FineWoodworking
It took quite a lot of effort to work the epoxy into the brushed concrete. As a result, the coverage was about 20% less than advertised.
