The process uses coal gas for pre-heating & for partial reduction. Hematite / limonite / goethite ores get converted into magnetite ore in 1-10 minutes depending on the size of iron ore, at temperatures of degree C. The left-over heat, after reduction, is utilized for 3 stage pre-heating of iron ore.

The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Iron ore beneficiation technologies - GoodRich MAGMA
We offer dry beneficiation plants to up-grade the contaminated hematite iron ores. In the dry beneficiation process, iron ore is ground to 0-2 mm size. After screening, the fines are passed through a very high gauss rare earth magnetic separator (up to 8,000 gauss). A demo plant has been set up & experiments on many types of raw materials were

The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3). Quartz dissipates easily, breaking down to fines with little applied stress. Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

The present study aims to recover iron values from discarded slime containing assay ~56% Fe, ~6.5% SiO2, and ~7.0% Al2O3 from Noamundi processing plant by using high gradient magnetic separator (HGMS).

## Detailed analysis of iron ore beneficiation process
At present, powdered ores are usually selected by strong magnetic separation, gravity separation, flotation or combined process. (2) gravity separation, flotation, high intensity magnetic separation or combined process.Flotation is one of the most common methods for separating fine particles to weak magnetic iron ores.
