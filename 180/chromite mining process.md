Description. Chromium (Cr) is a hard, bluish metallic element. The only ore of chromium is the mineral chromite and 99 percent of the world's chromite is found in southern Africa and Zimbabwe. Geologists estimate that there are about 11 billion tons of mineable chromite ore in the world, enough to supply the current demand for hundreds of years.

## Samancor Chrome Mines - Mining Technology
With low electricity prices, South Africa has been able to expand chromite and ferrochrome production more or less continuously since the AOD process was developed in the 1960s to use ferrochrome smelted from lower-grade ores. Samancor was created in 1975 and its Chrome Division grew, mainly by acquisition, to become the world's largest integrated ferrochrome .
