## Crushers - QueensMineDesignWiki
Introduction. Crushers play an important role in the material handling process for underground mine operations. The main purpose of a crusher is the size reduction of the feed. This size reduction is achieved by applying a force to the material, creating cracks in the material which in the end will cause the material to break into smaller

Gyratory crushers are normally the first part of the processing plant and will often have zero redundancy. An unexpected shutdown on a gyratory crusher can reduce or eliminate crushed ore stockpile levels, causing production losses and mill instability.  All of the above can cause mill instability, high costs and less than optimum process
