## how do you differentiate between limestone and basalt
Aug 14, 2011· The key difference between basalt and granite is that basalt is mostly occurring on ocean floors, while granite is in the crust of the earth in all continents.. Earth contains three kinds of rocks namely igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks.Basalt and granite are two types of igneous rocks.

## How Are Granite And Basalt Similar - Realonomics
Jan 19, 2022What do basalt and granite have in common? Basalt and granite actually have quite a bit in common. Both are igneous rocks which means that they cooled from a magma (the earth gets very hot just below the surface and there is lots of liquid rock available). Both are made up of minerals from the silicate group so both have large amounts of silicon and oxygen.

## Which type of rock is basalt? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022How is basalt formed in the rock cycle? Basalt forms when lava reaches the Earth's surface at a volcano or mid ocean ridge. The lava is between 1100 to 1250° C when it gets to the surface. It cools quickly, within a few days or a couple weeks, forming solid rock. Very thick lava flows may take many years to become completely solid.
