## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).

Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
