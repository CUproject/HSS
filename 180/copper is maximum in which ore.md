## An ore contains 15% copper, how many kilograms will be required  - Quora
Answer: If your ore was 15% copper you would need to process 480 Kg of ore. 72100/15 = 480 15% is an extremely high concentration of copper ore In most cases copper ores contain between 0.6 and 1 per cent of copper. Consequently one tonne of ore generates a maximum 6 to 10 kilograms of copper

## Copper
The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×10 6 A/m 2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively. [12] Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver. [13], Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air.

## copper processing - Ores | Britannica
Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to
