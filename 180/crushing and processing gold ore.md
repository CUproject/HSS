## Gold ore crushing process
Gold ore crushing and grinding process: 1 Jaw crusher for coarse crushing, Choose cone crusher to fine crushing. Generally we use closed-circuit crushing, making gold ore particle size to meet the standard requirements. 2 Use the grinding mill to grind and reelect the gold ores. Recycle coarse gold in grinding circuit, improving the recovery rate.

## gold processing | Britannica
By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.
