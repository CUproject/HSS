## Iron Iron Ore Deposits In Laos
Iron ore deposits in laos. Exploitation of existing iron ore deposit is the easier part of the mining operations. The harder part is to find new ore deposits and to define their extent and the iron content grade. Exploration is the process by which the accumulations of iron ore minerals can be found in the earth's crust.
