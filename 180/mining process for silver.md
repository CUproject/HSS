## [VIDEO] The History and Process of Silver Mining
The process of mining for silver is broken down into three steps: removing ore from the earth, breaking it down and then flushing the silver from ore. The first step involves drilling holes in the silver-rich areas geologists have previously pinpointed and then inserting dynamite sticks. After the blast, miners haul the chunks of rock called

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
