Slat Belt Conveyor. Slat conveyors are a type of conveying technology that uses a chain-driven loop of slats to move product from one of its ends to another. A motor drives the chain, which causes it to cycle just as belt conveyors do. Instead of a rubber belt, this conveyor type uses slats connected to a chain, providing a rigid, flat surface for every item on the conveyor.

## Types of Conveyors | Warehouse Conveyor Technologies - Outsource Equipment
There are two basic types of conveyors: powered and gravity. Powered conveyors have some sort of external energy source to keep the items on the conveyor moving, typically by manipulating the conveyor surface. Gravity conveyors (as the name suggests) use the weight of the items being conveyed to propel them where desired.
