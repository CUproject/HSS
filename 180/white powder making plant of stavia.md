## Is Stevia Healthy? - Holistic Squid
I use the green powdered stevia.straight from the plant. Every day, I make an 'egg drink' (raw eggs, fat, water, spices plus veggies in the blender) and add 1/4 tsp stevia powder. It makes up two drinks, so I consume 1/8 tsp per drink or 1/4 tsp/day. I'm currently finding even that to be too sweet, so will reduce the amount of stevia.
