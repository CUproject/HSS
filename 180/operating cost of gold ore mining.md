In general, the overall breakdown of costs was estimated to be within the range of (43:43:14) and (45:45:10) (Mine:Mill:G & A). Significant differences in relative Milling costs were found to exist between underground and open pit mines, and in Mining and G & A costs, between gold-only mines and all mines containing copper.

## The true cost of producing an ounce of gold | Provident
These numbers report that the cost of extracting an ounce of gold is actually over $1,000 per ounce, well above the aforementioned numbers. And since gold is currently trading at just over $1,200 per ounce, it explains why mining companies have had less-than-stellar profits. Determining the costs of mining largely depend on the region as well.

## Refractory gold ores: Challenges and opportunities for a key source of 
Mar 23, 2021Operational costs per metric ton of processed ore are higher on average. Operational costs vary depending on the mining method and is notably 50 percent higher for open-pit refractory-ore projects. MineSpans data analysis shows that the increase in operational costs is primarily driven by higher consumables and energy costs (Exhibit 4).

## Rising gold mining costs Q1'21| Gold Focus | World Gold Council
Jun 30, 2021Costs in the gold mining industry increased for the second consecutive quarter in Q1'21, with the global average All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) up by 5% q-o-q to US$1,048/oz, reaching its highest level since Q2'13. This, combined with a 4% fall in the average quarterly gold price, resulted in a 14% drop in AISC margins (the gold price minus AISC) between Q4'20 and Q1'21.
