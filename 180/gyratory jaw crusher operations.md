## Gyratory Crusher Explained - saVRee
Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers.  It is worth noting that there will often be only a single primary crusher at many mining operations. As such, the primary crusher is a critical and major bottleneck machine for many mining sites, with little, or no bypass opportunities.

Typically, the minimum setting on most primary crushers will be about 4 to 6 inches, as noted above. Compression-style jaw, cone, impact crushers, and gyratory crushers are most often appropriate as primary crushing equipment types, though there can be overlap between primary and secondary crushers as far as suitable types. 2.

## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The gyratory crusher is a typical mining compression crusher, which is widely used in the coarse crushing of abrasive or high compressive strength rocks.  so the production efficiency of the gyratory crusher is that of a jaw crusher. 2-3 times as high as the production efficiency. The gyratory crusher can work continuously in a full cavity

## Crushers - QueensMineDesignWiki
• When idling jaw crushers consume approximately 50% of the power of full operation and gyratory approximately 30%. •Installation of an underground jaw crusher may cost up to six times as much as the crusher itself. • A 48 by 60 jaw crusher produces approximately 1.8 tons per horsepower-hour (2.2 t/kWh) at a 6:1 reduction ratio.
