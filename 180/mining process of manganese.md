Elemental manganese readily combines with oxygen, carbon, and silicon to form a long list of manganese minerals. Manganese ores generally contain 25 to 45 percent manganese, mostly in oxide (or hydroxide) and carbonate minerals. Manganese ores are widespread, but most of the world's supply is from a small number of manganese mining districts.

## Top 5 Manganese Mining Companies & Manganese producing Countries
Jul 13, 2022Manganese is a chemical element that is used in many different industries. It has a lot of uses and can be found in manganese mining companies, the steel industry, and the manufacturing industry. Manganese mining is an important part of this process because it provides the raw material for these industries. It also produces manganese dioxide, which can be used to make dry cell batteries.

Manganese can be mined using underground mining or surface mining methods depending on the ore deposit and the fineness of the ore (Zywicka, 2004). The inferior grade of ores in mines may undergo the beneficiation process due to increasing demand in the national and international market to upgrade the quality of the mined ore.
