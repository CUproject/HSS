Jaw crushers Jaw crushers are used for coarse grinding brittle, me-dium-hard to hard materials up to a Mohs' hardness of approx. 8.5. Here reduction ratios of up to 1:100 are pos-sible depending on the actual model concerned. Comminution in the jaw crusher takes place in a wedge-shaped crushing chamber between a fixed and flex-ible crushing jaw.
