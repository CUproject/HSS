## 2 Major Roles of Limestone in Cement Manufacturing
Sep 17, 2022The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

## Applying Limestone To The Cement Industry
For manufacturing of one ton of cement, a quantity of 1.5 ton of limestone is required. Hence, cement plants are necessarily located close to the limestone mines to minimize the transportation cost. The cement grade limestone deposits are depleting day by day because of continuous exploitation of high grade limestone over the years. Contact

## Applying Limestone To The Cement Industry And Mater
Applying Limestone To The Cement Industry And Mater. cement quality control laboratories face demanding elemental analysis requirements to determine major and minor oxides in clinker cement and raw materials such as limestone sand and bauxite some cement analyzers in the lab use dispersive xray elemental analysis technology and can be preconfigured for dedicated cement applications that can.
