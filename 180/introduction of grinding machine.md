## What is Milling Machine?- Parts, Operation, Diagram
Dec 13, 2020A milling machine is a machine tool that cuts metal as the workpiece is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The milling cutter rotates at a very high speed because of the multiple cutting edges, it cuts the metal at a very fast rate. This machine can also hold single or multiple cutters at the same time.
