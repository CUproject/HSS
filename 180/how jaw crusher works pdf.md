## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

Crushing by compression is done between two surfaces, with the work being done by one or both surfaces. For example, jaw crushers using this method of compression are suitable for reducing extremely hard and abrasive rock. As a mechanical reduction method, compression should be used for the following. If the material is hard and tough.

## What Are Jaw Crushers And How Do They Work? - High Level Platform
Jaw crushers are primary crushers used in an ore processing or mining plants. The size of these jaw crushers is determined by the square or rectangular opening from the feed opening (top of the jaws). For example, the 24 X 36 jaw crusher will have an opening of 24″ X 36″. while a 56 X 56 jaw crusher will have an opening of 56″ square.
