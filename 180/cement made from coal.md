## All Pakistan Cement Manufecturars Association
The primary raw material for cement manufacture is calcium carbonate or limestone. This is obtained from the quarry where, after the removal of overburden, the rock is blasted, loaded into trucks and transported to the crusher. A multistage crushing process reduces the rock to stone less than 25 mm in diameter.

## Emissions from the Cement Industry - State of the Planet
Cement manufacturing is highly energy- and emissions-intensive because of the extreme heat required to produce it. Producing a ton of cement requires 4.7 million BTU of energy, equivalent to about 400 pounds of coal, and generates nearly a ton of CO 2. Given its high emissions and critical importance to society, cement is an obvious place to

Aug 29, 2021Clinker is mixed with gypsum and ground into a fine powder, from which cement is made. According to calculations, a large amount of energy from coal is used to produce cement, of which it takes about 200 kg of coal to produce one ton of cement and about kg of cement to produce one cubic meter of concrete.

## Alternatives to Cement to Make Construction More Sustainable
Nov 23, 2021It is thus impossible to manufacture cement without producing CO2. Therefore, apart from reducing the amount of CO2 in concrete mixes, proposals to decarbonise cement production focus on capturing CO2 so that it is not released into the atmosphere. Using CO 2 to cure cement can avoid carbon emissions as it remains trapped in solid state.

Cement production also is a key source of CO2 emissions, due in part to the significant reliance on coal and petroleum coke to fuel the kilns for clinker production. Globally, CO2 emissions from cement production were estimated at 829 MMTCO2 in 2000 7, approximately 3.4% of global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production.

## New approach suggests path to emissions-free cement
Ordinary Portland cement, the most widely used standard variety, is made by grinding up limestone and then cooking it with sand and clay at high heat, which is produced by burning coal. The process produces carbon dioxide in two different ways: from the burning of the coal, and from gases released from the limestone during the heating.

Bricklayer of cement Mr.Joseph Aspdin of Leeds from England first made portland cement near the beginning in the 19th century by burning powdered limestone and clay in his personal kitchen stove.  substitute. PFA is a by-product of coal-burning power stations. As part of the combustion process, coal is pulverised into a powder before being
