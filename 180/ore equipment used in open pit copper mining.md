## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

Open-pit mining Pit geometry. Deposits mined by open-pit techniques are generally divided into horizontal layers called benches. The thickness (that is, the height) of the benches depends on the type of deposit, the mineral being mined, and the equipment being used; for large mines it is on the order of 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet).

## Copper Mining and Processing: Life Cycle of a Mine | Superfund
Surface mining, which includes strip mining, open-pit mining, and mountaintop removal, removes soil and rock from on top of the mineral deposit. It may begin as soon as the pre-development steps are complete. Underground mining uses shafts and tunnels to access deeply-buried mineral deposits, while the overlying rock is left in place.
