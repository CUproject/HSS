## Chromite: The only mineral ore of chromium metal - Geology
Magnesium frequently substitutes for iron in chromite. A solid solution series exists between the mineral chromite (FeCr 2 O 4) and the isomorphous mineral magnesiochromite (MgCr 2 O 4).Intermediate specimens can be rich in iron ((Fe,Mg)Cr 2 O 4) or magnesium ((Mg,Fe)Cr 2 O 4).For convenience in communication, these minerals are often referred to collectively as "chromite."

3.1 Chrome magnetic separation process. The chrome raw ore is a flotation tail ore, which is mainly formed in the chromite, and the chromite is the target recovering mineral. The dissociation degree of ferrochromium ore is low, and it has a weak magnetic property. First of all, magnetic separation processing to separate chromite.

Ferrochrome & Chrome Metal Ferrochrome, or Ferrochromium (FeCr) is a type of ferroalloy, that is, an alloy between chromium and iron, generally containing 50% - 70% chromium.  South Africa is home to the vast majority of the world's chromite deposits and is the largest ferrochrome and chromite ore producer.
