## Cranes: Everything You Need To Know - DOZR
The jib of a crane is the lattice-type structure attached to the end of the boom. Using a lattice-type build helps to reduce the weight it adds to the front of the boom. It is fixed in length and cannot be extended or retracted like a boom can. Some versions of mobile cranes have a jib fixed to the end of the boom to help move and lift materials.

## Mining - Crane 1 Services
Mining cranes and hoists must be able to operate in extreme environmental conditions — heat, vibration, abrasive dust, moisture and heavy-duty usage — that can cause corrosion and premature wear. Customizations may be required to fit your specific needs, which may include low headroom and spark- and corrosion-resistant construction.
