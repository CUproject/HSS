## Selecting feeders for optimized success : Pit & Quarry
Most commonly used ahead of a primary crusher, vibrating grizzly feeders (VGFs) are perhaps the most popular design used today. This is primarily due to their dual role as both a feeder and a scalper to bypass or reject dirt and fines. VGFs are also popular due to a long, or wide, feed opening that is favorable to being fed by a wheel loader.
