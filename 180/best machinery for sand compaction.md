The final compaction with a VF will compact the very top and leave a smooth and flat surface for the concrete. The cost will be two man days labor plus 1 1/2 day rental on the JJ and 1/2 day rent on the VF. Sand is NOT the best base to try and compact. Straight Crusher Run, a mix of very fine dust to about 1 1/2" diameter gravel is the best, IMHO.

What is compaction? Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, reducing pore space between them (Figure 1). Heavily compacted soils contain few large pores, less total pore volume and, consequently, a greater density. A compacted soil has a reduced rate of both water infiltration and drainage. This happens because large pores more effectively move water downward through
