## Radium - Element information, properties and uses | Periodic Table
Radium is present in all uranium ores, and could be extracted as a by-product of uranium refining. Uranium ores from DR Congo and Canada are richest in radium. Today radium is extracted from spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors. Annual production of this element is fewer than 100 grams per year. Help text not available for this section currently

## the two elements that are commonly bonded to metals in ores
Ore minerals are minerals from which metals or other elements can be profitably recovered. A few, such as native gold and native silver, are composed of a single element. However, most metals are chemically bonded to anions. Copper, lead, and zinc are commonly bonded to sulfur to form the important ore minerals chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite.

During extraction of metals from oxide ores, the reduction of metal ore to crude metal can be carried out by using several methods such as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy and electrometallurgy. Various reducing agents such as carbon, hydrogen, aluminum or other metals can be used. CO also reduces metal ores to crude metals.
