## Germany's Post-World War I Scheme to Extract Gold from Water - Gizmodo
This bizarre scheme appeared financially viable at first. Haber initially estimated that sixty-five miligrams of gold could extracted from a metric ton of seawater. To extract gold, Haber planned

## Extracting Gold from Seawater - Gold Refining & Metal Extraction Forum
In other words, only 2% of the amperage is depositing gold and 98% is doing something else. It would take 50 times more amperage to deposit a gram of gold from a 2% efficient solution than it would from a 100% efficient solution. At a seawater concentration of .0088mg/m3, that would be .g/l.
