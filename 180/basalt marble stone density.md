## Difference Between Basalt and Granite
The key difference between basalt and granite is that basalt is mostly occurring on ocean floors, while granite is in the crust of the earth in all continents.. Earth contains three kinds of rocks namely igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks.Basalt and granite are two types of igneous rocks. All rocks of igneous origin consist of magma or molten earth that finds its way up to

## Basalt Rock Properties and Uses - Science Struck
Density. The density of basalt is quite high, which can be seen through the combination of the rocks porosity: 0.1 - 1%, and its bulk density: 2.8 - 3 Mg  The Rosetta stone is also made of basalt. Construction. There are a number of uses of this rock in construction. For example, crushed basalt is used to make the base for roads and

## Natural stone strength (compression, bending, and abrasion) test
Bending strength test. This test is compulsory for knowing about the power of the stone in bending. There are three common types of tests done for the same purpose. Modulus of rupture test - application of the load at a mid-point. ASTM C99 test and ASTM C120 (Slate) test - application of the load at a mid-point.
