## Coal Rank - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal rank is a measure of coal maturity and is the most fundamental parameter that relates both to the coalification history and the utilisation potential of a coal. Figure 14.3 shows the change in coal chemical and physical properties with rank from bituminous to anthracite coals (Teichmuller and Teichmuller, 1975).As the rank increases, the vitrinite reflectance, carbon content, and C/H

Coal Classification.

There are several classifications; we use the ASTM classification by rank, which is based on fixed carbon and gross calorific value.

Coal is a readily combustible rock containing more than 50 percent by weight of carbonaceous material formed from compaction and indurations of variously altered plant remains similar to those in peat.. After a considerable amount of time, heat, and burial pressure, it is metamorphosed from peat to lignite.

The rank of a coal is characteristic of the stage reached by it in course of coalification. The development from peat through the stages of lignite, subbituminous, and bituminous coals to anthracite and meta-anthracite is termed coalification. Coalification or coal metamorphism is a function of heat and pressure acting over a period of time.
