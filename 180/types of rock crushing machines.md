Crushers may be used to reduce the size of materials, or change the form of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials so that pieces of different composition can be easy for next step separation.

The rock that is extracted from quarries is in large chunks, and so the first step in processing it is putting the rock that has been extracted from the ground through stone crushing equipment. This creates pieces of rock that are easier to process. Often this crusher leads the rock, by conveyor belt, to another crusher.
