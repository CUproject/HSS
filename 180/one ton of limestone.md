## How many tons of limestone does it take to produce one ton of cement 
It takes between pounds of raw material to make one ton of cement, the bulk of the raw material being limestone. Let's say the ratio is 1.5 tons limestone for every 1.0 ton of cement.

## Limestone conversion from ton to cubic yard - Forums
Re: Limestone conversion from ton to cubic yard I have no idea what #610 Limestone is, but I found the following: Limestone, solid - 2.2 ton/cubic yard Limestone, broken - 1.3 ton/cubic yard Limestone, pulverized 1.17 ton/cubic yard Determine if any of the above are close, then divide how many tons you need by the above density to get cubic yards.

## How many yards are in a ton of gravel? (with Online Calculator)
Apr 22, 2022As, 2000 pounds equals 1 ton. Therefore 2835 pound per cubic yard equals to 1.42 tons in 1 cubic yard. As we did in above procedure. So, in short, for ½ to 2-inch wet gravel. 1 yard of gravel = 1.42 tons. So, number of yards in 1 ton = 1/1.42 = 0.704. In 3 tons of gravel there are 3 x 0.704 = 2.11 yards.
