## Reducing Water Use in Food Processing - Oklahoma State University
Water is extensively used in most food plants as a processing aid and for cleanup and sanitizing. Conservation and reuse of water saves money and reduces a food company's exposure to rising water costs and potential shortages (Schug, 2016). The purpose of this fact sheet is to help food processors reduce water usage by introducing concepts

## Water Usage and Why We Should Reduce It - The Balance Small Business
Around 120 gallons of water is required to produce one egg. About 300 gallons of water is needed to produce one loaf of bread, and it takes about 12,000 gallons of water to grow a bushel of wheat. Believe it or not, about 1,400 gallons of water are used during the final production of one fast-food meal including a burger, fries, and a soft drink.
