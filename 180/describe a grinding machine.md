## How to Use a Surface Grinder Machine - American Machine Tools
A surface grinding machine is used to produce a smooth accurate finish on either metallic or nonmetallic materials. It uses a round rotating abrasive grinding wheel that remains stationary (but rotating) while the feed table (with work attached) is run in a reciprocating motion (left and right) under the grinding wheel.

## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
Grinding Machine. A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool.; These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.

## What is a Drilling Machine - Drilling Machine Definition, Parts, Types 
A drilling machine, also called a drill press, is a powerful tool used to cut a round hole into or through metal, plastic, wood, or other solid materials through turning and advancing rotary drill bits into a workpiece. This drilling cutting tool is held in the drill press by a chuck and fed into the work at variable speeds.
