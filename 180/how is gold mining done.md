## Gold mining in Colorado
Gold mining in Colorado, a state of the United States, has been an industry since 1858.It also played a key role in the establishment of the state of Colorado.. Explorer Zebulon Pike heard a report of gold in South Park, present-day Park County, Colorado, in 1807.. Gold discoveries in Colorado began around Denver; prospectors traced the placer gold to its source in the mountains west of Denver

## Effects of Gold Mining on the Environment - Clean Mining
The large-scale practice of mining gold from ore can have tremendous negative effects on water quality. Gold typically sits in ore and sediment that contains toxins such as mercury. When rivers are dredged to mine large placer deposits of gold, these toxins float downstream and enter the food web, as they have done in California's South Yuba

Seismic Method. Surface seismic techniques used in gold exploration are restricted to seismic refraction and seismic reflection methods. Probably, the first one is the most employed. The equipment employed for both techniques is very similar and assure the travel time of acoustic waves propagating through the subsurface.

Gold and silver form an alloy that is heavier than the slag and sinks to the bottom of the furnace. Once the smelting is complete, the slag is removed and the precious metals are casted in ingots. The slag contains gold and silver and must be reprocessed in order to minimize the losses of precious metals.
