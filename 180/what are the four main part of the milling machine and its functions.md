## Milling Machines; What are They and What Do They Do? | DTS - DTS UK Ltd
Milling machines are a type of machinery for removing material from a workpiece using rotary cutters. These machines can drill, bore, and cut an array of materials. This process of removing pieces of the material in line with the tool axis is known as milling, and thus the machines used in the process are called milling machines. Milling

It implements interpolation ( linear, circular and helical ) to generate axis motion commands.

## What Are The Four Main Part Of The Milling Machine And Its Functions
 Today we will learn about milling machine parts and its working. Milling machine is used to machining the metal workpiece by a revolving cutting tool. The milling cutter usually used to cut the metal perpendicular to the tool axis.
