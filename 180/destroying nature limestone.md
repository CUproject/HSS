## How the Taliban's destruction of giant Buddha statues led to important 
In 2001, Afghanistan's Taliban government destroyed the statues because they were un-Islamic. But their destruction has led to a number of new discoveries. Before the Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed, they were the largest standing Buddha carvings in the world. One statue was 115 feet tall, the other was 174 feet tall.

## What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? | eHow
As acid rain falls to the earth's surface, limestone rocks and limestone components in soil will react with the rain, neutralize the acid and dissolve. As the limestone dissolves, the rocks will wear away, becoming pitted with rounded edges. The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time.
