## Summary of Surface Blasting and Damages with Analysis of Two Mitigation 
The main objective of smooth blasting is to leave a small berm of rock between the final face and the main blast, and then blast the berm with tightly spaced, lightly loaded blast holes. This forms a continuous crack between holes, giving an evenly contoured final face while keeping large blasts at great enough of a distance to limit damaging

INTRODUCTION. In mountain region of the Hyrcanian forests of IR-Iran, road building is difficult due to larger quantities of stones and rocks (Woltjer et al., 2008; Parsakhoo et al., 2008a).Thus at these regions, rock breaking is frequently performed by use of explosive agents with traditional methods of blasting such as dynamite and non-explosive demolition agents such as expansive chemical

Environmental Damaged by Dust and Noise. Blasting as well as other activities associated with mine development and operation can cause noise, dust, and vibration. The environmental effects of noise and dust vary depending not only on the size and location of the blast but also on atmospheric conditions such as wind and humidity.

## How to Conduct Blasting Operations Safely? [PDF]
Blasting is a process of reduction of rocks or hard soil into fragments with the help of explosives. The blasting operation involves drilling of holes, installation of a detonator and charge, detonating the charge, and removal of debris. In this article, we discuss how to safely conduct blasting operations in hard rock or soil.

The second effect of blasting, which is "unseen", is the crack generation that occurs within fragments. There is substantial evidence that such cracking occurs. The work by Nielsen and Kristiansen (Fragblast5, 1996) is an excellent example.

First the rock will enter the crushing chamber and drop as far as the angle of the crushing surface will allow it to. The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle and the liner as it opens. The coarse material that can't fall through will remain to be crushed with the next gyration.

Energy density and the parameters that affect it appear to be crucial in an effort to increase the number of micro cracks, and therefore softening, in the blast block. The rock type, explosive selection, blast pattern selection, millisecond delay times, and timing rotation all affect the manner in which energy distributes throughout the rock mass.

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining - Seattle PI
Limestone mines use two types of blasting. Small explosive charges set along drilled lines free blocks of stone to be removed for construction. Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.

conditions affect the degree of fragmentation of rock. The blasting operation causes the rock fail due to crushing, tensile fracture, release of load, strain energy generation, shearing action,flexural rupture etc. After an explosive is initiated, the site around the drill hole will crush and will deform plastically.

Abstract. A new three-parameter fragment size distribution function has been found that links rock fragmentation by blasting and crushing. The new Swebrec© function gives excellent fits to hundreds of sets of sieved fragmentation data with correlation coefficients of 0·997 or better (r 2 >0·995) over a range of fragment sizes of 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Jun 21, 2021Rock blasting is the process of drilling holes in a rock mass at depths, and spacing to allow an explosive to fracture the rock. In this process, the rock must fracture enough to be broken down to the size intended. It is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering such as dam, tunnel, or road construction.
