## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

## Choosing the Right Rock Crushing Equipment - Amcast
Gyratory Crusher. A gyratory crusher consists of a concave surface and a conical head constructed from heavy steel casting. It works by using a mantle that gyrates within a concave bowl. This rock crushing equipment uses compressive force to fracture the rock and this happens when the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration.
