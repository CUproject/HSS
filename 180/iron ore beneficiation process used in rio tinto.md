This is because, in addition to standardising the quality of the parties' iron ore products, the joint venture would further increase the already significant commonality of costs of BHPB's and Rio's iron ore. As BHPB and Rio would share costs on a 50-50 basis under the joint venture, they would essentially have the same production costs.
