## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
What is a crusher? A crusher is a machine that is designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust. Crushers may be used to reduce the size of materials, or change the form of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials so that pieces of different composition can be easy for next step separation.

Particle sizes range from 100mm to 10mm during this final stage. Tertiary crushing is highly valuable in the mineral processing industry. The degree to which a material is reduced largely depends on how fine the material's final size should be. More rounds of crushing equal smaller-sized results.
