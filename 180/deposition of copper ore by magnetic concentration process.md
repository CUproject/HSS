Ores are solid materials that can be used to produce pure metals. Concentration, dressing, or benefaction of ores is extracting undesirable particles from ore. There are various steps to it. The variations in physical characteristics of the existing metal complex and that of the gangue are used to separate the needed material from the ore.

In this process the insoluble sulphide is converted into soluble sulphate and elemental sulphur. 4. Magnetic separation. This method is applicable to ferromagnetic ores and it is based on the difference in the magnetic roperties of the ore and the impurities. For example tin stone can be separated from the wolframite impurities which is magnetic.

Present Practice and State of Development. The largest development in the iron-ore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used.

Apr 28, 2022Points To Remember. Concentration of ore is the process used to extract useful minerals by separating the gangue particles. Concentration of ore can be done by 4 methods: Hydraulic Washing, Magnetic Separation, Froth Floatation, Leaching. Hydraulic washing depends upon the weights of the metal and gangue particles.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.
