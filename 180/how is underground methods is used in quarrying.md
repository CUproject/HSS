The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining.  What is a quarry used for? A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine, because it is open to the Earth's surface. Another type of mine, a sub-surface mine, consists of underground tunnels or shafts.

Quarries are normally shallower than other kinds of open-pit mines. Quarries are also at times used as filming locations. In other words a quarry is a big man-made hole in the ground from where minerals or rock are taken out. Quarries are made when big deposits of commercially helpful minerals or rock are found close to the Earth's surface.

## How Does Mining Work? | Surface Mining | Underground Mining
Surface Mining. Used to mine the metals and minerals present near the earth's surface, surface mining is a much more economically viable option than underground mining. The three basic types of surface mining are quarry mining, strip mining, and open pit mining. Used to obtain all minerals except coal, open pit mining involves making cuts into the ground and working the area at that depth

## Quarrying | Process and Equipment | Applications | Epiroc US
The concept of quarrying has been around since the dawn of civilization, with many different working techniques having been developed. A quarry is typically defined as being a surface excavation for the production of rock as the principal product. As such, it differs from an open cast, open-cut, surface or open-pit mine in that the rock itself

Apr 1, 2021Bench blasting is a common technique used in open-pit mines. It is blasting in a vertical or sub-vertical hole or a row of holes towards a free vertical surface. More than one row of holes can be blasted in the same round. A time delay in the detonation between the rows creates new free surfaces for each row.
