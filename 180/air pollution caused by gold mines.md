## Pollution From Mining - The World Counts
The water pollution is caused by acid that drains from the "Iron Mountain" mine, known as acid drainage. Acid drainage is serious stuff. With a pH value of 0, the groundwater near the "Iron Mountain" has been found to be 10,000 times more acidic than battery acid (this is VERY acidic). It's the highest concentration of acid in the world.

Mining also leads to air pollution. For mining purposes, big machines are often used in order to make the mining process more effective and to reduce the physical work for miners. However, these machines emit large amounts of harmful gases, also including greenhouse gases like methane or CO2. Thus, mining can also cause air pollution and the

## Mining and Water Quality | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of underground mining. Underground mining causes huge amounts of waste earth and rock to be brought to the surface - waste that often becomes toxic when it comes into contact with air and water. It causes subsidence as mines collapse and the land above it starts to sink. This causes serious damage to buildings.

## Preliminary review of mine air pollution in Zambia - ScienceDirect
Effects of mine air pollution on human and animal health. Studies elsewhere have revealed that air pollution can have devastating effects on human health (Bernstein et al., 2004; Tao et al., 2003). According to the World Bank (2005), urban air pollution is estimated to cause 250,000 deaths and millions of cases of respiratory illnesses every year.

Feb 13, 2021When gold is excavated and heated during processing, mercury can be released into the air. As a result, air pollution regulations have been developed in recent years for gold mining. The toxic effects of mercury have been known for more than 100 years as has the fact that naturally-occurring mercury often is present in or around gold bearing ore.

Air Pollution. The toxicity of air pollution and dust may vary, but high levels of arsenic, lead, and radionuclides tend to pose the greatest risk. Air pollution occurs at mining sites during excavation and transportation. Blowing dust from AML sites is a common concern, as many mines are in arid western states.

Gold mining is one of the most destructive industries in the world. It can displace communities, contaminate drinking water, hurt workers, and destroy pristine environments. It pollutes water and land with mercury and cyanide, endangering the health of people and ecosystems. Producing gold for one wedding ring alone generates 20 tons of waste.

Mining provides essential raw materials for an industrialized society. However, it causes serious pollution of surface and groundwater. Transferring minerals from deep below the surface to the surface promotes oxidation reactions. Oxidation of iron salts and of sulfur-containing materials in the presence of water leads to highly acidic solutions.
