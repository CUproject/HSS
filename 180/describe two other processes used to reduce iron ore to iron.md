Smelting Wikipedia. Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal is a form of extractive metallurgy is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## Describe Two Other Processes Used To Reduce Iron Ore To
Oct 26, 2020· One of the most important uses of iron ore is steel production, accounting for the bulk of iron ore processed annually. Iron-rich ores have a number of other uses, some of which are literally quite colorful; they are used in cosmetics, for example, and in .

## Direct-Reduced Iron - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Direct reduced iron is iron ore in the form of lumps, fines or pellets that have had the oxygen removed by using hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Typical sources of carbon monoxide are natural gas, coal gas, and coal. Other energy inputs into the production process often include oil and electricity. Since much of the energy used is in the form of

## Pig Iron Manufacturing Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Pig Iron. At the beginning of the use of the electric furnace, for the manufacture of calcium carbide and ferro-alloys, experimental work was conducted in it upon the production of steel from iron ore. For many years steel and wrought iron have been produced directly from ore on a small scale in the forge, crucible, and reverberatory furnaces

2 is used to reduce iron ore pellets to direct reduced iron DRI, or sponge iron The reaction takes place in a shaft furnace, a type of furnace that uses gas reductants to make DRI The operating temperature can be fairly low, around 800 176 C The DRI is then fed into an EAF and turned into steel by further processing it and adding carbon
