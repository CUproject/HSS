## Lead Zinc Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Major mine producers other than the U.S. include Australia, Canada, China, Peru, and Kazakhstan. In the U.S., six lead mines in Missouri, plus lead-producing mines in Alaska and Idaho, accounted for all domestic mine production. Significant amounts of lead are recovered as a by-product or co-product from zinc mines, and silver-copper deposits.
