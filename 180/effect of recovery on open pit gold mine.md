## What Is The Most Likely Consequence Of Open Pit Mining On Plant Life 
Open-pit mining includes blasting of soil and vegetation to access underground ore layers or coal seams [17]. Consequently this method produces large volumes of mining waste including soil and overburden which increase the vulnerability of mining environments to soil erosion and pollution.

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining Methods Compared 
Underground mining, where miners tunnel beneath the Earth's surface to extract mineral deposits, is rarer than open-pit mining. In 2014, it made up about 5% of all American mining operations — and has less of an impact on the surface. However, this doesn't mean that underground mining doesn't have an effect on the environment.

## Environmental Impacts of Gold Mining - Earthworks
Gold mining is one of the most destructive industries in the world. It can displace communities, contaminate drinking water, hurt workers, and destroy pristine environments. It pollutes water and land with mercury and cyanide, endangering the health of people and ecosystems. Producing gold for one wedding ring alone generates 20 tons of waste.

## How to Profit from Low-Grade Gold Mines - SmallCapPower
Generally speaking, one gram per tonne works for open-pit mines, but underground gold mines require at least 2.5 g/t to be economic. Open-pit mining is either done with a fleet of haul trucks (some now automated) or an in-pit crushing and conveying system (IPCC). Underground mines are accessed via a shaft or ramp.

Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

Typical Open Cut Grades Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 2 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%.
