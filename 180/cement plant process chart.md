## How Cement Is Made
The heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns, a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency. After the clinker is cooled, cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone. Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix

## How to improve cement plant process for better cement quality
In order to improve cement quality of cement plant, we must first control the raw material source of cement plant. For raw materials were supplied by many clinker plants and the sources were complicated. According to the production needs of cement plants, the strength of incoming clinker should be controlled within the range of 28 ~32MPa, and 1

Cement production is a highly energy-intensive process. Cement making consists of three major process steps: raw material preparation, clinker making in the kiln, and cement making. Raw material preparation and cement making are the main electricity-consuming processes, whereas the clinker kiln uses nearly all of the fuel in a typical cement plant.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing plant by trucks, railway
