## How does concrete damage the environment? - Concrete Recruiters
Jul 6, 2022Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to surface runoff that can lead to soil erosion, water pollution and flooding. Among the main ingredients of ordinary cement are pulverized limestone, clay and sand, which are heated to a high temperature. This process is responsible for 5 to 8% of all carbon dioxide emissions in the world.
