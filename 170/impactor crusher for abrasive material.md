The primary impact crushers are used to process from 200 t/h up to 1900 t/h and feed sizes of up to 1830 mm (71") in the largest model. Primary impact crushers are generally used in nonabrasive applications and where the production of fines is not a problem. Of all primary crushers, the impactor is the crusher that gives the best cubical product.

## What is an Impact Crusher?
Dec 9, 2021Impact Crushers produce the most uniform cubical shape for finished products, due to its consistent ability to uniformly break apart aggregates through striking. Striking can be done with rapid moving hammers as seen on the Horizontal Shaft Impactor or being thrown against an anvil or rock wall as seen on the Vertical Shaft Impactor.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
