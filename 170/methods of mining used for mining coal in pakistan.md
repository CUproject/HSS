## Coal extraction method -surface, deep underground mining techniques
Underground mining: Coal at a depth of 180 to 300 ft (50 to 100 m) is deep mined, however in some cases the technique of surface mining are implemented. Underground mining is undergone when the coal is present at the depth of 180 to 350 feet. Room and pillar mining and longwall mining are the two types of underground mining.

## Commonly used mining techniques to extract coal - NS Energy
As mining of coal depends on the depth and quality of the coal seams, different techniques are used to dig the deposits. Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction.

Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide. At least 60 feet of coal was left between an underground mine and the surface, if not the surface had a higher

Mining Methods. Area mining (strip mining) Surficial method; used in large areas of relatively low-relief; often open-pit. Used for shallow, bedded deposits (e.g. coal seams). Dragline shovels remove overburden; after deposit is removed, overburden is placed back in the void, probably after mining the created highwall using other methods.

Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes.
