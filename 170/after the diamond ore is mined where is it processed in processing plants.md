## How Are Diamonds Mined and Processed?
These diamond deposits are called Secondary deposits. Diamonds are usually brought from the mantle, where the precious diamonds are formed due to volcanic eruptions. At the time of the journey, a hard rock protects these diamonds, and these hard rocks are known as Kimberlite. At present, three types of diamond mining methods are used mainly.

## OPP: Ore Preparation Plants Explained | Oil Sands Magazine
OPPs are normally built closer to the mine pit, which can sometimes be a considerable distance away from the processing plant. Since the oil sands ore is mined out of a pit (or hole in the ground), the crushing plant is normally also installed at a lower elevation, or in-pit. This helps minimize elevation changes for the haul trucks.

Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers.

Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters. When the diamond-rich depth is reached, the raw

First, to access the actual seams or veins of ore, the top layers of rock or overburden must be removed. Once the overburden has been removed, the seams can be extracted. When extracting the seams, there is additional waste rock that must be separated from the ore. This additional waste rock is called gangue.

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed. The aim of this is to reduce the undesirable high proportion of admixtures to a desired minimum in order to increase the iron content. This is done by processes such as flotation or magnetic separation.
