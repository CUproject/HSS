## Whats a yard of gravel? Explained by FAQ Blog
How many yards is 3 tons gravel? A general rule of thumb when converting cubic yards of gravel to tons is to multiply the cubic area by 1.4. For your reference, gravel typically weighs 2,800 pounds per cubic yard.  Take the total and divide by 21.6 (the amount of cubic feet in a ton). The final figure will be the estimated amount of tons
