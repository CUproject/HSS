## Slag
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

## Towards Sustainable Self-Compacting Concrete: Effect of Recycled Slag 
Based on the research, concerning the use of steel slag as coarse aggregate in SCC and presented in this paper, the following are observed: (1) The use of steel slag in SCC, as coarse aggregate, is possible and thus beneficial for the environment where the slag can be dumped in concrete rather than the soil. Hence, green SCC can be produced.

The results show that for the five samples, the 7 days' compressive strength was about 29.94 on average; and for 28 days' compressive strength, the strength was 41.65 on average. The results show that self-consolidate concrete has satisfactory qualities.

Copper slag Copper slag is a byproduct generated from refining of copper and it is also considered as a waste material. For every ton of refined copper, about 2.2 to 2.5 tons of waste slag is produced, which could be used as a replacement material for aggregates in concrete. Thus, copper slag possesses similar properties that of the sand.

## Compressive Strength Prediction of Self-Compacting Concrete-A Bat 
Jun 4, 2022This article examines the feasibility of using bat-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the compressive strength of self-compacting concrete (SCC). The nonlinear behavior of SCC challenges traditional modeling techniques. Therefore, this work takes advantage of the superior predictive performance of ANNs coupled with the bat algorithm. A database of 205 SCC samples collected

## Sustainability | Free Full-Text | Utilization of Fly Ash as a Viscosity 
Sufficient deformability can be achieved in concrete while maintaining segregation resistance either by using a chemical viscosity-modifying admixture (VMA) or increasing the fine content in the concrete. Using VMA, the initial cost of self-compacting concrete (SCC) increases, making it unsuitable for general construction. As a result, alternative methods for lowering the cost of SCC must be

Aug 3, 2022It should be noted that in SCC, like SCLC, increasing the copper slag level improved the workability of concrete. Adding copper slag up to 15% of cement weight increased the strength of SCLC up to 19%. Using 15% copper slag in the mix design increased the compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths of SCLC by about 17%, 19%, and 12%, respectively.

Vanadium is a chemical element with the symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery-grey, malleable transition metal.The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, the formation of an oxide layer (passivation) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation..

An investigation is carried out on the development of Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) using copper slag (CS) as fine aggregates with partial and full replacement of sand. Six different SCC mixes (60% OPC and 40% Fly Ash) with 0% as control mix, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of copper slag substituting sand with constant w/b ratio of 0.45 were cast

## Carbonation Resistance of Self-Compacting Concrete Incorporating Copper 
The aim of present investigation is to evaluate the carbonation resistance of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing copper slag (CS) as fine aggregates. A total of 18 mixes were prepared, which were divided in to three series, namely CS-based mixes (Series 1), CS-based mixes with silica fume (Series 2), and CS-based mixes with metakaolin
