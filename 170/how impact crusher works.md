## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the high-speed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again. This process is repeated until the material is
