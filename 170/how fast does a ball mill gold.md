The critical speed of ball mill is given by, n c = 1 2 π g R − r. where R = radius of ball mill; r = radius of ball. For R = 1000 mm and r = 50 mm, n c = 30.7 rpm. But the mill is operated at a speed of 15 rpm. Therefore, the mill is operated at 100 x 15/30.7 = 48.86 % of critical speed. If 100 mm dia balls are replaced by 50 mm dia balls

Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
