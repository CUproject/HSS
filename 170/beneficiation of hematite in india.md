## Development of Hematite Beneficiation and Pellet Technology of India 
The sulphur and phosphor quantity contained in Indian hematite are also relatively high, so it's difficult for beneficiation. The hardness of the India's low grade hematite is low, which gives advantage of low energy consumption when crushing and grinding, while the disadvantage is the ore easily to be slimed and after sliming the ore can be
