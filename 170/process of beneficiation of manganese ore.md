## Beneficiation method and technological process of manganese oxide ore 
The manganese minerals in the manganese oxide ore are mainly manganese ore, pyrolusite and hydromanganese ore, and the gangue minerals are mainly silicate minerals and carbonate minerals, often accompanied by iron, phosphorus and nickel, cobalt and other components. The beneficiation method of manganese oxide ore is mainly re-election.
