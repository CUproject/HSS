## Iron ore crushing and screening process
Aug 3, 20222. Iron ore screening process: Iron ore screening equipment generally uses a circular vibrating screen to screen the materials after the second crushing. Generally, materials with a size of 10mm or less can be screened for dry selection. After screening, materials with a size of 10-40mm enter the fine crusher for fine crushing.

Steelmaking starts with melting the raw inputs of iron ore, coke (produced by carbonisation of coking coal) and limestone together in a blast furnace. The resulting red hot molten iron contains 4-4.5% carbon and other impurities that make it brittle. So we need to move to further process the steel to achieve the desired.

## compressive strength for iron ore for cone crusher
Jaw crusher can crush all kinds of soft and hard materials with compressive strength between Mpa, such as granite, quartzite, diabase, pebble, iron ore, etc. Hammer crusher is mainly used to crush ores with low hardness, and its compressive strength is generally lower than 200Mpa, such as limestone, bluestone, coal gangue, etc.

## Cold Compression Strength (CCS) Test RB 1000 - RB Automazione
General description. According to ISO 4700, ASTM E 382 and IS 8625 Standards, RB 1000 is a fully automatic system for determination of the crushing strength of fired iron ore pellets and reduced iron ore pellets, by measuring continuously sample dimensions and crushing load. The equipment consists of a loading unit, with an automatic handler
