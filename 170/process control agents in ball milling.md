##  The effect of the amount of process control agent on the properties of 
ball mill. The effect of amount of stearic acid on production of Cu25W composite powder was evaluated. In order to achieve true alloying among powder particles, it is necessary to establish a balance between cold welding and fracturing. Hence, different types of process control agents (PCA) were used to reduce excessive cold welding.

Fe-Si-B-P-Cu nanocrystalline alloy were treated with ball-mill using a lubricant as a process control agent (PCA). The resulting alloy powder is a strong candidate material for soft magnetic composites. Two ball milling methods (continuous and interval) were employed to control the interactions between the PCA and the alloy surface, and

## Influence of process control agent (PCA) and atmosphere during high 
High-energy ball milling (HEM) with subsequent consolidation is a suitable method to create particle-reinforced aluminium materials. In addition to other parameters, the used PCA (process control agent) as well as the atmosphere significantly influence the milling procedure. After numerous scientific contributions in the field of aluminium
