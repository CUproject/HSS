## A geomechanics classification for the rating of railroad subgrade 
Dec 5, 2021The understanding and knowledge about the deformation and failure mechanisms of the geomaterials under repeated loadings are extremely important for the proper design and maintenance planning in the railway structures [1,2,3,4].Typically, the subgrade layer of railway track is composed of geomaterials (mainly coarse-grained soils due to its better performance when compared to the fine-grained

## 12. Railway track ballast | Geological Society, London, Engineering 
Abstract. Railway track formations generally consist essentially of a layer of coarse aggregate, or ballast, in which the sleepers are embedded (see Fig. 12.1). The ballast may rest directly on the subgrade or, depending on the bearing capacity, on a layer of blanketing sand. The layer of ballast is intended to provide a free draining base

Subgrade and Formation. Subgrade and Formation - Introduction. Subgrade is the naturally occuring soil which is prepared to receive the ballast. The prepared flat surface, which is ready to receive the ballast, sleepers, and rails, is called the formation. The formation is an important constituent of the track, as it supports the entire track .

## Subgrade
In transport engineering, subgrade is the native material underneath a constructed road, pavement or railway track (US: railroad track). It is also called formation level.. The term can also refer to imported material that has been used to build an embankment.. Construction. Subgrades are commonly compacted before the construction of a road, pavement or railway track

##  Effect of Railway Track Elements Properties on Stresses Distribution
The railway track elements (iron rail bars, concrete sleepers, crushed stone layers, base or ballast layer and the subgrade layer) play an important role to resist the stresses resulting from the movement of trains on this track line, the basic purpose for the railway components to transfer resulting stresses safely to earth's natural layer.
