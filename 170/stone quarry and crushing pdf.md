## Stone Crushing - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Oct 20, 2020Quarries are of two different types, the pit quarry and the bank quarry. The pit quarry is one in which the stone is extracted from below the general level of the surrounding country, and, as a rule, the stone is elevated to the crushing and treatment plant on the surface. Some operations in limestone and granite are of this type.
