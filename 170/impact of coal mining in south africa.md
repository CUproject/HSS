Description: In South Africa, 90% of the nation's electricity is coal-powered. The country is also the seventh largest coal producer worldwide and is the ninth largest for carbon dioxide emissions per capita. Consequently, more than 2,200 people die every year in South Africa from the consequences of air pollution from coal-fired power plants.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

##  COAL MINING AND THE ENVIRONMENT - University of the Western Cape
The environmental impacts of coal mining in South Africa are reviewed. The primary impacts arise from mining, particularly underground mining, largely because South African coal mines are relatively shallow. Coal washing gives rises to large waste dumps, which may ignite spontaneously and cause air pollution.
