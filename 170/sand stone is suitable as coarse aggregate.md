## Why are fine and coarse aggregates used in concrete? - Short-Fact
Which coarse aggregate is suitable for concrete? In the majority of concrete works, aggregate sizes of 20 mm or smaller are used. To ensure good coarse aggregate compaction and higher concrete density, it is recommended to mix 20 mm and 10 mm coarse aggregates in the ratio of 70:30 or 60:40.

Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial, both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water, while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.

## Sand Stone Is Suitable As Coarse Aggregate
Effect Of Aggregates On The Properties Of Concrete. An aggregate having angularity number between zero to 11 is con sidered suitable for making concrete Zero angularity represents the most suitable rounded aggregate and angularity number 11 indicates the most angular aggregate that can be tolerated for making concrete not unduly harsh and uneconomical

## Aggregate Size In Concrete | Coarse Vs Fine Aggregate - Union Quarries
Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate: Coarse aggregates generally consist of types of gravel. A cement mix using coarse aggregate may use a majority of coarse aggregate with a fine aggregate like crushed stone filling up the remainder. Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of

## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.

## Cement all mixing ratioofy
The nominal concrete mix of a fixed proportion of cement, sand and aggregate provide considerable variation in strength resulting in the poor or over-rich mix. Hence minimum compressive strength has been assigned in many proportions and termed as the standard mix. As per IS 456:2000 Standard Concrete grades are M 25, M 30, M 35,
