## Pyrite Uses - Crystal Benefits
Pyrite is an iron sulfide which is found in abundance on the Earth. It boasts of being the most common sulfide mineral found on the planet. Owing to its brass-yellow metallic luster, it resembles gold to a certain extent, which has earned it the nickname, 'fool's gold' in areas where it is quite popular.

## Pyrite | Common Minerals
In Our Society: The Economic Importance of Pyrite. Despite being a common, iron-rich mineral, pyrite is rarely mined for its own sake, and most of our iron is produced from magnetite and hematite deposits. Those iron oxide minerals occur in larger concentrations and volumes than pyrite, so they are a more economical iron source.
