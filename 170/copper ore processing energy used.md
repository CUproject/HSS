## Copper Smelting Process - Furnaces Used, By-Products, and Process Used 
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Copper was one of the first metals ever extracted and used by humans, and it has made vital contributions to sustaining and improving society since the dawn of civilization. Copper was first used in coins and ornaments starting about 8000 B.C., and at about 5500 B.C., copper tools helped civilization emerge from the Stone Age.

the best use of the mined ore feed. The biggest savings will be achieved in comminution energy, as coarse flotation requires less grinding. In most mineral beneficiation plants, the largest cost is the energy used to grind the ore; comminution uses at least 3% of total global electricity production, and according to the Coalition for.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Sustainable Use of Copper Resources  - MDPI
The global market has announced copper as a modern energy metal and finds its extensive utilization in the construction industry, electrical wiring, power transmission lines, alloying, anticorrosive coating, heat exchangers, refrigeration tubing, etc. Copper ore is primarily beneficiated from sulphide mineral deposits. Due to high-grade copper sulphide deposit exhaustion, the focus has now

## Current Energy Requirements in the Copper Producing Industries
An analysis of energy usage in the production of refined cathode copper was made from mining ore to cathode copper. In mining copper ore the greatest energy consumers are ore hauling and blasting. Another important factor is the "recovery efficiency" of the metallurgical processes used to extract the copper. The mining and mineral concentrating energies are directly proportional to the

## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.
