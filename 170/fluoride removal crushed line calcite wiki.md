## Modified Crushed Oyster Shells for Fluoride Removal from Water
Oyster shells are a rich source of calcium carbonate 10,11,12 that can be used for fluoride removal 13. Calcium carbonate can be used to produce hydroxyapatite which has been shown to be effective for fluoride removal from water 14. Phosphoric acid-enhanced limestone has improved fluoride removal efficiency and is a low-cost material 15.

## fluoride removal crushed limestone calcite wiki
Impact of Phosphate on Fluoride Removal by Calcite. Fluoride can be removed from wastewater by addition of calcite. However, ﬂuoride is often found in complex mixtures where other contaminants can affect the removal process. Batch experiments were used to determine the impact of phosphate (PO 4 3) on the removal of ﬂuoride from solution by
