## An econometric model of the iron ore industry - Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a model of the world iron ore industry that uses game theory principles to determine iron ore prices. The boundaries of the range of price negotiations are specified through bilateral oligopolistic theory and are further constrained so that the negotiating parties are not put out of business. The validation of the model indicates that it is suitable for policy analysis as well.

The iron industry is the raw-material basis of ferrous metallurgy. Iron ore has been extracted and iron produced from it since ancient times. Iron industry as a sector of the economy began to develop rapidly in the first half of the 18th century in connection with the increased smelting of pig iron and steel.
