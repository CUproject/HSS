Working Principle of Vibratory Conveyors. The vibrating conveyors throw product particles in the air - horizontally and vertically and catch them on the pan. This is a continuous cycle. The material is moved ahead quickly on this equipment when this cycle of throwing product particles in the air is repeated.
