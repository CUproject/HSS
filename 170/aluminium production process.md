## Aluminium Production Process: Challenges and Opportunities - MDPI
Aluminium, with more than 50 Mt annual production in 2016, is an essential material in modern engineering designs of lightweight structures. To obtain aluminium ingots from bauxite, three main processes are involved: the Bayer process to produce alumina from bauxite; the anode manufacturing process to produce electrodes, and the smelting process using the Hall-Héroult technology.

The starting material for electrolytic smelting of aluminum is pure, anhydrous alumi-num oxide (Al 2 O 3) called alumina. In the Western World, the Bayer 1 process, invented in the 19th century, is by far the most important process used in the production of alumi-num oxide from bauxite. The process has been refined and improved since its inception.

## Aluminum Composite Panel Production Process
The process of producing acp panel is to clean the aluminum coil first. In the production of aluminum coils, due to the needs of the process, the surface is coated with lubricants and anti-oxidants, and some dirt will be attached during transportation, which will affect its adhesion and must be cleaned. cleaning and chemical treatment
