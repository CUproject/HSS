## The Metallurgy of Gold | Semantic Scholar
AbstractThe discovery of gold about 7000 years ago together with that of its sister metals from group IB of the periodic table can be said to have laid the early foundations of metallurgy as a science and a technology. The attraction of the metal to man derives from its relative scarcity and high value, its excellent corrosion resistance, its unique yellow colour and the fact that it is one of

The metallurgy of gold is discussed with reference to its physical and mechanical properties, its fabrication and alloying behaviour and electrodeposition processes. The malleability of gold allows it to be hammered to extreme thinness and the production of gold leaf is described.

## parting | metallurgy | Britannica
parting, in metallurgy, the separation of gold and silver by chemical or electrochemical means. Gold and silver are often extracted together from the same ores or recovered as by-products from the extraction of other metals. A solid mixture of the two, known as bullion, or doré, can be parted by boiling in nitric acid. The silver is dissolved as silver nitrate, leaving a residue of gold that

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.
