The colored gemstone business is completely different.

## Color-Coding as a Preventive Control in Food Processing
Keep the color-coding plan simple. Plans work best with 3-5 colors in most small-to-medium plants. Secondary methods of color-coding, such as using a broom that's one color with a different colored handle, usually confuse workers and aren't nearly as effective as a total-color system. Be consistent with colors.
