Coal Production. Since the early 1990's Indonesian coal mining in Indonesia has grown dramatically. The World Coal Institute estimates that in 2008 Indonesia mined 246 million tonnes of coal with just over 200 millions tonnes of this exported. 2008 coal exports comprised 173 million tonnes of steam coal and 30 million tonnes of coking coal. In 2009, Indonesia was the world's second largest

A major concern for investors in Indonesia's mining sector is the changeable regulatory framework. Law No. 4/2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining and its implementing Government Regulations bring a host of new rules, some of which have been heavily resented in the industry. The divestment rule is of particular interest to foreign investors.

## Mining Indonesia | Introduction and Overview
Mining in Indonesia includes a part or all stages of coal and mineral exploration and exploitation. Minerals are defined by law number 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining ("Mining Law") as inorganic compounds which possess specific characteristics and compositions in the form of ores. Coal is defined as sediment of organic carbon which is naturally formed from plants.

## Indonesia - The State of Global Coal
Indonesia. Coal is currently a major part of the Indonesian economy with coal mining contributing to about 5% of the country's GDP and 12% of all export income. However, the Indonesian coal economy is changing. Indonesian coal exports are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand from China, India, and global market conditions.
