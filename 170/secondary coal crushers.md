## How to Choose a Right Rock Crusher? - HongXing Machinery
For relatively soft materials with a compressive strength lower than 200Mpa, such as gypsum and bituminous coal, a rock hammer crusher is appropriate. It makes the material in one shot without the secondary crushing and shaping process, which can reduce the cost by about 40% with low energy consumption and low investment.
