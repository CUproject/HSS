## Mining industry and sustainable development: time for change
Mining industries provide many of the raw materials for equipment we use daily, from aluminum cans up to electronic chips of cell phones and computers. To arrive here, metal mining steadily increased over the centuries, with occasional "rushes" for several minerals (silver, gold, radium, etc.) which occurred in connection with booms in demand.

## Mining Industry - Introduction to Mining Financial Concepts
Feb 27, 2022The mining industry is involved in the extraction of precious minerals and other geological materials. The extracted materials are transformed into a mineralized form that serves an economic benefit to the prospector or miner. Typical activities in the mining industry include metals production, metals investing, and metals trading.
