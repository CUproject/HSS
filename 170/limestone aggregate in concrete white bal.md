## Limestone aggregate concrete, usefulness and durability
The use of limestone powder as an alternative concrete admixture can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by approximately 15%, saving about 10% of cement raw materials [5, 6]. Addition of limestone powder in cement-based materials has a number of effects, including accelerated hydration [7], activation effect [8] and changes in particle

## The use of limestone aggregate in concrete
Concrete structure is made up of cement, aggregate and water. In building construction the aggregates commonly used are limestone and granite. Three quarters of concrete is made up from aggregate, thus the selection of aggregate should be in the prime condition. To produce a good, strength and high quality concrete the materials used should be in accordance to standard specification. JKR

Limestone. Limestone is available in a number of different sizes and styles to suit your individual needs and tastes. Some homeowners prefer the traditional, subtle look of washed clean stone. It's carefully pulverized and screened to size. The typical size used for a driveway is 3/4″, although 3/8″ or 1 1/2″ may also be used.

## The effects of limestone aggregate on concrete properties
The ratio of limestone as aggregate in the concrete in 1974 was only 1.3%. Since then, the shipments and the usage of limestone have increased every year with the demand of concrete and the shortage of other natural aggregates as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ratio of limestone as aggregate exceeded 8% in 2003. Download : Download full-size image
