The Modern Steel Production Process . Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century. Modern methods, however, are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process, which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.

Applications in deep drawing, chain, pipe, wire and making nails. Medium carbon steel (carbon % in between 0.25 and 0.55):

Step 2: Annealing. During the drawing process, we apply tremendous pressure on metal rod to form a thinner wire. Thus, the wire we get is extremely brittle and can easily be fractured if flexed. The finished wire must be flexible, so in this step we're going to soften, or to anneal the wire. Annealing is accomplished by heating the wire to

Modern methods, however, are still based the same premise as the Bessemer Process, namely, how to most efficiently use oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron. Modern steelmaking can be broken down into six steps: 1. Ironmaking: In the first step, the raw inputs iron ore, coke, and lime are melted in a blast furnace. The resulting molten iron - also referred to as 'hot metal' - still
