## Why Is Coal So Important - Realonomics
The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam which drives a turbine which produces electricity. Why is coal so important to the economy? Coal is America's most abundant energy resource—making up 90 percent of U.S. fossil energy reserves on a Btu basis. .
