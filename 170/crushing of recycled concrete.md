## What Is Crushed Concrete? - Modern Design
Concrete is not biodegradable and won't decompose, so it sits there taking up space. This can eventually cause environmental problems. A better alternative is to recycle the concrete by breaking it up into chunks and crushing it. The new crushed concrete can be used in all sorts of applications including to make new concrete.
