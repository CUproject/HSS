## India's Mining Industry: Manganese Mining Procedures & Importance
Yes, you heard that right. Manganese is an important metallic element that has been in use since prehistoric times. Previously it found application as a coloring material, as an alloy for hardening iron and bronze, and as an oxidizer. Currently, according to the mining industry in India, the steed sector accounts for 90% of Manganese consumption.
