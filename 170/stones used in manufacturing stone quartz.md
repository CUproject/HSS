## Types of Stones | Their Structure, Composition, and Properties.
The use of limestones as facing stones should be avoided in areas where the air is polluted with industrial gases and also in coastal regions where Saltish winds can attack them. In both cases, air is likely to strike the rock chemically and change its surface to spots of reactive compounds. Limestones are widely used in the making of cement.
