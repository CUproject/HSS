## crushed stone or crusher run shed base -- Vetura
Jan 16, 2021Gravel Foundation Recommended for the Storage Sheds. We recommend a 4 to 6 gravel base of either #57 stone or clean crusher run. Remove topsoil and replace with gravel flush with surrounding terrain. if there is a slope to deal with, remove enough soil from the high area to lower the elevation of the shed.

## Crushed Stone: The Unsung Mineral Hero - Geology
Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.
