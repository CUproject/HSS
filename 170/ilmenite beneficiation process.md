A new crude ilmenite beneficiation process was recently proposed that allowed for the preparation of a smelter grade ilmenite from ilmenite with elevated chromium content. Magnetising roasting was not utilised in the process. As part of this circuit an ilmenite low susceptible reject stream was produced that had a low magnetic susceptibility.
