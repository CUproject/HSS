## Limestone - Arkansas
The principal mineral of limestone is calcite (CaCO3), a form of calcium carbonate. Limestone is composed of material derived by both chemical and biological activities. Often, little distinction is made between limestone and dolostone because they are often interchangeable in their uses. Both are frequently sold under the name of limestone.

Limestone with more than 10 per cent of magnesium is called dolomite. When the percentage rises to 45, it is true dolomite.  Corrupt practices have led to mismanagement of mineral resources making mining industry highly inefficient. Recycling of cyclic minerals [iron, aluminium, copper, brass, tin] can help in reducing the waste.

How To Mine Limestone? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Two mines along the Ohio River in north-central Kentucky (Outer Bluegrass Region) are producing stone from the Camp Nelson Limestone for the manufacture of low-magnesium and high-calcium limes. The limes are used for flue-gas desulfurization at coal-fired power plants, and for steel-furnace flux, chemical manufacture, and water treatment.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.
