## Top 3 Chrome Ore Processing Methods that Get Higher Recovery Rate
Jul 22, 2022Shaking tables are more popular due to high separating accuracy. Among the chrome beneficiation machines, jigs are for chromite rocks with medium and fine grain sizes, and shaking tables are for fine chromite ore. The combination of jigs and shaking tables is more prevalent in the chromite gravity separation plants for the best recovery effect.

## Chrome Ore Process Plant - JXSC Mineral
The mainly process of chrome ore processing is gravity separation.Sometimes low intensity magnetic separation or high-intensity magnetic separation will be used to deal with the chrome concentrate for a second processing to improve the grade of the chrome. Also some ores treated by flotation, but the gravity separation is still the main processing way for chrome ores.
