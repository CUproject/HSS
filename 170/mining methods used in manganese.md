## Manganese Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC
The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.
