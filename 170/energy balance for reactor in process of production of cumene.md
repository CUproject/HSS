## Monsanto/Lummus Crest process produces lowest cost Cumene
Abstract. Cumene is manufactured by the alkylation of benzene with propylene and is used almost exclusively as a feedstock for phenol production via the cumene oxidation route. Monsanto's interest in cumene process development dates back to the 60's and 70's when it was a major U.S. producer of both cumene and phenol.

The cumene process method is quite expensive, since it requires the raw materials and extra separation equip-ment to separate acetone from many different materials (Moore & Parker, 2007; Coulson et al., 1999b). Therefore, this study focuses on the more economic method of decomposition of isopropyl alcohol over the cumene process method.

## Cumene Benzene Alkylation | ExxonMobil Product Solutions
Alkylation. An alkylation reactor uses ExxonMobil catalyst to convert benzene and propylene to cumene in the liquid phase. A small fraction of the cumene is further alkylated to polyisopropylbenzenes (PIPB), which is recovered in distillation and converted back to cumene in the transalkylation reactor.

The chemistry of the cumene process features the desired reaction of benzene with propylene to form cumene and the undesirable reaction of cumene with propylene to formp-diisopropylbenzene. Both reactions are irreversible. Since the second has a higher activation energy than the first, low reactor temperatures improve selectivity of cumene.

## Material and energy balance of Cumene production process (CHEMICAL 
Question Description The calculation should cover overall mass and energy balance (mass flow rates, enthalpies, and temperatures) of allstreams. Hand calculations must be used in details. For mass and energy balance around the reactors, use theextent of reaction and the heat of formation methods ONLY. Requirements: 1- Mass & Energy balance for all streams (conditions .

## Material & Energy Balance for Batch Reactor - ChemEnggHelp
The material balance for per batch will be as below. Charge of RM - A, 2000 kgs/batch. Charge of RM - B, 2500 kgs/batch (since B is charged 1.25 times of A) Total mass of in reactor (RM - A + RM - B = 4500 kgs/batch) Equilibrium conversion is 85% hence unreacted RM - A in crude product = 2000 (100 - 85)/100 = 300 kg.

## Technology Profile: Cumene Production from Benzene
The present analysis discusses an industrial process for cumene production. The process has two main sections: (1) reaction; and (2) distillation. Reaction. In the reaction section, there are two reactors: the alkylation reactor and the transalkylation reactor.
