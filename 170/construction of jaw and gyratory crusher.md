##  Construction Working and Maintenance of Crushers for Crushing Bulk 
Gyratory Crushers Gyratory crusher is generally used as a primary crusher. The crusher is popular due to its high throughput capacity and the large sized opening. The crusher is well suited for handling direct feed from haul/dump trucks. The gyratory crusher is mainly used in rock that is abrasive and/or has high compressive strength.
