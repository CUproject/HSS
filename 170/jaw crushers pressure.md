##  Jaw Crushers
Jaw Crushers MJ 90, MJ 110 and MJ 130 Technical Specification Jaw Crushers reduce large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. There are also primary and secondary types of jaw crushers.

## What are the Materials of the Jaw Crusher Plates and Which is Better 
High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance. However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Jaw crusher: The material is crushed between a fixed jaw and a mobile jaw. The feed is subjected to repeated pressure as it passes downwards and is progressively reduced in size until it is small enough to pass out of the crushing chamber. This crusher produces less fines but the aggregates have a more elongated form.

As excessive wear can cause a 10-20% reduction in production, it is important to find the optimal time for the jaw turn or change in terms of cost and benefit. Again, with the same scenario with C130, we would have approximately a 70 stph reduction in production, in other words, a decrease of USD 4000 to 8000 in revenue for one day.

## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A jaw crusher consists essentially of two crushing plates, inclined to each other forming a horizontal opening by their lower borders. Material is crushed between a fixed and a movable plate by reciprocating pressure until the crushed product becomes small enough to pass through the gap between the crushing plates.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
