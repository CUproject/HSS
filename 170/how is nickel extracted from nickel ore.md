## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low-grade ores and bleed streams
All nickel ores have relatively low nickel content, the classification is as follows: high-grade nickel ore has Ni content greater than 1.8%, middle-grade nickel ore has Ni content between 1.3-1.7%, low-grade nickel ore has Ni content between 0.6-1.2%.  Another method for extraction of nickel from the bleed stream is the use of solvent

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Nickel laterites are a very important type of nickel ore deposit. They are growing to become the most important source of nickel metal for world demand (currently second to sulfide nickel ore deposits ). Nickel laterites are generally mined via open cut mining methods. Nickel is extracted from the ore by a variety of process routes.

1. Differential flotation or partial differential flotation process. When the content of copper is much more than nickel in the ore, this process can be used to separate the copper as the single concentrate. The advantage of this process is that the copper concentrate with lower nickel content can be obtained directly. 2. Bulk flotation process.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
