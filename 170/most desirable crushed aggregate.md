## Crushed Stone Vs. Gravel - A.L. BLAIR CONSTRUCTION
Feb 24, 2022Road and patio base layers can benefit from using both crushed stone and gravel. Road base layers, such as what you'd find on a gravel road or driveway, often use a top layer of ¾-inch aggregates. Sub-base layers, immediately below the road, driveway, or patio top layer, are usually 1 ½ to 3 inches. Both the base and sub-base layers can be

## 7 Lab Tests on Aggregate to Check Quality for Use in Road Work
The crushed aggregate is allowed to pass through 2.36 mm IS sieve. And the impact value is measured as percentage of aggregates passing sieve (W2) to the total weight of the sample (W1). Aggregate impact value = (W1/W2)100. Aggregates to be used for wearing course, the impact value shouldn't exceed 30 percent.
