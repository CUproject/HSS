## Open Troughed Belt Conveyors - Beumer Conveying Technology
Troughed belt conveyors for high mass flow. Belt conveyors come in many shapes and forms, open troughed belt conveyors are used to transport materials such as bulk materials for cement production quickly over long distances and through rough terrain, e.g., from the quarry to the cement plant. The trough shape allows for the safer transportation

## Design of Steep Angle Conveyor
Therefore conveyor / equipment design will have to go by the recommendation of belt manufacturer in this matter (i.e. wheel dia, pulley dia, etc.), because only belt designer / belt manufacturer has belt research and test data. Regarding resistance / power calculation for such conveyor, the calculation procedure is primarily like belt conveyor.
