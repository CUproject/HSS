## Underground Leak Detection
The combination of the air escaping with the water will produce a detectable ultrasound. To be sure the leak has been found when using an ultrasound instrument, mark the suspected leak point and then move the instrument away from the point, touching at small intervals (about 12" - 30.5 cm) and listening.

## Use of Infrared to Detect Underground and Concrete Water Leaks
Use of infrared can be used to detect leaks in pipes laid as far as 98.43 feet below the ground surface. Factors to consider when deciding on the infrared camera to use in underground and concrete water leaks. Underground and concrete water leaks can be a nightmare when they are not detected on time and repaired.

## Life
Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from that which does not, and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria.

## Ground Penetrating Radar at the Underground Detective
Ground Penetrating Radar, also known as GPR, is a means of generating a profile of subsurface structures non-destructively. Ground penetrating radar is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. This non-destructive method uses electromagnetic radiation waves and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.
