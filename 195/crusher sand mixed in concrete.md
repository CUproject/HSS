3. Concrete Sand. Concrete sand consists of granite rock, gneiss, or limestone. This sand has angular granules and works best when mixed with cement. Besides usage in concrete, concrete sand can also be used in bedding pipes. This type of sand is usually crushed in a quarry and filtered severally to remove huge fragments and large rocks.
