In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

## How is bituminous coal mined?aroni
Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining.  If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining. In surface mining, workers simply remove any overlying sediment, vegetation, and rock, called overburden. Where is sub bituminous coal mined?

## Coal mining
When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut (also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which

Highly mechanized mining processes are widely used in surface mining because they generally provide an efficient approach for achieving high production (Shrestha and Lal, 2011).However, high production is also associated with large volumes of waste production (Ramani, 2012).During surface mining, the excavated materials from depths of 0-200 m are stripped off and they vary

## Late 20th Century Coal Mining | Energy History - Yale University
The U.S. coal economy underwent significant changes during the late twentieth century in terms of where and how coal was produced. Overall production increased after 1960 in eastern coal mines, with another jump occurring in western mines after 1970. Mining techniques also shifted from underground to surface mining.

Surface mining existed as well, but it wasn't until the big shovels came on in the 1940s and 1950s that strip mining began to take a larger portion of the state's annual coal production. Generally it is economic to strip mine when there is a 20:1 ratio of overburden-to-coal seam, meaning, for example that a three-foot coal seam can be

Surface mining is used when the coal seam is near the surface. It recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited - 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Surface Coal Mining. Surface mining is accomplished by removing overburden from the coal seam and then blasting and removing the coal. The ratio of overburden excavated to the amount of coal removed is called the overburden ratio. The lower the ratio, the more productive the mine. The lowest overburden ratios are found in western surface mines.
