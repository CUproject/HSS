## Coal gasification
Coal gasification is the process of producing syngas—a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and water vapour (H 2 O)—from coal and water, air and/or oxygen.. Historically, coal was gasified to produce coal gas, also known as "town gas".Coal gas is combustible and was used for heating and municipal lighting, before the

## Integration of membrane technology for decarbonization of gasification 
The application of membrane system in gasification-based power plants is particularly appealing considering the elevated pressure of syngas subject to decarbonization resulting in lower energy and economic penalties for CO2 capture.

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) takes advantage of the same chemical reactions of coal to produce product gases, as those occurring in conventional gasifier reactors. The main difference is that in UCG the underground coal seam itself becomes the reactor, so that the gasification of the coal takes place underground instead of in a manufactured gasification vessel at the surface.1 Obviously

The government aims to achieve 100 million tonnes of coal gasification in the next eight years in order to reduce the import of crude oil which is otherwise used to produce syngas.

The whole point in gas works or in underground coal gasification is that you partially combust the material so that actually, most of the energy is still in the gas when you bring it to the surface. That's the whole point because then you're saying, "This gas is a source of energy. I haven't actually used up very much of the energy in this

Underground coal gasification (or in-situ coal gasification) is a controversial mining process where coal is burned under the ground to create gas. Fuels are injected into the ground to ignite the coal to a temperature of degrees celsius in order to produce gas. The gas is then extracted out through vertical wells or in-seam boreholes.

Mar 28, 20221. Introduction. Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a coal utilization method that permits coal resources to be exploited in situ using high-temperature conversion reactions (Perkins 2018a).The process makes it possible to utilize more coal resources as environmentally sustainable gas and liquid fuels instead of solid fuel (Lavis, Courtney, and Mostade 2013; Mostade 2014).
