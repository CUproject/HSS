## Uranium Mining Overview - World Nuclear Association
Mill chemistry. The crushed and ground ore, or the underground ore in the case of ISL mining, is leached with sulfuric acid: UO 3 + 2H + ====> UO 2 2+ + H 2 O UO 2 2+ + 3SO 4 2-====> UO 2 (SO 4) 3 4-. The UO 2 is oxidised to UO 3.. With some ores, carbonate leaching is used to form a soluble uranyl tricarbonate ion: UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4-.This can then be precipitated with an alkali, e.g. as sodium

## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
Mar 25, 2021Mining is one of the most vital components of modern society due to the use of mined minerals in almost every consumer product. Additionally, 50% of the nation's energy comes from coal or nuclear power that uses uranium. To support this need for modern equipment, mines are found in all 50 states, including our home state of Nevada.

The ore body can be efficiently mined in large volumes and with higher productivity using larger underground equipment and the bulk mining methods. There are several methods for bulk underground mining, the most common being block caving, long hole open stoping, sublevel open stoping, sublevel caving and vertical-crater-retreat.

## Uranium mining - Energy Education
Depending on the deposit, uranium is mined in one of three ways: open pit, underground, or in situ recovery. Open pit. When uranium is found near the surface - usually no more than 100 meters deep - it can be extracted via open pit mining. In this method, soil and waste rock is removed by heavy equipment, allowing the ore to be accessed.

## Uranium
Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years.

Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.
