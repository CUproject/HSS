## Millstone
Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills, for grinding wheat or other grains. They are sometimes referred to as grindstones or grinding stones.. Millstones come in pairs: a convex stationary base known as the bedstone and a concave runner stone that rotates. The movement of the runner on top of the bedstone creates a "scissoring" action that grinds grain trapped between the stones.

## Anyone have a home stone mill? | The Fresh Loaf
Electric Mills. The most affordable electric mills for the home user are the micronizer mills, such as the Nutrimill. The major downside of these mills is that they cannot mill grits or coarse flour - the flour fineness is only slightly variable. However, for most whole grain breads, the baker will want a fine flour, not a coarse one.
