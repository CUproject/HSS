## Lime in Soil Stabilization | Global Road Technology - GRT
Lime in soil stabilization or any calcium-based additives when in contact with soluble sulphate salt may cause soil distress and heaving, resulting in strength loss. The source of sulphate is either soil minerals, water used for mixing or groundwater. Some other noticed adverse effects are increased soil compressibility and reduced shear strength.
