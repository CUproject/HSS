## Introduction to Rock Crushers
Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.

First the rock will enter the crushing chamber and drop as far as the angle of the crushing surface will allow it to. The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle and the liner as it opens. The coarse material that can't fall through will remain to be crushed with the next gyration.
