## Coal fired power plant - Energy Education
Coal fired power plants also known as coal fired power stations are facilities that burn coal to make steam in order to generate electricity. These stations, seen in Figure 1, provide ~40% of the world's electricity. [2] Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70-75% of their

The operator is the state-owned Taiwan Power Company, which owns four other coal-fired power plants in addition to the Taichung power plant. The power plant consists of 10 coal-fired power units, supplemented by 4 small gas turbine power units of 70 MW each. The first four power units with a capacity of 550 MW each were built in 1991 and 1992.
