## limestone magnetic separation
What is the use of limestone of in the extraction of iron  Answer: Usually, limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) is "calcined" in a lime kiln, where it is heated to form lime (CaO) and CO2 gas. The lime is then used in both steelmaking furnaces to refine liquid iron into steel, and also on ladles as slag to further refine the steel.

## Carbon sequestration
Carbon sequestration is the process of storing carbon in a carbon pool.: 2248 Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, and physical processes. These changes can be accelerated through changes in land use and agricultural practices, such as converting crop land into land for non-crop fast growing plants.

Static force is simply the deadweight of the machine, applying downward force on the soil surface, compressing the soil particles. The only way to change the effective compaction force is by adding or subtracting the weight of the machine. Static compaction is confined to upper soil layers and is limited to any appreciable depth.

## Industrial minerals: Separation technology for the highest demands 
Hi-gradient magnet and sensor sorting technology for absolutely pure products. 600 t/h and more is what our 3 metre wide STEINERT KSS combined optical sorting machine can process. Here, limestone of sizes up to 200 mm are analysed and sorted by white level. Only the purest white material passes the valve strip without being diverted.
