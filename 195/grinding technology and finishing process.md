May 29, 2022Grinding Wheel. In the grinding process, an emery or corundum wheel is used as the cutting tool. Emery and corundum are naturally found abrasives and are impure forms of aluminium oxide Al 2 O 3.A grinding wheel is made up of thousands of tiny abrasive particles embedded in a matrix called the 'bond' An abrasive is an extremely hard material second in hardness only to diamond.
