## The Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index
For more than 46 years, chemical process industries (CPI) professionals — engineers, managers, and technicians — have used Chemical Engineering's Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) to adjust process plant construction costs from one period to another. This index — rather, indexes, as it consists of a composite index and eleven sub-indexes

Germanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard-brittle, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors silicon and tin.Pure germanium is an indirect semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.
