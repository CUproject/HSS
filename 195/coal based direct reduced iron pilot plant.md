## Process Description and flow diagram of Coal Based DRI Plant
Coal plays a dual role in the Kiln. Part of coal is used as fuel to supply the desired heat so as to take the raw materials to the desired temp. But main role of coal is to supply carbon in the reduction process. Dolomite is used as sulphur scavenger which finally comes out with the char. Char contains ash of coal and other impurities of iron ore.

The Bureau of Mines conducted a study of the cost of installing and operating both a natural gas- and a coal-based direct-reduction plant on the Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota. The accuracy of the capital and operating costs are +/-25 and +/-15 percent, respectively. Product from the plants would be direct-reduced iron (dri) pellets containing approximately 84 percent metallic iron.

Oct 6, 2020The rate of decarbonisation would depend on how rapidly this modern technology could replace today's dominant blast furnace steel mills, which meet about 70% of global demand. Blast furnaces require coking coal for the reduction of iron ore as well as alloying of carbon to create the steel itself. In contrast, DRI can currently use methane.

## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting
