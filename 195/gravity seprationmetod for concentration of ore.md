An interesting aspect of the magnetic separation of ore S (and partially ore I) is the enrichment of Mn in the magnetic concentrate. The amount of Mn was increased about 4 times from 0.4% and 0.2% in ores S and I, respectively, to 1.6% and 0.8% in the magnetic concentrates. The amount of Mn in the corresponding tails is more or less zero.

Concentration of ore can be done by 4 methods: Hydraulic Washing, Magnetic Separation, Froth Floatation, Leaching. Hydraulic washing depends upon the weights of the metal and gangue particles.

By flowing the powdered ore in a current of water, the lighter rocky impurities can be washed away and the ore particles are left behind. For this, either wilfley table or Hydraulic classifier is used. Generally oxide and carbonate ores are concentrated by this method. i.e. haematite and cerussite. There are two gravity concentration methods.

## Gravity separation process is used for the concentration of ______. A 
The gravity separation technique is used to concentrate ore, as we all know. The gravity separation method is based on the gravity differences between the ore and the gangue particles in the ore. Metal ores are, on average, heavier than gangue particles. This feature is used in the gravity separation process to concentrate ore.

The ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand, clay, lime stone, etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores. The choice of method depends on the nature of the ore.
