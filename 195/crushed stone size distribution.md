Udden-Wentworth Scale. According to the Udden-Wentworth scale, gravel can be divided into pebbles ranging in size from 4 mm to 64 mm (0.2 to 2.5 inches) or granules with particles ranging from 2 mm to 4 mm (0.079 to 0.157 inches). Subcategories of granular gravel are fine and very fine.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
For example, depending on the region of the United States, crushed stone in the size of a few mm to 2 inches is referred to as "gravel," even if it has been crushed and is no longer smooth. To provide clarity and avoid confusion, we will stay with the definition that gravel cannot refer to crushed stone and must remain in a natural state.

Sep 6, 2022A Family Business Since 1935 The story of Mulzer Crushed Stone is very much the story of success. It started in 1935 when Roland, Edgar and Arnold Mulzer, Sr. began building culverts for highway construction. In 1946, the Mulzer brothers saw the need for a close supply of construction aggregates during the post World War II construction boom.

What are the different sizes of gravel ? Gravel is classified by particle size range and includes size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments. In the Udden-Wentworth scale gravel is categorized into granular gravel (2 to 4 mm or 0.079 to 0.157 in) and pebble gravel (4 to 64 mm or 0.2 to 2.5 in).. Crushed stone #57 which includes Â¾
