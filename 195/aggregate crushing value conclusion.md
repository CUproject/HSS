Conclusion From the experiment, we get 6.02% where it still not exceeding JKR's standard, <30%. So we can conclude that the aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate are mild tough to have the resistance pressure under traffic wheel loads such as car, lorry, motorcycle and etc.
