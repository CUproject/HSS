## What is the purpose of a water treatment plant?
The purpose of a water treatment plant in simple terms is to purify wastewater to a safe level. Wastewater that has been run through a water treatment plant can be safely released into the environment. When this treated water mixes in with the water in rivers and canals, it doesn't decrease the water quality.
