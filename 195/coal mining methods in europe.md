## Mining Methods - Indian Infrastructure
Surface mining is used when deposits of the mineral or ore are found near the surface, where the overburden (gravel and sand) is relatively thin. It is a broad category as it includes different types of mining methods such as strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal and dredging. It has become the predominant method for the Indian

Deep underground mining is needed when coal seams are found too deep underground. The main underground mining methods are Longwall, Continuous, Blast, Shortwall mining and Retreat mining. Longwall mining covers for about 50% of underground production. It uses a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth

Coal mining projections. By 2040, the percentage of coal in the power mix will decrease by about 10 percentage points from 38 to 28 percent. But at the same time world demand for energy will grow massively so MUCH more is needed to seriously reduce the damaging effects of coal mining - and turning the coal into energy.

When is this method used? Longwall mining is used to mine a long wall of coal in a single slice. How does it work?

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits.As well as drift mines, small scale shaft mining was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with

2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

## Environment Energy Mining Watch SEE - Coal Mines in Europe
Aug 8, 2021Although doomed to disappear due to the catastrophic impact on the environment, coal mines remain a reality in many European countries. However, coal accounts for only 15% of European Union's energy production. In the 27 Member States, 53,000 persons are working in thermal power plants and in mines - 185.000, according to the European
