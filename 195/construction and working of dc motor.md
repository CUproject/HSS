Working of DC Motor. Being in the magnetic field of the magnet, each current carrying conductor (A and B) of the armature coil experiences a force which ultimately results into rotation ofthe armature coil. To understand how unidirectional torque is produced in a dc motor, consider the armature coil in its different positions as shown in Fig. 2.

Working principle and construction of a DC Motor. The working principle of a DC motor is based on the fact that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the conductor experiences a mechanical force. The direction and magnitude of this force is given by Fleming's left-hand rule, F-> = B->I->L.

## DC Motor Working Principle, Construction and Diagram Explanation
The DC motor working principle is that a current-carrying conductor experiences a mechanical force when placed in a magnetic field. This is known as the Lorentz force. And the direction of this force is given by FLEMING'S LEFT-HAND RULE. DC motor working principle is similar to the working principle of a DC generator.

## Introduction to DC Motors, Construction, Working, Parts, Features 
Jan 29, 2021In this post, we will discuss the DC motor construction working types and different parts. So let's get started with Introduction to Induction Motors. Introduction to DC Motors. In previous years the power system was used dc power system but in the 1890s the use of ac power system becomes very common to the people.

## Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) Motor - Construction, Working and 
In Permanent Magnet DC Motor or PMDC Motor, permanent magnet is used to create the working flux in the air gap instead of field winding. The construction of rotor is same as that of the Conventional DC Motor i.e. rotor of PMDC Motor consists of armature core, armature winding and commutator. Generally, there are two types of winding in a Conventional DC Motor, namely Filed Winding and Armature

## What is Brushed DC Motor? With the Inner Workings | Robu
Brushed DC motors are one of the simplest types of DC motor. It uses brushes to deliver current to the motor windings through mechanical commutation. The number of coils wound around the motor and the density of the coils determine the properties of the motor. The armature or rotor is an electromagnet. The field magnet is a permanent magnet.
