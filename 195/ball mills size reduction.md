## LAB REPORT SIZE REDUCTION.docx - Course Hero
Abstract Size reduction is the operation carried out for reducing the size of the bigger particle into a smaller one by external forces. This reduction in size is done by using ball mill. In the experiment, the stone weighs about 300g and mix with two handhelds of grinding ball into the ball mill. The speed control knob is adjusted each at 40 rpm and 80rpm.

In this study, we investigate the effect of the ball size in a high-energy ball mill on the comminution rate and particle size reduction. High-energy ball milling at 2000 rpm produces ultrafine talc particles with a surface area of 419.1 m 2 /g and an estimated spherical diameter of 5.1 nm.

The Ball/Rod mills are meant for producing fine particle size reduction through attrition and compressive forces at the grain size level. They are the most effective laboratory mills for batch-wise, rapid grinding of medium-hard to very hard samples down to finest particle sizes.

The size reduction occurs by impact as the balls drop and impact the surface of the particles. The ball mill can go down to approx. 10 micrometres in size although it should be noted that this ball mill methodology is most effective with relatively small sample sizes.  The ball mill is used for size reduction process on materials such as

## Ball Or Tumbling Mill Suitable For Size Reduction Operation
Ball mill or pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine used for size reduction of the particles. Ball mill manufacturers intend each model with a hollow cylinder which constitutes balls; mounted over a metallic frame so that it can be turned along its longitudinal axis. The balls with different diameter occupy 30-50% of the mill volume.

## Three Common Problems and Solutions In Ball Milling Processing
Therefore, in ball milling processing, the operator of ball mill should monitor the feeding size closely. If the particle size is over the designed limit, feeding should be stopped or reduced, and take relative measures to guarantee the feeding particle sizes. (2)Unsatisfied steel ball filling amount.
