## Barite | Egymines
Barite is a kind of mineral composed of barium sulfate, BaSO4. Barite is usually colorless or milky white, but can be almost any color, depending on the impurities trapped in the crystals during their formation. Barite is relatively soft, measuring 3-3.5 on Mohs' scale of hardness. It is unusually heavy for a non-metal
