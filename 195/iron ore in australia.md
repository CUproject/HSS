## The Iron Ore, Coal and Gas Sectors | Bulletin - March Quarter 2011
Most of Australia's iron ore production is exported, predominantly to Asia. After rapid growth in the past decade, the main export market for Australia's iron ore is now China (almost 70 per cent of iron ore exports in 2010), with Japan and Korea importing most of the balance (Graph 2).
