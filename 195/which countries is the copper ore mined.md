Mining copper ore is arguably easier for Alliance players-Elwynn Forest, Westfall, and all of the dwarven countries are rich with copper ore nodes. Loch Modan, Dun Morogh, and to a lesser extent, Elwynn Forest, are the best locations to farm copper ore for Alliance WoW players, however.

Relation to Mining. The amount of copper believed to be accessible for mining is 1.6 billion tons. In addition, it is estimated that 700 million tons of copper is available in deep-sea nodules. Mineral-rich nodules of magnesium, copper and other metals are known to form as a product of deep-sea volcanic activity.

## The Largest Copper Mines in the World by Capacity - Elements by Visual 
Oct 12, 2021Mines with equal capacities have the same rankings. †2020. The Escondida Mine in Chile is by far the world's largest copper mine. Its annual capacity of 1.4 million tonnes means that it can produce more copper than the second and third-largest mines combined.. Porphyry copper deposits are often characterized by lower grade ores and are mined in open pits.
