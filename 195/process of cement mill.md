## Coal Mill - Coal Mill In Cement Plant | AGICO Cement Equipment
The coal mill grinding system is an important part of the dry process cement manufacturing. In cement plants, we usually adopt the air swept coal mill system or vertical mill system as the pulverized coal preparation system, which is arranged at the cement kiln head or kiln tail to provide fuel for clinker calcination. However, due to the flammable and explosive characteristics of pulverized

## Manufacturing Process Of Cement - Construction How
The process of manufacturing cement can either be a wet process or a dry process. The basic difference between the two processes is in the method the raw materials are ground and mixed. In the dry process, the raw materials are crushed first and dry mixed.  A wash mill. The raw materials are crushed and fed into a wash mill.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Cement manufacturing - brief description of a cement mill. Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill. This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media - normally steel balls.  However, reading an article or two is perhaps not the best way to get a clear picture of a complex process like cement production.
