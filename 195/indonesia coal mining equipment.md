## Indonesia and coal - Global Energy Monitor
Coal Production. Since the early 1990's Indonesian coal mining in Indonesia has grown dramatically. The World Coal Institute estimates that in 2008 Indonesia mined 246 million tonnes of coal with just over 200 millions tonnes of this exported. 2008 coal exports comprised 173 million tonnes of steam coal and 30 million tonnes of coking coal.

## Case history of environmental impacts of an Indonesian coal supply 
By 2040, coal production is expected to increase from 171 to 208 billion GJ, with China and India the largest consumers ( U.S. EIA, 2016 ). Consequently, Indonesian production and distribution of coal will become increasingly important in the context of the global energy supply. The growth in coal production poses environmental challenges
