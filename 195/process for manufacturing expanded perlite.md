What You Need to Know about Expanded Perlite. Perlite is a generic term for naturally-occurring sedimentary rock that contains silicon, aluminum, potassium, sodium and other trace minerals. What sets perlite apart from other volcanic glasses is that when it is heated to its softening range, it expands from four to twenty times its original volume.

Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content, typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral, suitable "as ceramic flux to lower the sintering temperature", and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing.
