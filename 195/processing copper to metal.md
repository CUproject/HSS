copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

With the gradual decrease in the grade of copper ores being processed, copper concentrates have become more complex with higher impurity and gangue content. This trend has had a detrimental effect on smelters as they have to increase throughput to maintain copper metal production, while increasing operating costs due to processing the increased amounts of secondary products (slag, acid) and

Once a concentrate has been produced containing copper and other metals of value (such as gold and silver), the next step is to remove impurity elements.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Recover Metal from Acid Leach Processing of Arsenic Rich Copper Wastes
Arsenic, copper, and molybdenum were effectively removed from arsenic-bearing flue dust using a three-stage continuous sulfuric acid leach. Leach conditions to maximize arsenic and copper extraction while minimizing bismuth extraction were determined: 25-wt pct H2SO4, 20- to 25-wt pct solids, a leach temperature of 55° C, and a 30-min
