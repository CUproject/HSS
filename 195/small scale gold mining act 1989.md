## Mining industry of Ghana
The overall legislative framework for the mining sector in Ghana is provided by the Minerals and Mining Act of 2006 (Act 703). Under the Law, mining companies must pay royalties; companies may also pay corporate taxes at standard rates.  The regulation of artisanal gold mining is set forth in the Small-Scale Gold Mining Law, 1989 (PNDC Law

## Small-Scale Gold Mining and the State in the Philippines
In recent decades, the Philippines has witnessed a massive expansion of small-scale gold mining. While reliable output data about small-scale mining (SSM) Footnote 1 are lacking, official gold sales to the Central Bank of the Philippines by SSM operators still provide a good indication of this strong upward trend (Fig. 1), with official SSM production repeatedly surpassing that of large-scale

Sep 13, 2021The most common commodity mined via small-scale methods is gold while all other metals and non-metals are mined via large-scale means. Citing Philippine example, large-scale mining operations occupy an area of about 5 square kilometers (sqkm) covering the actual extraction site.

ASM was formally illegal in Ghana until 1989, although widely practised. The Small-Scale Gold Mining Law 1989 (PNDCL 218) legalized and attempted to regulate small-scale mining by introducing a registration and licensing process. This was then incorporated into the current Minerals and Mining Act 2006 (Parliament of the Republic of Ghana, 2006).

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
