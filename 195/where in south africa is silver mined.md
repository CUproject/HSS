In 2013, mining companies produced 562,000 times as much waste as gold, according to the South African Chamber of Mines. A decade before, that same ratio was less than half as large, at 212,000-to-1. Mining operations are generating increased waste because South Africa's gold is running out, and the remaining resource only can be found

In Mexico, the gold and silver mines were the main interest of the Spanish settlers. The mines were worked mainly by free labour, and few enslaved Africans were imported. In the 16th century African slaves had been used in Mexico as dockworkers, as sheep and cattle herdsmen, and to a limited extent in the mines.
