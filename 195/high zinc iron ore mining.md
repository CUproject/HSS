## Origin of the Ore Body — The Sterling Hill Mining Museum
Simplified - High School Level Explanation. The Sterling and Franklin deposits are fabulously rich in zinc (more than 20%) by weight, and also in iron and manganese. Both deposits are quite large: the Sterling mine in Ogdensburg produced more than 11 million tons of zinc ore, and that at Franklin twice as much.
