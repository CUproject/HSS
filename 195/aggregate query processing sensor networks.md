## The Cougar Approach to In-Network Query Processing in Sensor Networks 
CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): The widespread distribution and availability of smallscale sensors, actuators, and embedded processors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light

## Processing approximate aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks 
In-network data aggregation has been recently proposed as an effective means to reduce the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. Nodes of the network form an aggregation tree, in which parent nodes aggregate the values received from their children and propagate the result to their own parents.

to ensure that the query processing layer is tightly in-tegrated with the networking layer. Second, the notion of the cost of a query plan has changed, as the critical resource in a sensor network is power, and query opti-mization and query processing have to be adapted to take this optimization criterion into account.

## Robust and Efficient Aggregate Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
Wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many environmental monitoring applications [].In most of these applications, aggregate queries, such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE (AVG), MIN and MAX, are often used as statistics collected from sensors [12, 13, 22].However, it is known that data collected from sensors are often noisy for various reasons, such as sensing device noise, inaccuracies in
