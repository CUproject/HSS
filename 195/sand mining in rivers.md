## The Bloody World of India's Illegal Sand Mining: At least 193 killed 
Nov 23, 2020How sand mining kills rivers. Large-scale sand mining not only destabilises the banks and riverbeds but also affects the natural flow of rivers. This increases the risk of floods. A 2019 overview of sand mining in Kerala showed how illegal mining of rivers had played its part in aggravating the severe August 2018 floods.

Impacts of sand mining on rivers may be direct or indirect (Figure 1). Direct impacts are those in which the extraction of material is directly responsible for the ecosystem impact, such as due to the removal of floodplains habitat. Indirect impacts are related to ecosystem changes that are propagated through the system due to physical changes

Along the Kangsabati River in India, the consequences of sand mining are very serious. The construction of Mukutmonipur Dam (1958) on the river causes huge sediment deposition along the middle and downstream areas, these same areas are also intensely mined for sand (instream and on the flood plain).

Sand mining is the process of extracting sand from an open pit, sea beaches, rivers and ocean beds, river banks, deltas, or inland dunes. The extracted sand can be used for various types of manufacturing, such as concrete used in the construction of buildings and other structures.

## Sand mining
Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit (or sand pit) but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. Sand is often used in manufacturing, for example as an abrasive or in concrete.It is also used on icy and snowy roads usually mixed with salt, to lower the melting point temperature, on the road surface.
