## Mining on the Mokelumne River - Calaveras Heritage Council
Placer mining began on the Mokelumne River in the earliest years of the Gold Rush, and camps were soon established along the river at Lancha Palana, Winters Bar, Oregon Bar, James Bar, and Middle Bar. Credit for the discovery of gold in the Penn Mine area, however, goes to a group of Mexican miners in 1849.
