## The South African mining sector - Wits University
This is shocking, but still emphasises the potential of gold mining as an employer where, despite a collapse in output, still employs 30% of the 1994 numbers. The main explanation for the collapse of gold mining in South Africa is margin squeeze as a result of cost increases at depth.

## Minerals and Mining in South Africa | SpringerLink
Mining in South Africa has underpinned the modern economic development of the country, while it is possible that the industry has now passed its peak and is a sunset industry as the gold and platinum mines go ever-deeper to exploit new resources.  Since then, De Beers has sold a number of its mines in South Africa, although these mines

## Mine Accidents and Disasters | Department of Mineral Resources
The overall number of deaths in the South African mining industry has declined over the past decades, but the greatest impact of mining accidents is noticed amongst the family members and colleagues left behind after a mine worker lost his or her life.  Between 1984 and 2005, more than 11 000 mine workers died in South Africa. In 2003, the
