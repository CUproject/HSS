## Safety in the mining industry | SafeWork SA
The Mines Regulations require mine operators to document in the Safety Management System the arrangements for managing risks. The risk management process is framed around the key principles of: identifying hazards that may present a risk to workers and others. assessing the consequences and likelihood of those risks.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
