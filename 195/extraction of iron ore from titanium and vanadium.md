## Titanium
Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich

## Vanadium element extraction methods - smelting, leaching, roasting 
EXTRACTING AND REFINING : Generating Vanadium pentoxide from various ores. The vanadium containing titaniferous magnetite ore is mined, crushed and partially reduced with coal and then melted in a rotary furnace. This results in a slag which contains most of the titanium and a pig iron which contains most of the vanadium.

## Extraction of titanium, vanadium and iron from titanomagnetite deposits 
The ore which contains 57.5% Fe, 0.66% V and 16.6% TiO 2 was subjected to selective reduction smelting so that most of the iron reported to the metal phase and the vanadium and titanium to the slag phase. The iron had a purity of 99%.
