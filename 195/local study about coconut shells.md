The results also indicated cost reduction of 30% and 42% for concrete produced from coconut shells and palm kernel shells, respectively. Considering the strength/economy ratio, it was concluded that coconut shells were more suitable than palm kernel shells when used as substitute for conventional aggregates in concrete production.
