## Steel Making Process - Complete Overview with Flowchart
The commercial processes for making steel are : (1) Bessemer process (2) L-D process (3) Open-hearth process (4) Crucible process (5) Electric process (6) Duplex process. The Bessemer, open hearth and electric process can be subdivided into (a) acid process and (b) basic process, according to the type of lining used in the furnace.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

Process in which oxygen is blown downwards at high velocity through a watercooled lance onto the surface of the hot metal contained in a basic lined vessel. To offset the intense heat produced, coolant materials are added with the original charge. These may be iron ore, sinter, or roll scale, but usually steel scrap is the main material used.

## The Steel Manufacturing Process - How is Steel Made?
To purify the steel, the furnace then blasts in oxygen, and lime and fluorspar are added. These substances combine with the steel's impurities, turning into slag. The slag then floats to the top of the molten steel where it is removed, leaving behind the pure steel. The EAF method is the most common steel production method today.

There are two process routes for making steel today: the electric arc furnace and the basic oxygen converter. The latter requires a charge of molten iron, which is produced in blast furnaces. The raw materials for producing molten iron are iron ore, coking coal and fluxes (materials that help the chemical process) - mainly limestone.

## Steel making process - ArcelorMittal
There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

Steel is produced in an open hearth furnace by the following steps: 1. A machine dumps limestone and scrap steel (the charge) into the furnace. 2. After the charge melts, molten or cold iron is added. 3. Heating continues. Carbon from the iron becomes carbon monoxide gas. Impurities are separated and form slag.

## Basic Oxygen Furnace Steelmaking - Steel Technology
Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steel making or Basic Oxygen Furnace Steelmaking (BOS) or Linz-Donawitz-Verfahren steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method in which both molten pig iron and steel scrap are converted into steel with the oxidizing action of oxygen blown into the melt under a basic slag.

## Direct reduced iron process - tec-science
In the electric steel process, the sponge iron obtained from the direct reduced iron process is used for crude steel making. In general, scrap is also added to this process as well as pig iron from the blast furnace process. These components are then mixed in a special oven.
