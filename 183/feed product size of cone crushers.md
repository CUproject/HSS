Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

## Maximize your cone crusher productivity : Pit & Quarry
The maximum distance from which the feed material should fall from into the top of a small to mid-size cone crusher is 3 ft. When the feed material drops from a much greater distance, the stones tend to slam into the V-shaped crushing cavity with such velocity that it subjects the crusher to shock loads and extremely high stress levels.

As the feed moves towards the drive end of the cone crusher, its size decreases (due to the crushing action), and ever smaller pieces move towards the drive end of the crusher. After passing through the crusher, the product -now at a much-reduced size- is discharged through an opening in the bottom shell.
