## Silica fume advantages and disadvantages in concrete
Advantages of silica fume in concrete: (1) silica fume is a kind of neutral inorganic filler with very stable physical and chemical properties. It does not contain crystalline water, does not participate in the curing reaction, and does not affect the reaction mechanism. (2) good infiltration for various kinds of resin, good adsorption performance, easy .

## 8 Main Cement Ingredients & Their Functions - Civil Engineering
Silica: Silicon dioxide is known as silica, chemical formula SiO 2.. A sufficient quantity of silica should be present in cement to dicalcium and tricalcium silicate. Silica imparts strength to cement. Silica usually presents to the extent of about 30 percent cement.. Alumina: Alumina is Aluminium oxide.The chemical formula is Al 2 O 3.. Alumina imparts quick setting property to the cement.
