15. White Cement: The grey colour of the cement is caused by the presence of Iron oxide. By reducing the amount of Iron oxide in the cement to less than 1%, white cement can be obtained. White cement is made by using high purity limestone and china clay both of which are known to have low iron content. It is expensive than ordinary cement.
