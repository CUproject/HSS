## Commercial Lithium Production and Mining of Lithium - ThoughtCo
Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.

While it's cheap and effective, the process needs a lot of water, estimated at 500.000 gallons per ton of lithium extracted. This creates a lot of pressure in local communities living in nearby areas. For example, in Chile's Salar de Atacama, mining has caused the region to lose 65% of the region's water.

The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.

## Where Lithium Mining in the United States Stands Today - Solar Reviews
Apr 13, 2022It takes a fair amount of time before raw lithium or lithium-ion batteries reach the United States. Currently, the U.S. gets most of its lithium from South America or Australia. Typically, the mined lithium is processed and turned into batteries in China. That's at least two more continents the lithium lands in before the final product is complete.

## Thacker Pass Lithium Mine | NDEP - Nevada
The proposed Thacker Pass Lithium Mine would consist of open-pit mining and lithium processing operations. Using ore crushing, acid leaching, and processing methods, the mine would produce lithium carbonate — which would be turned into battery-grade lithium products.
