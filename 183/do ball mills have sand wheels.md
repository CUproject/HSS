## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

## Rod Mill
Overview. Rod mills are mainly used for primary grinding of crushed ore with a particle size range up to 50 mm for soft materials, and between 20 and 30 mm for harder materials where a narrow product size distribution is required (e.g. for subsequent gravity separation). Rod mills create a coarser product than do ball mills and typically operate at a slower mill speed.

If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.
