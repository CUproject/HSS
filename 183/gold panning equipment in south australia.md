## Gold mining in South Australia
This was particularly the case with Victoria in the 1850s and to Western Australia in the 1890s. Indirectly gold mining contributed greatly towards the development of the local agricultural and manufacturing industries. During its heyday between 1881 and 1892 more than seventeen thousand gold licences were granted in South Australia.
