## List of coal-fired power stations in the United States
This is a list of the 230 operational coal-fired power stations in the United States. Coal generated 23% of United States electricity in 2021, [1] an amount of electricity similar to that from renewable energy or nuclear power [2] [3] but about half of the amount generated by natural gas plants. Coal was 19% of generating capacity.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

Coastal power stations, due to their proximity to major urban areas, tend to be better managed in terms of production consistency and environmental standards. In China and India in particular, coastal power stations tend to mill coal more finely, use superior emissions to control technologies, and have a tendency to use higher-quality coal blends.
