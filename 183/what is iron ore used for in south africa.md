The iron ores, which are mainly the oxides, are reduced to iron with carbon (coke) at high temperatures in a blast furnace. Over 97% of this is converted directly to steel without even being allowed to solidify after leaving the furnace in which it is made. A relatively small amount is used as cast iron and wrought iron.
