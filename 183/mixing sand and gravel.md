Jan 20, 2022To create a mortar mix, the ratio basis is usually 3 or 4 parts of sand to one part of cement. However, It may vary how wet or dry you want the mixture to be. The ratio also depends on the strength you are trying to create. The standard concrete mix has the one part cement to the two parts of sand to the four parts of aggregates.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.
