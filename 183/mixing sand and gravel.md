## Can You Mix Mortar And Concrete? - CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION TIPS
Jan 20, 2022To create a mortar mix, the ratio basis is usually 3 or 4 parts of sand to one part of cement. However, It may vary how wet or dry you want the mixture to be. The ratio also depends on the strength you are trying to create. The standard concrete mix has the one part cement to the two parts of sand to the four parts of aggregates.

Jan 29, 2013. #7. I have sand for my corys to protect their barbels. If you add sand the sand will eventually end up under the gravel making a layer of sand and a layer of gravel (unless you mix it up a lot). To clean it I take the end of my gravel vacuum off and just use the tube so I don't suck up as much sand.

Answer (1 of 4): The black sands sold for aquaria are really a kilned, granulated clay product somewhat like kittylitter, not a true sand. They were invented for plant-based aquaria, where they stand in for planting soils. You can typically keep an aquarium planted in black sand for 8 to 10 year

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.
