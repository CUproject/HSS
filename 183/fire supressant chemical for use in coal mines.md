When a fire ignites, quickly containing and extinguishing the flames is critical, before the hazard becomes uncontrollable. Famous Coal Fires. One infamous fire began in Centralia, Pennsylvania in 1962 when the town burned garbage in the local landfill which was located near a coal mine, which caused the deposit to heat up and initiate combustion.
