## Copper - Vale
Copper. Copper, that reddish-orange metal that has been used to benefit civilization since 8000 B.C. is one of the most important metals used by modern industry. Prized for its ability to conduct heat and electricity, it is an element that helps facilitate the world as we know it, and is a focus of Vale's investment.

Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.
