Mining is a process of extraction of valuable minerals or geological substances from the earth; however, mining degrades the ecosystem. Earlier studies have discovered that about 10-15% of the ore mined is not utilized and discarded due to lack of cost-effective extraction technology for low graded ore in India.

The cyanide solution strength is also important in leaching gold, with the typical range of solution being in the 0.02% -0.05% NaCN. The gold particle size has a tremendous effect on the time required for dissolution in a cyanide solution. Generally, the finer the gold, the quicker it will dissolve. A 45 micron particle of gold would dissolve

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

## Small Locally Using Sodium Cyanide For Leaching Gold From Ore
Typical set-up of a small Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) plant, locally called mini-CIP, in Diwalwal, using sodium cyanide (NaCN) for leaching gold from milled and amalgamated ore. Gold loaded activated carbon being burned to ash in the center and an agitated tank for cyanidation in the drum below the roof to the right, behind waste and
