## Stainless steel raw material cost advantage | Stainless Steel Mill
In terms of the current situation, the Yangtze river spot nickel price is 126400 yuan/ton, the price is RMB 116 / nickel, less than 181 yuan. So for smelting stainless steel raw materials, high nickel iron compared with nickel plate more cost advantage. Second, scrap stainless steel and high nickel pig iron cost comparison.

## About Stainless Steel Materials - The Why and The How
One reason for this is that stainless steels, like other metals, tend to be heavier but also stronger and tougher than plastics. Stainless steel materials, in particular, also have great corrosion resistance. This blend of corrosion resistance and toughness is a major reason why the stainless steels are so useful for making valves.
