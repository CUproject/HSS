Dolomitizing brines produced in a supratidal or intertidal setting (identical with the settings described above) are simply flushed down through deeper, underlying limestones. Such fluids would be propelled downward by their higher density, though some might follow fault zones, cracks, and fissures.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Purposes - JM Fertilizo
Dolomite as a mineral has very few uses. However, dolostone has an enormous number of uses because it occurs in deposits that are large enough to mine. The most common use for dolostone is in the construction industry. It is crushed and sized for use as a road base material, an aggregate in concrete and asphalt, railroad ballast, rip-rap, or fill.
