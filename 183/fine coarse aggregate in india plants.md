Malek K. Batayneh et al, (2008).A research was carried out to find a positive method for disposing non-decaying materials, such as reuse in concrete mixes. Crumb rubber was used in the concrete mix to partially substitute for fine aggregate (sand) in various percentages of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%. For each mix, cubes of 100x100x100 mm

## Difference Between Fine Aggregate and Coarse Aggregate
But when high performance concrete is required where the strength of concrete is close to the strength of the aggregate, fine aggregate is needed so that there is no weakness in the structure. It is important to mix both fine and coarse aggregate in concrete as coarse aggregate cannot cover the surface area in the manner that fine aggregate does.

## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties & Uses in construction
1.Size of fine aggregates: The largest size that falls under the limit of the exact set is 4.75 mm. Using the largest size will give more dense concrete, but a mixture of all sizes is more desirable and more economical. If cement mortar is prepared for masonry work or plastering work, very fine types of sand of similar size is used.
