## Design method for cadmium and arsenic contamination  - ScienceDirect
Thus, this paper first analyzes the potential forms of cadmium and arsenic in coal during conventional coal mining, and then a new mining technology is proposed for reducing cadmium and arsenic pollution during mining process. Meanwhile, the control method and design flow have been researched in the mining process of this new technology.

## Cadmium
Cadmium is a chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury.Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11.

Cadmium, a rare but widely dispersed element, is found naturally in the environment. Most cadmium ore (greenockite): occurs in association with zinc. It is released into the environment through mining and smelting, its use in various industrial processes, and enters the food chain from uptake by plants from contaminated soil or water.

Cadmium is used to make low-temperature melting alloys, such as solder and Wood's Metal for indoor sprinkler systems. The latter is an alloy of 50%Bi, 25%Pb, 12.5% Sn, and 12.5%Cd which melts at about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a very hot shower. Cadmium compounds are used both in black and white and color television tubes.
