Permeability - Berea Sandstone™ Petroleum Cores. In geology, permeability is a measure of the ability of a material (typically, a rock or unconsolidated alluvial material) to transmit fluids through it. It is of great importance in determining the flow characteristics of hydrocarbons in oil and gas reservoirs, and of groundwater in aquifers.

Core samples of Berea and Bentheimer sandstones were used as porous mediums for ﬂooding process. Dimensions and physical properties of the samples are listed in Table 2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of both sandstone rocks (Figs. 1, 2) unveils rocks rich of quartz with slight amount of kaolinite clay. Kaolinite is more in Berea rock (6.5%

## Berea Sandstone Cores | Cleveland Quarries
The Berea Sandstone™ has excellent, uniform material properties. Researchers throughout the world have performed thousands of core flooding tests using the Berea Sandstone™ to characterize the oil production in other sandstone reservoirs during primary, secondary, and tertiary oil flooding. The literature is filled with published results of
