## design of underground crushing cylindrical grinding
Our design entailed an underground crushing chamber with dual ore passes and an associated material handling system. At the top, heavy duty grizzlies and rock breaker arrangements accept the run-of-mine ore from production operations, while discharge chutes at the bottom—complete with Ross Feeders—supply the main vibrating grizzly feeder.

## Double Roll Crushers | McLanahan
Heavy-Duty Double Roll Crushers are ideal for the primary, secondary and tertiary crushing of limestone, gypsum, ROM coal, etc. where higher compressive strength material is anticipated. Due to the V-belt drive design, a lower horsepower is required compared to other crushers designed for the same applications. Shalemaster Double Roll Crushers
