## Mining | National Geographic Society
May 20, 2022Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Once the process of mining, transporting, and crushing the ore to a golf-sized ball is accomplished, it is further processed and reduced to pebbles and then to sand like particles. It is then added with liquid to make it a slurry which is a combination of valuable copper ore minerals and "worthless" rock, called gangue.

## How Does Copper Mining Affect the Environment? | Calgary
Aug 11, 2022Copper ore is most commonly mined through a process called open-pit mining. This process is also used to extract aluminum, gold, iron, and uranium. Open-pit mines are vast holes dug in the ground with slopes that look like staircases, called benches.  Depending on where the ore is located, copper mining can severely damage the environment

## Copper Mining and Processing: Life Cycle of a Mine | Superfund
Prospecting and exploration are precursors to mining and often occur simultaneously; together, they can take two to eight years to complete, and may cost from $500,000 to $15 million overall. Prospecting is the process of searching the region for mineral deposits. Historically, prospectors would explore a region on foot with a pick and shovel.

Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to
