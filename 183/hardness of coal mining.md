## Calcite mining and processing plant
The last hard coal mine in Poland was opened. It was a Budryk coal mine in Ornontowice, belonging to Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa (JSW). In the Budryk coal mine, there is the deepest level of coal extracting - 1290 m. Soon JSW will complete the construction of a new Bzie-Dębina mine - its opening is planned for 2022.

## Addressing Hard Coal Emissions | Energy Industry Review
This means Poland's share of Europe's hard coal emissions has doubled from 16% in 2013 to 33% in 2019. Poland needs to urgently address not only its lignite emissions, but also its hard coal emissions. Poland's coal power accounts for 62% of its EU ETS emissions. The steel sector makes up 8% of EU ETS emissions.

There are different ways of estimating coal strength and hardness—compressive strength, fracture toughness, or grindability—but all will show a trend relative to rank, type, and grade of the coal. The measurement of coal strength is affected by the size of the test specimen, the orientation of stress relative to banding, and the confining pressure of the test (Hobbs, 1964; Zipf and

There are four major types (or "ranks") of coal. Rank refers to steps in a slow, natural process called "coalification," during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser, drier, more carbon-rich, and harder material. The four ranks are: Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard, brittle, and black lustrous coal, often referred to as hard coal, containing a high
