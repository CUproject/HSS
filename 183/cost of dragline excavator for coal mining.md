## Dragline Mining & Reclamation Mining
A 4.5 mile overland raw coal conveyor installed in 1988 greatly reduces the coal truck haul to the preparation plant. The feasibility of a dragline operation at Hobet 07 was prompted primarily by the favorable operation the BE 1570 experienced at Hobet 21. The mine plan at this site would be basically similar to that of the other operation.
