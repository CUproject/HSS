##  EPS 50 Lab 01: Properties of Minerals and Rocks
Each mineral has different physical and chemical properties. Physical properties you will use to identify the minerals include color, streak, hardness, luster, density, habit, cleavage, magnetism, fluorescence, and reaction to chemicals. Refer to Appendix 3 in the back of your book or any reference book for properties of common minerals.

## What Are Minerals? - Types, Properties & Examples - Geology In
Some minerals break very nicely along smooth planes, and this is called cleavage. Minerals that break this way do so because their atoms are arranged so that they break apart from each other along these planes. Mica is an example of a mineral that has cleavage. If a mineral fractures, it breaks in uneven ways that are not flat or parallel

## mineral - Classification of minerals | Britannica
Classification of minerals. Since the middle of the 19th century, minerals have been classified on the basis of their chemical composition.Under this scheme, they are divided into classes according to their dominant anion or anionic group (e.g., halides, oxides, and sulfides).Several reasons justify use of this criterion as the distinguishing factor at the highest level of mineral classification.

## Rocks and Minerals - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)
Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.

## What are Minerals? | What are Mineral Properties? - Geology
There are approximately 4000 different minerals, and each of those minerals has a unique set of physical properties. These include: color, streak, hardness, luster, diaphaneity, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, magnetism, solubility, and many more. These physical properties are useful for identifying minerals.
