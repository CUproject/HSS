In a power plant, BOP stands for 'Balance Of Plant'. In a thermal power plant, the main equipments are, TG (Turbine & Generator) SG (Steam Generator, ie. Boiler & its auxiliaries) This TG & SG are collectively known as BTG (Boiler, Turbine, Generator). Boiler and its auxiliaries generate high pressure and high temperature steam.

1. THERMAL POWER PLANT A thermal power plant is a power plant in which the prime mover is stream. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a Rankine cycle.
