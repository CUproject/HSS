## Calculating Conveyor Power for Bulk Handling | Rulmeca Corp
We use a modified version of the Conveyor Equipment Manufacturers Association guidelines. The primary equation for Effective Tension, Te, is as follows: Te = LKt (Kx + KyWb + 0.015Wb) + Wm (LKy + H) + Tp + Tam + Tac.

## Power - Commonteq
Power. Screw Conveyor. The calculation according to ISO . Applies only to conveyors. If machine working as feeder (although the design may be identical - the process of operation is different) the power of the motor should be greater due to start at full fill - more torque will be needed.

The tractive pull multiplied by the drive pulley radius will give you the load torque. There is no short cut for deciding the load torque. This cannot be calculated from motor side. 5) Having decided the load torque, you can decide the required power at motor shaft, available motor size, gear ratio and so on.

## Screw conveyor
A screw conveyor or auger conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw blade, called a "flighting", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular materials.They are used in many bulk handling industries. Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi-solid materials, including food waste, wood chips
