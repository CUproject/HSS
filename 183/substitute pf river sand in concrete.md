## Why Air Entraining Agents Enable the use of Crushed Sand in Concrete?
Jun 2, 2021With the correct air entrainment, concrete containing artificial sand will have a substantial gain. The additive enables the use of crushed sand in the cementitious mix with up to 100% replacement of natural sand. If applied correctly, even sands from construction demolition are suitable substitutes for river sand.

## Waste Foundry Sand in Concrete Production Instead of Natural River Sand 
Mar 23, 2022The by-product of the foundry industry is waste foundry sand (WFS). The use of WFS in building materials will safeguard the ecosystem and environmental assets while also durable construction. The use of industrial waste in concrete offsets a shortage of environmental sources, solves the waste dumping trouble and provides another method of protecting the environment.
