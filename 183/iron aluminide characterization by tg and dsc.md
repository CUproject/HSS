Tg. In fact, there are actually 5 accepted ways in which the Tg of a material can be assigned by DSC, as is represented in the following figure. Tb represents the very start of the detection of the change in heat flow or heat capacity at Tg, T1 is the onset temperature, Tg is the mid-point temperature and the most commonly accepted way of

## Iron aluminide
Iron aluminides are intermetallic compounds of iron and aluminium - they typically contain ~18% Al or more.. Good oxide and sulfur resistance, with strength comparable to steel alloys, and low cost of materials have made these compounds of metallurgical interest - however low ductility and issues with hydrogen embrittlement are barriers to their processing and use in structural applications.

Iron (atomic symbol: Fe, atomic number: 26) is a Block D, Group 8, Period 4 element with an atomic weight of 55.845. The number of electrons in each of Iron's shells is 2, 8, 14, 2 and its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d 6 4s. The iron atom has a radius of 126 pm and a Van der Waals radius of 194 pm. Iron was discovered by humans before 5000 BC.

An aluminide is a compound that has aluminium with more electropositive elements. [contradictory] Since aluminium is near the nonmetals on the periodic table, it can bond with metals differently from other metals.The properties of an aluminide are between those of a metal alloy and those of an ionic compound.

## Dry Sliding Wear of a Powder Metallurgy Copper-based Metal Matrix 
In the present study, dry sliding wear behavior of a powder metallurgy copper alloy matrix composite containing iron aluminide (Fe 3 Al) intermetallic particles was investigated using a pin-on-disk machine. A sintered copper alloy (Cu—90%, Sn—10%) was used as matrix.
