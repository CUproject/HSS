## Strength and stiffness of compacted crushed concrete aggregate
The strength and stiffness of CCA with a maximum particle size D max =37.5 mm obtained from a typical concrete crushing plant are noticeably lower than CCA sieved to D max =19 mm compacted using the same energy. However, when compacted to the same dry density, the original CCA exhibits the strength and stiffness higher than the sieved CCA.

## Gravel Calculator - Calculate how much gravel you need
To calculate how much gravel you need to cover a rectangular area you need to multiply the volume by the gravel density. The volume formula for a rectangular (or square) box in cubic feet is height (ft) x width (ft) x length (ft), as seen in the figure below: For example, to fill a box with a width of 3ft and a length of 6ft, to a depth of 1ft

I'm putting in some slotted drainage pipe (french drain) in my yard and I'm trying to calculate the amount of stone I'll need to fill the trench. I just can't find a good approximation for the density of crushed limestone (my supplier sells by the ton, not the yard). The closest I found was one ton is equivalent to approx 16 cubic feet.

Cement density:- generally density of cement is around 1440kg/m3 or it is measured in other unit- their density is 1.440 in g/cm3, 94 in lb/ft3 and 14.40 in kn/m3. The cement mixed with fine aggregate produces cement mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel produces concrete. Ans. 1440 kg/m3 is density of cement.

## Compaction Equipment and Methods: Compaction of Gravel and Soil
There are methods to test moisture content like the standard proctor compaction test or the nuclear density meter, though for preparing a hardscape you will be able to test the density of your base using a penetrometer if necessary.  compacting crushed rock, or compacting gravel of any sort, we need to recognize the best piece of equipment
