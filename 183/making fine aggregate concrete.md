##  Aggregates for Use In Concrete
Fine aggregate will pass the # 4 sieve â¢ Coarse Natural or crushed stone 3/8" to 1 Â½" (or more) Coarse aggregate is larger than a #4 sieve 4  When sand containing lignite is used in making concrete, lignite particles near the surface can expand and cause the pop outs. Lignite is often referred to as brown coal, it is the lowest rank
