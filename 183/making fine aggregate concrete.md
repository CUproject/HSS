## Creating a concrete mix with smooth texture
After you've poured your mix into the mold, level it out and make sure no air pockets are below the surface. Within a few minutes the setting process begins.

##  Aggregates for Use In Concrete
Fine aggregate will pass the # 4 sieve • Coarse Natural or crushed stone 3/8" to 1 ½" (or more) Coarse aggregate is larger than a #4 sieve 4  When sand containing lignite is used in making concrete, lignite particles near the surface can expand and cause the pop outs. Lignite is often referred to as brown coal, it is the lowest rank
