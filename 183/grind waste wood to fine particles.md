## Wood Smoke and Your Health | US EPA
Aug 30, 2022Health effects of wood smoke. Smoke may smell good, but it's not good for you. The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles, also called fine particulate matter or PM2.5. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system, where they may cause burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses, such as bronchitis.

Jul 30, 2021After pre-grinding and metal separation, waste wood in class A1 is usually suitable for grate firing. It can also used in dust firing methods after a process of fine grinding. Hammer mills by Tietjen are often used in these settings. The aim is harness the complete energetic potential of waste wood as a raw material.

## Particle Size Reduction Strategies | BioCycle
Grinders, shredders and chippers are used for size reduction of wood wastes, yard trimmings, land-clearing debris, and in some cases, food waste. The primary objective of this equipment is to reduce large particles to small particles by physically breaking them apart, although it can be used for mixing, to some extent.

Fine wood powders have advantages over traditional coarse wood particles for various emerging applications. However, an efficient system to produce fine wood powders has not been well established. We investigated the comminution capability and efficiency of a two-stage grinding system consisting of a hammer mill circuit and an rotor impact mill circuit to convert wood feedstocks into fine powders.
