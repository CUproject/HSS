5 Simple Methods to Test Gold Dusts. 1. Sunlight Method. Take a few sample of the gold dusts that you recovered and expose it under the sunlight. An authentic gold will "shine" but it will not "sparkle". If the particles sparkled under sunlight, it means that you have found pyrites (also known as "Fool's Gold" ). 2.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
