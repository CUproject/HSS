## tungsten processing | Britannica
tungsten processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Tungsten exhibits a body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal lattice. It has the highest melting point of all metals, 3,410° C (6,170° F), and it has high conductivity for electricity. Owing to this unique combination of properties, it is used extensively as filaments for incandescent lamps, as electric contacts, and as
