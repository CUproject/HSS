## 6 Points in the Production Process to Optimize Cement Making
Here are six categories of cement production that have potential for optimization. Raw Materials. The first step in the cement process is the recovery of the limestone and sometimes the extraction of clay. Online elemental analyzers can monitor material chemistry in real time, allowing for adjustments that will help extend the life of the quarry.

## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.

## Homogenization of Cement Raw Meal - AGICO Cement Plant
The raw meal preparation process of the cement industry includes four links: mining, pre-homogenization, grinding, and homogenization, which form the homogenization chain of raw meal preparation. Raw meal homogenization is the most important process link of the four, accounting for 40% of the homogenization task.

Sep 23, 2021Gravel, sand, water, and cement make up hollow blocks. They produce light gray blocks with high compression strength and surface texture. Replacing gravel and sand with slate, shale, and clay makes lightweight hollow blocks. Expanded slate, shale, and clay are made by crushing the raw materials and heating them to 1093 Celsius.

When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.
