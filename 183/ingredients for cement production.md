Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

ADVERTISEMENTS: For the production of cement concrete, water is one of the most important ingredients as hydration of cement is possible only in the presence of water. The hydration of cement forms gel which on hardening gives strength to the concrete. Thus concrete of any type cannot be prepared without water.

Lime. About 60 - 65 % of cement constitutes of lime which contributes to the strength. Proper care should be taken in proportion to make the cement sound and strong, as an excess of lime makes the cement unsound and causes the cement to expand and disintegrate. In case, if lime is deficient, the strength of the cement is reduced and sets quickly.
