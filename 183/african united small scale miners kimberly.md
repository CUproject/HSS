Jan 15, 2021· Some of the poorest people in the world's poorest countries eke out a living in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Equipped with primitive tools like picks, shovels, buckets, and gold pans, they work mining valuable resources, like gold, diamonds, tin, lithium, rare earth elements, tantalum, and cobalt, and any other usable commodity, for example, sand, coal, or mica.

## Solar can save small-scale miners - WhyAfrica
May 11, 2022In paper thin marginal operations like quarries or small-scale diamond mines, where owners are always looking to reduce running costs, solar power is almost a no-brainer. This is especially true in the Northern Cape, where the sun shines for an average of between 272 and 300 hours per month. Energy makes up 15-40% of a mine's operating costs.

## Small-Scale Mining in Africa: Tackling Pressing Environmental Problems 
Small-scale mining—low-tech mineral extraction and processing—has long been an important industry in Africa. For centuries, operations have provided inhabitants of the rural, more impoverished regions of the continent with a wealth of employment benefits and, more recently, have made important contributions to mineral wealth and foreign exchange earnings.

Across the African continent, estimates put the number of such miners around 8 million. Roughly another 45 million are thought to depend on their income. According to the United Nations' African Mining Vision, almost 20 percent of Africa's gold production and nearly all the gemstone production besides diamonds are mined by small-scale miners.
