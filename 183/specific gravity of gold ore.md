Rocks like these contain mostly black, white and/or gray minerals . Sedimentary rocks such as limestone or shale are hardened sediment with sandy or clay.

## specific gravity test for gold nuggets
Example demonstrates how to perform the specific gravity test to calculate the gold content of nuggets mixed with other materials, such as quartz.  4.17 - 2.63 (the average specific gravity of quartz) = 1.54 1.54 x 23.5 = 36.19. 36.19 divided by the constant 25.97 = 1.39 ounces of contained gold
