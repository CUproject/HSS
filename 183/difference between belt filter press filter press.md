## Solid-liquid filtration: Understanding filter presses and belt filters
08 Oct 2012. Filter presses and belt filters are the workhorses of the solid-liquid filtration world. Together they account for a significant portion of the slurry de-watering and washing procedures that take place in industry. Trevor Sparks outlines some of the advantages and disadvantages of these different technologies and suggests some ways

Folding Belt Filter Press. The V-FOLD is like a conveyor with filter fabric as the belt. It differs from other belt presses by using a single belt made from conventional filter fabrics with a reinforced centre-line. As it moves slowly forward the belt folds along the centre to form a "V-shaped" cavity that can hold feed slurry.

## Dewatering Technology: Screw Presses vs. Filter Presses
The choice between the screw press and filter press for water treatment depends on your business' unique needs. However, not only do filter presses perform better than screw presses, their initial installation also costs less than that of the screw press. The filter press does incur the additional cost of filter replacement.
