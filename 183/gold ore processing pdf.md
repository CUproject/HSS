## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

Gold deposits occur in a number of different geological settings, only a few of which are host to refractory gold ores. A knowledge of the link between the geological setting of a gold deposit and potential processing problems could be an important factor in the early stages of deposit targeting, an increasingly important phase of exploration.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process
