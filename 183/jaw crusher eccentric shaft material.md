## Proper crusher lubrication - Tip of the Week - Lube Talk - Mobil
Jaw crushers: In jaw crushers, a large feed opening receives material. There are two outer bearings located on either side of the main frame to support an eccentric shaft. There are also two inner bearings - known as "pitman" bearings - that support a moveable jaw. The reciprocating motion of the shaft moves the pitman against

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
The Jaw Crusher was first introduced by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858 as a double-toggle Jaw Crusher. Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first modern era overhead eccentric Jaw Crushers. On the overhead eccentric style Jaw Crusher, the moving swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft with heavy-duty double

## What is a Jaw Crusher - Quarrying & Aggregates
When working, the motor drives the belt and pulley to move the movable jaw up and down through the eccentric shaft. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate, and the material passes through the two jaws.

## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has, basically, two shafts and two toggle plates.
