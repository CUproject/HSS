Sep 17, . Director of Finance and Communication for the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, Francis Opoku says small-scale miners only make up 25% of all miners in the country. He said a chunk of the other miners are engaged in illegal mining activities, thus have not been licensed and are not members of the Association.
