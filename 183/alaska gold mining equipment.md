## Gold Mining Legacy in Juneau, Alaska - Roy Stevenson
AJ Gold Mining Company. The AJ Gold Mining Company was really an agglomeration of 23 claims, first organized on May 6, 1897. Drilling started in 1911 to access the Deep North ore in Silver Bow Basin and mining operations continued non-stop, except for July 4 and Christmas until the mine's closure on April 9 1944.
