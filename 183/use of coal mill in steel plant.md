Steel is produced via two main routes: the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route and electric arc furnace (EAF) route. The BF-BOF route is used for 71% of steel produced, whilst the EAF route accounts for 29% of steel produced. The key difference between these routes is the material used to produce the steel and the plant configuration.

## Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives
By Noah Beecher Kelk Metallurgical coal, also called metcoal or coking coal, is a type of coal that is used in the production of steel. It is of a higher purity than thermal coal which is used in energy generation. To make steel, metcoal is heated at around 1100 degrees C to remove water and other chemicals. This is done without the presence of oxygen. The result is a lump of near-pure carbon

Types of coal pulverizers. Coal pulverizers may be classified by speed, as follows: Low Speed; Medium Speed; High Speed; Low speed Ball and tube mills. A ball mill is a pulverizer that consists of a horizontal rotating cylinder, up to three diameters in length, containing a charge of tumbling or cascading steel balls, pebbles, or rods.

Aug 5, 2021The Ball mill pulveriser is basically horizontal cylindrical tube rotating at low speed on its axis, whose length is slightly more to its diameter. The inside of the Cylinder shell is fitted with heavy cast liners and is filled with cast or forged balls for grinding, to approximately 1/3 of the diameter. Raw coal to be ground is fed from the

## What is coking coal used for in steel production?
Score: 4.9/5 (38 votes) . Coking coal is an essential input for production of iron and steel. The largest single use of coal in the steel industry is as a fuel for the blast furnace and for the production of metallurgical coke for reduction of iron ore or for injection with the hot blast.

## use of coal mill in steel plant
Mar 04, 2021 0183 32 The coke plant produces coking coal, which is used in the blast furnace both as a heat source and to reduce iron H2 -BF has the potential to reduce emissions both in the coke plant and blast furnace because i t reduces the amount of coal needed and only forms water after reacting with iron ore instead of carbon dioxide
