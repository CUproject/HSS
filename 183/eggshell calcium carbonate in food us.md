##  Facilities of bread enrichment with calcium by using eggshell powder
Eggshell components are inorganic salts (91.87%), the main ones of which are calcium carbonate (98.4%), magnesium carbonate (0.8%), tricalcium phosphate (0.8%) (Dri et al., 2011). Chemical composition of white and brown eggshells is slightly different. A little more calcium is in a white eggshell powder

## Calcium Carbonate Content In Eggshells [pon2o0d70ml0]
A good quality eggshell will contain, on average, 2.2 grams of calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. Approximately 94% of a dry eggshell is calcium carbonate and has a typical mass of 5.5 grams,1 although these values can differ depending on sources. Amounts as low as 78% have been published.

## Progress of Bio-Calcium Carbonate Waste Eggshell and Seashell Fillers 
Disposal of massive amounts of eggshells and seashells from processing industries is a challenge. In recent years, there has been a focus to reuse these waste resources in the production of new thermoplastic and thermoset polymer materials. This paper reviews eggshell and seashell production by country and provides a perspective on the quantity of bio-calcium carbonate that could be produced

Quail eggshell represents 10% of the total egg weight, has a high calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) content, and a considerable content of protein; however, it has limited perceived value as a co-product of the egg processing industry. Therefore, eggshell disposal remains a problem for the industry, and the main destination is agriculture.
