## Optimising concrete with recycled sand, aggregates - Quarry
LOGICAL ANSWER. To combat depleting natural sand and aggregate resources we should better utilise the abundant incoming CD&E waste stream. In its appraisal, concrete produced from recycled sand and aggregates is unfairly pitted against higher strength concrete produced using virgin aggregates, such as granite or basalt, and natural sand.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids. Well-shaped natural sands are ideal for workability of mixtures.

## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.
