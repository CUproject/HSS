Limestone is a carbonate mineral. After calcination at a certain temperature, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are decomposed and carbon dioxide (CO2) is released. Calcium oxide is the main component of calcined limestone. The reaction equation is as follows: Calcination of limestone is usually carried out in lime kilns.

## Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate - RSC Education
In association with Nuffield Foundation. Calcium carbonate is strongly heated until it undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The calcium oxide (unslaked lime) is dissolved in water to form calcium hydroxide (limewater). Bubbling carbon dioxide through this forms a milky suspension of calcium carbonate.

Aug 2, 2022As it stands, calcium carbonate (in pure form or as limestone) is used as a carrier for most premixed products (drugs, vitamins, trace minerals, nutritional additives and even some concentrates).

## Methods Of Production Of Calcium Carbonate From Limestone
Production Methods. 1. Light calcium carbonate: from limestone to produce light calcium carbonate, including calcination, digestion, carbonation, separation, drying, grinding and other processes. Calcium carbonate content of raw materials in limestone should be more than 96%, about 1% magnesium salt, iron, aluminum oxide in 0.5% or less
