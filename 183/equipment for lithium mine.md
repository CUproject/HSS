## Fracking vs. Lithium Mining: What's the Difference? - Green Matters
Oct 22, 2020Based on what is currently known, fracking is a much more dangerous process than lithium mining, but unfortunately, both seem to be essential to the world today. Many countries, companies, industries, and individuals are dependent on oil and natural gas. They need their devices to live and work and adapt to an increasingly technological world.

## Lithium
Lithium (from Greek: λίθος, romanized: lithos, lit. 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal.Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element.Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as

## Lithium mining is booming — here's how to manage its impact
Aug 11, 2021Commonly, extracting lithium from these deposits involves two methods. One is building a mine, extracting the clay or ore, and separating the metal through a complex process. The second is to pump underground water deposits to the surface. The resulting pools of briny liquid are left to evaporate, and lithium is removed from the dried salts

## batteries - Is Lithium mining any better for the environment than 
A friend of mine is adamant that the extraction of lithium for batteries (and the creation of battery cells themselves) is a very environmentally-damaging procedure, potentially even more-so than oil (open-cut mines vs oil wells), and that this is only going to get worse as more and more EV cars hit the roads, age, and need their batteries replaced.
