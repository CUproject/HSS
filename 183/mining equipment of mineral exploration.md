## Mineral Exploration - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mineral exploration is a complete sequence of activities. It ranges between searching for a new mineral prospect (reconnaissance) and evaluation of the property for economic mining (feasibility study). It also includes augmentation of additional ore reserves and resources in the mine and total mining district.

## Rock tumbling mineral oil-expeerts
Rock Identification Tips. First, decide whether your rock is igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. Igneous rocks such as granite or lava are tough, frozen melts with little texture or layering. Rocks like these contain mostly black, white and/or gray minerals . Sedimentary rocks such as limestone or shale are hardened sediment with sandy or clay.

Mineral exploration involves drilling to probe the contents of known ore deposits and potential sites to produce rock chips and samples of the core. Drilling is used in areas that have been identified as targets with potential deposits based on geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys which have led to the design of the drilling programme.
