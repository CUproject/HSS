## Belt Conveyor - Datasheet | Vention
As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm. In this case our variables are 20kg for mass, 0.5m/s^2 for acceleration, 10 degrees for angle theta, and 120N for deformation force.
