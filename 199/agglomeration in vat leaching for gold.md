## Hydrometallurgy - Leaching - Vat Leaching - LiquiSearch
Vat Leaching. Vat leaching involves contacting material, which has usually undergone size reduction and classification, with leach solution in large tanks or vats. Often the vats are equipped with agitators to keep the solids in suspension in the vats and improve the solid to liquid contact. After vat leaching, the leached solids and pregnant

## Review of Agglomeration Practice and Fundamentals in Heap Leaching 
Both industries prefer drum to conveyor agglomeration, particularly for clayey ore or ore having a high fines content. Precious metal heap leaching operations opt for cement in a dosage from 2.5 to 10 kg cement/t of ore (5-20 lb/ton) added to a cyanide solution. Copper ores are agglomerated with water and up to 40 kg sulfuric acid/t of ore

Agglomeration immobilizes the fine particles and therefore improves heap permeability to fluid flow.

## Heap leaching
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the

## Vat Leach
Continuous Vat Leaching; combining the efficiency of agitated tank leaching with the simplicity of heap leaching, Continuous Vat Leaching is revolutionizing the mineral processing industry. A no compromise solution to traditional leaching methods. Engineered to perform in the most demanding environments - extreme heat, high rainfall, lack of water and freezing temperatures are no longer a

##  HEAP LEACHING Experience-based approach to successful heap leach pad design
heap leach pad design H eap leaching has been applied to a number of different ores containing metals including gold, silver, copper, nickel, zinc and uranium. The ore can be processed as coarse rock, normally referred to as a dump leach, or as a crushed ore in a heap leach. The reagents used and the chemistry of leaching are metal

The standard cyanide leach process consists of grinding the ore to about. 80% - 200 mesh, mixing the ore/water grinding slurry with about 2 pounds. per ton of sodium cyanide and enough quick lime to keep the pH of the solution. at about 11.0. At a slurry concentration of 50% solids, the slurry passes.
