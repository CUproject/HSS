## Quarry
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.). There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was

The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

Quarry production remained strong in the early decades of the 20th century. The eventual discovery of new stone-producing areas and the rise of concrete led to a decline in the state's production of stone products by mid-century. The main quarry types in the state are granite, sandstone, and limestone.
