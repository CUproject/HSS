Granular material consisting of rounded, water-worn rock fragments 2 mm to 75 mm in diameter, usually found intermixed with sand. Or a mix of stone, sand and fine sized particles used as sub-base, base or surfacing on a gravel road. In some regions, it may be called aggregate. High-Density Aggregate.

## Aggregate Crushers - High-efficiency And Eco-friendly
Aggregate crushers can crush and process construction waste into concrete sand and gravel aggregates that meet production requirements. Recycled sand and gravel aggregates have similar properties to natural sand and gravel, which can be sued to configure concrete or mortar or be used as raw materials for the production of bricks.

mechanical behavior of granular materials using a discrete element method (DEM). To enable particle crushing, non-crushable elementary particles are boned together to represents the granular aggregates which can be crushed when the external force exceeds its strength. The flaw of the aggregate was also modeled by randomly distributed void.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
