Magnetic susceptibility is χ>0 which means it is always a small positive value for paramagnetic materials. These materials are temperature dependent and are weekly attracted by magnets with relative permeability 1.00001 to 1.003. Alkaline earth metal, aluminium, oxygen etc are some of the examples of paramagnetic materials.
