The submerged ash conveyor collects ash from under a wood fired or biomass-fired energy system. The water level is controlled by a float switch and in a separate container that is connected via a bottom pipe to the conveyor to keep the float clean and the float switch activates a solenoid valve for makeup water to fill the conveyor and maintain

##  4. Biomass Preparation
Fuel metering consists of the controlled delivery of the required amount of biomass to the energy conversion process. In the systems considered here, the biomass is metered as it is discharged from the silo to the collecting conveyor. An auger at the base of the silo feeds a conveyor, which then feeds a surge bin.

Apr 28, 2021Thermal Conversions - These are processes that utilize heat to change the chemical structure of biomass into a better and more usable fuel. The thermochemical conversions are torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification. The main difference between these conversions is the environment (oxygen levels and heat) to where the biomass is exposed.
