## Crushing in Mineral Processing - Eastman Rock Crusher
The picture above shows an example of how the crushing plant can be divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. The aggregate produced in a primary crusher is classified using a screen into a 0-20 mm fraction and typically a 20-150 mm fraction. The 0-20 mm fraction contains soil etc. and is generally considered to be of poor quality.
