## Zinc mining
Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining.A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc minerals in ore as its primary product. Common co-products in zinc ores include minerals of lead and silver.Other mines may produce zinc minerals as a by-product of the production of ores containing more valuable minerals or metals, such as

## N$6,5 billion approved for Skorpion Zinc revival - M i N M E T
Jun 16, 2021The Namzinc Refinery Conversion project would enable Skorpion Zinc Mine to treat sulphides and oxides to produce the refined metal. Once the existing refinery is modified, it will facilitate the processing of zinc sulphide concentrate along with the oxide ore until the end of the mine's lifespan, after which zinc sulphide can be treated until

## Zinc Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The zinc mining process is conducted primarily underground, with more than 80 percent of all zinc extracted beneath the Earth's surface. Eight percent of zinc is mined in open pits, with the remaining 12 percent being mined through both methods. Once it's removed from the earth, the concentrate is roasted at a temperature of 950 degrees
