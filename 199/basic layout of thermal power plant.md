## Thermal Power Plant - Basic, Definition, Parts, Working Principle
A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.

## What Is a Thermal Power Plant? Operation and Types
The typical thermal power plant is divided into several segments: a boiler, a turbine, an alternator, and a condenser. In the boiler the fuel is burned to obtain thermal energy. With this energy a fluid is heated to obtain water vapor. Steam is used to drive a steam turbine in this way, the internal energy of the steam is converted into

## Thermal Power Plant: Definition, Layout, Working, Site Selection 
Thermal Power Plant is an electric producing power plant in which fuel (such as coal, liquefied fuel, uranium, and natural resources) is used to generate heat and that heat is further utilized to heat the water to make steam and that steam is used to rotate the turbine and further electricity generates with the help of 3 phase supply generator.

## Thermal power station
A thermal power station is a type of power station in which heat energy is converted to electrical energy.In a steam-generating cycle heat is used to boil water in a large pressure vessel to produce high-pressure steam, which drives a steam turbine connected to an electrical generator.The low-pressure exhaust from the turbine enters a steam condenser where it is cooled to produce hot
