## Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal
The high carbon dioxide emission factor for anthracite reflects the coal's relatively small hydrogen content, which lowers its heating value. (11) In pounds of carbon dioxide per million Btu, U.S. average factors are 227.4 for anthracite, 216.3 for lignite, 211.9 for subbituminous coal, and 205.3 for bituminous coal. Table FE4.

## Coal liquefaction Hero Dictionary
Coal liquefaction is a process of converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons:  (DCL) as a way to convert lignite into synthetic oil in 1913. Coal liquefaction was an important part of Adolf Hitler's four-year plan of 1936, and became an integral part of German industry during World War II. During the mid-1930s,

## 10 things made from lignite | Lignite Energy Council
February 25th, 2019. North Dakota is one of the country's top 10 coal-producing states. Approximately 30 million tons of lignite is mined regionally each year. Our lignite reserves contain an 800-year supply of economically recoverable coal at current usage. This coal is primarily used to generate electricity at seven coal-based power plants.

Consol was reorganized and reincorporated in Delaware as the Consolidation Coal Company, Inc. on November 1, 1935, and was able to retain its position as one of the nation's top coal producers. Eventually, stock control passed into the hands of the M.A. Hanna Company group of Cleveland, dealers in coal and iron ore.

## Lignite
Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.
