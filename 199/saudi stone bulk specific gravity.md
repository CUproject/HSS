Measure the increase in volume caused by the dry solids displacing some of the water. Assume the new volume is 550 c.c. The displacement, then, is 50 c.c. ().

## Specific Gravity and Bulk Density | SGS South Africa - SGSCorp
Nov 4, 2021"Specific gravity" is the density of a material relative to water. Since rocks are comprised of several distinct mineral phases, they do not have a fixed specific gravity. Instead, a rock's "bulk density" arises as a result of the percentage of all minerals in a sample multiplied by the specific gravity of each.

## What is the Difference Between Bulk Density and Specific Gravity
Feb 11, 2022The key difference between bulk density and specific gravity is that bulk density is a direct measurement, whereas specific gravity is a relative value.. Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. Specific gravity or relative density is the ratio between the density of a substance to the density of a given references material.
