## Rotary Kiln Maintenance - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Rotary Kiln Alignment. The continuity of operation of a lime sludge kiln requires strict maintenance control. The rotary kiln is among the largest type of moving machines made and is subjected to extreme temperatures, power failures, atmospheric conditions, varying loads, and other operating conditions which affect its wear and alignment

Cement Kilns Design features of rotary kilns. Design features of rotary cement kilns. The shell of the kiln is made of mild steel plate. Mild steel is the only viable material for the purpose, but presents the problem that the maximum temperature of the feed inside the kiln is over 1400 C, while the gas temperatures reach 1900 C.
