## Machinability of Cast Iron - Machining Doctor
Cast Iron is a group of Iron - Carbon-Silicone materials with 1.8-4% of Carbon (C) and 1-3% of Silicon (Si) content. The silicon pushes part of the carbon out of the solution, forming graphite flakes. The material is brittle at room temperature but has a low melting point and thus has excellent castability.

## The graphitization process of cast iron and the factors  - MINGHE
In order to obtain the required structure, the key is to control the degree of graphitization. Practice has proved that many factors such as the chemical composition of cast iron, the cooling rate of cast iron crystals, the overheating and standing of molten iron, etc., all affect graphitization and the microstructure of cast iron. 1.

The advantages of Iron Cast. Good casting properties (low Tm, good fluidity).It can be given any complex shape and size without using costly machining operations. Excellent anti-vibration (or damping) properties hence it is used to make machine frames. Constant Mechanical properties between 20 to 350 degree Celsius.

grey cast iron powder for producing the PM parts. Particle size distribution and chemical-physical proper-ties of the commercial pure iron powder are given in Tables 1 and 2. After preparation of the powders, mixtures of iron powder/jet-milled grey cast iron powder were prepared in proportions of 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, 60/40, and 70/30.

## End Mill recommendation for Cast Iron - Practical Machinist
I will be milling some Ductile Cast Iron, on a Bridgeport and looking for recommendations on the type of end mill to use. Approx size: 1/2" diameter by 1.5" cutting length. Will be doing side milling, so diameter is not of the greatest concern. On Niagras Website there chart recommends TiAIN or TiCN coating.

## cast iron powded by milling process
Jet milling proved to be a much more efficient process to make powder from gray cast iron scrap compared to ball milling 2 Jet milled powder in contrast to the ball milled powder, showed good compaction behavior in the as received condition and did not require any additional treatment before compaction such as annealing
