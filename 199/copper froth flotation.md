## Which ores are concentrated by froth flotation?
How is copper pyrite concentrated? Copper is mainly extracted from copper pyrites. After the concentration of its metal by froth flotation process, the metal is cooked in a current of air to eliminate arsenic, antimony and quite a bit of sulphur.  The ore being sulphide mineral is concentrated by foam floatation process.

Such ores containing multiple metals such as lead, copper and zinc can be selectively extracted by using froth floatation. The minerals that do not float into the froth are called the flotation tailings or flotation tails. The froth flotation process was first patented by H. F. K. Pickard, E. L.Sulman and John Ballot in the year 1906.

Copper is extracted from copper pyrites by froth flotation process. Froth flotation method is used to separate particles based on the differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively attach to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral-water slurry. A finely crushed ore is suspended in water and a blast of air is passed through the suspension.

## Cu-Pb Froth Flotation Guidance - Mining-pedia
May 24, 2022The froth flotation process is mainly used to separate non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel, gold, etc. In addition, froth flotation is suitable for the separation of fine particles that are difficult to recover by other beneficiation methods. Copper-lead ore has the characteristics of fine particle size and dense symbiosis of
