## Crushers: A Brief Guide to Crushers and Crushing Operations - Thomasnet
Types of Crushing Operation. Essentially, there are four types of crushing operations: shearing, compression, abrasion, and impact. Shearing is a cutting action that cleaves a workpiece between the edges of two surfaces. Compression involves squeezing with a workpiece between two opposing surfaces with increasing pressure until it breaks.
