## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining and Adaptive Practices for 
Limestone is a naturally formed mineral, primarily composed of calcium carbonate (Oates 2008).It forms commonly in shallow, calm and warm marine waters, as found in the Caribbean Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico (King 2005).Another way of limestone that forms is through evaporation, with this type of limestone growing in caves around the world (Critchfield 2017).

## Limestone Mining Processing
Limestone Mining Processing. 2 limestone quarrying and processing operations 21 limestone limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate with the occasional presence of magnesium most limestone is biochemical in origin meaning the calcium carbonate in the stone originated from shelled oceanic creatures limestone can also be chemical in origin.
