## wet ball mill process overview
The dry milling process may be used when the particle size of the powder is not required to be very fine or when the ball milled product is to be stored or sold in powder form. For example, in the production of cement, it is necessary to choose dry grinding instead of wet grinding, otherwise, it will be difficult to meet our needs.
