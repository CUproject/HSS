The crushing principle is different, so the materials processed by the counterattack and cone crushers are also different. Most impact crushers are designed to handle relatively soft stone (limestone). Cone crushers using compression crushing methods are mainly used for crushing hard raw materials such as granite, basalt and iron ore.
