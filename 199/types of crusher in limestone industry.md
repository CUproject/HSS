## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
There are two types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor and vertical shaft impactor. Impact crushers are suitable for materials that are soft or easily cleaving from the surface. The crusher consists of a fast spinning rotor and beaters attached to the rotor. The feed is entering to the crusher from the top and crushing starts

## Selecting the right type of crushing equipment - Quarry
Most crushers used for aggregate production can be categorised as one of three main types: Compression crushers - which squeeze the material until it breaks. Impact crushers - which use the principle of rapid impact to shatter material. A ttrition crushers - which use both impact and grinding to shear material.
