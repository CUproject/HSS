Jaw Crusher is widely used in industrial and mining enterprises, this is because the aircraft structure is relatively simple, and has a large range of models. Jaw Crusher is mainly used as the primary crusher. It can be used with mineral processing equipment, gravel ancillary equipment, it also can be used alone. Structure of Jaw Crusher is mainly include frame, eccentric shaft, big pulley

## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022A high-quality hammer crusher can keep final material 100% passing a twenty mesh, fifty to sixty percent passing a fifty-mesh screen. Crusher hammers are high chrome content. The hammer service life depends on the material you process. If you're running abrasive quartz, they'll last somewhere between one to two weeks.

For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material. A toggle plate and tension rods hold the pitman tight near the bottom of the moving swing jaw.
