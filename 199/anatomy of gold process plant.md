The evaporation of water molecules at the surface of the stomates in the leaves generates the sucking force that pulls the adjacent water molecules up to the leaf surface. Like a lengthy chain extending all the way back to the roots, each water molecule pulls up the molecule below it, and so the whole water column moves up the plant.
