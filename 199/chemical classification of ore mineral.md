## Classification of minerals - SlideShare
Classification of Minerals Of all the characters of minerals, the chemical constitution is the most fundamental, and it naturally takes an important position in any rational system of classification. Initially, grouping of minerals have been attempted according to their association in the field. (.Contd) 16.

Hydroxides are compounds of a metallic element and water or the hydroxyl anion (OH)-. The oxide minerals tend to be relatively hard, and some of them may be used as gemstones. Many provide economically important metal ores. Minerals of the hydroxide class tend to be softer and less dense than oxides.

## Characterization of Chemical Composition and Microstructure of Natural 
The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (south-western Uganda). The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production. Samples were taken from the six hills of Muko ore deposits and tests carried out to establish their composition and properties.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Aluminum. Aluminum is the most abundant metal element in the Earth's crust. Bauxite ore is the main source of aluminum and contains the aluminum minerals gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. Aluminum is used in the United States in packaging, transportation, and building. Because it is a mixture of minerals, bauxite itself is a rock, not a mineral.

Classification of minerals. Since the middle of the 19th century, minerals have been classified on the basis of their chemical composition.Under this scheme, they are divided into classes according to their dominant anion or anionic group (e.g., halides, oxides, and sulfides).Several reasons justify use of this criterion as the distinguishing factor at the highest level of mineral classification.

The simple oxides can be subdivided on the basis of the ratio of the numbers of atoms of metal (or other elements) and oxygen, giving general formulas of the A x O y type. In such formulas A represents a metal atom, and x and y represent integers. Chemical compositions then fall into categories such as those designated AO, A 2 O, A 2 O 3, AO 2.Specific simple oxide minerals include periclase
