Jun 30, 2022In 2018, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warned that sand mining of river deltas, such as the Yangtze and Mekong, is increasing the risk of climate-related disasters, because there's not enough sediment to protect against flooding. "Keeping sand in the rivers is the best adaptation to climate change," the WWF's Marc Goichot told the

## Everything You Need To Know About Sand And Aggregate Mining!
Each sand mining company processes sand which is ideal for construction purposes. Building of roads and manufacturing of concrete, all take place due to sand. The production of gravel deposits takes place by natural procedures like erosion and moisture. Gravel are of different types: ¾ " and 1 ½ ", seal, hydraulic base, and subbase.

Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts.

Construction of one mile of four-lane interstate highway requires 85,000 tons of aggregate; the average six room house requires 90 tons. "Aggregate" is any of several hard inert materials

## Environmental Impacts Of Mining Natural Aggregate | SpringerLink
The most obvious environmental impact of aggregate mining is the conversion of land use, most likely from undeveloped or agricultural land use, to a (temporary) hole in the ground. This major impact is accompanied by loss of habitat, noise, dust, blasting effects, erosion, sedimentation, and changes to the visual scene.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

By removing too much sediment from rivers, sand mining also leads to the erosion and shrinking of river banks. Deltas can recede due to sand mining. All of these destructive effects of sand mining ultimately lead to the loss of fertile land and property. It also destabilizes the ground and causes the failure of bridges, dikes, and roads.
