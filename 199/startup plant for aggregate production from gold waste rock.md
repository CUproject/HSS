waste rock dumps were typically constructed to a height of about 36 m by end-dumping over the crest of the dump. The waste rock types were selectively placed, based on their identified geology and inferred acid rock drainage potential. The final surface waste rock dump footprint covered about 340 ha and the dumps contain about 120 Mt of waste rock.

The body of a crustacean is composed of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the pereon or thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be fused together to form a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow.

Oct 6, 2020Swapping out taconite waste rock for gravel isn't straightforward. Nemanich explained that quality testing for bituminous (bitumen is the liquid binder that holds together asphalt) is based on the specific gravity of the aggregate material. Specific gravity defines how many cubic yards of asphalt can be made per ton of aggregate.
