## Are My Protective Styles Really Protecting?
The best way to wear your protective styles is without synthetic hair and after your hair has been treated. But, if you're feeling jazzy, you can add synthetic hair for color and length. Sanitizing the added hair and limiting the wear time to less than two months will give you better results once you take down the protective style.
