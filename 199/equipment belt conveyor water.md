## Belt Conveyor Systems | Handling Solutions Inc.
Belt Conveyor Systems. A belt conveyor system transports materials from one point to another. The system comprises two or more pulleys and a closed conveyor belt on a tight sleeve. A drive pulley causes the belt to rotate. A second pulley referred to as the idler or reversing pulley helps in changing the belt's direction of movement.

## Water Suppression to Control Belt Conveyor Dust Part 2 - Martin Eng
Excess water may promote belt slippage and belt mistracking, and it may increase the possibility of wet (hence, sticky) fines accumulating within chutes and around the transfer point. When applying water to materials on conveyor systems, a good axiom is "less is more." Different dust suppression systems add varying amounts of moisture.
