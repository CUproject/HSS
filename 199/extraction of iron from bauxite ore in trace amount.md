The term bauxite is used for naturally occurring mixtures of aluminium monohydrate. The bauxite used by the chemical and refractory industries in the United States in 1959 amounted to about 320,000 long dry tons. Bauxite is used mainly as an ore of aluminium and as raw material for the manufacture of aluminium chemicals.
