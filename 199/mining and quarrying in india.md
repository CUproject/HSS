## Quarrying - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coastal mining and quarrying are some of the major activities for removing sediments that cause an adverse impact on the diversity of coastal ecosystems (Kasperson and Kasperson, 2001; Kaliraj et al., 2014).Landsat ETM+ and OLI images were used to estimate the areal extent of sites encroached for mining and quarrying in the South Indian coastline.

## Livelihoods of marginal mining and quarrying households in India
Presenting an exploratory approach by which quantitative data from the National Sample Survey can be analysed to throw light on the most marginal households whose primary occupation is recorded as mining and quarrying, this paper finds that a large portion of mining and quarrying is carried out informally by marginal households from disadvantaged social groups.

Based on that assessment, we suggest that the mining industry risks losing an estimated $30 billion to $120 billion in EBITDA in 2020 versus 2019 because of the COVID-19 crisis, despite an expected revenue loss of $90 billion to $200 billion. We believe that the mining sector will remain relatively resilient and that part of the revenue loss
