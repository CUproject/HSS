## Lithium iron phosphate batteries: The future of EV technology?
Mar 15, 202115/03/2021. Forget lithium-ion. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for Electric Vehicles are rapidly speeding into our lives. Leading this charge appears to be Tesla, with Elon Musk indicating a shift of more of his EVs to LFP battery cells. He's increasingly betting on rechargeable battery technology that doesn't use cobalt or nickel.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Oct 6, 2021Epilithon contributes to phosphorus (P) cycling in lakes, but its P uptake traits have been rarely studied. We measured the chemical composition of epilithon and its inorganic P uptake kinetics using isotope 33P in three deep oligo- to mesotrophic post-mining lakes in April, July, and October 2019. Over the sampling period, epilithon biomass doubled, while the P content in biomass dropped to

Phosphorus fertilizer rates have, pretty generally, lagged crop removal for some time. As crops remove the soluble phosphorus in the soil, the soil's large reserve of less soluble forms will transfer some more phosphorus into the available "labile" pool.

Phosphorus moves in a cycle through rocks, water, soil and sediments and organisms. Here are the key steps of the phosphorus cycle. Over time, rain and weathering cause rocks to release phosphate ions and other minerals. This inorganic phosphate is then distributed in soils and water. Plants take up inorganic phosphate from the soil.
