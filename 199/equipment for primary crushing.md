The primary crusher is located in the quarry and consists of a McLanahan 48″x72′ Shale King Crusher rated at 1,000 TPH (Tons Per Hour). The driving flywheel has a diameter of 2.5 meters and is motor driven through six v-belts. The capacity of the primary crusher had to be increased to 1,250 TPH to produce enough material to serve the wet

Oct 27, 2020Figure 7. The jaw crusher stage with the normally expected operating conditions. A good rule of thumb for equipment capacity in a primary crusher stage is therefore to aim at 70-75% capacity utilization. This will normally give enough margin to handle the given uncertainties in operating conditions.
