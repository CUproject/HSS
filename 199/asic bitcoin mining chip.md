## Samsung to produce Bitcoin mining chips; Secures Chinese ASIC  - Finbold
Jun 30, 2022The 3nm chips are compatible with specific integrated circuits (ASICs), machines known to be effective in mining Bitcoin, with sources indicating trials are already underway, The Elec reported on June 29. Samsung's ability to manufacture 3nm chips will likely solve some Bitcoin mining pain points, like reducing power consumption by up to 30%.

## Selling the best ASIC chip for Bitcoin mining | Zeus Mining
1. The size variability of the ASIC allows the chip to be changed according to needs. 2. Due to its small physical size, relatively little electrical energy is used, and the ASIC only contains the circuits required by the application. Due to the small size and power consumption requirements, the efficiency of this section is higher.
