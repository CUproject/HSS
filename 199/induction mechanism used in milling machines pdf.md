## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Types, Operations (With PDF)
Milling Machine Definition. The milling machine is defined as perhaps most widely used in manufacturing industries after the lathe machine.. However, In the case of lathe machine tools, the tools used there single-point cutting tools but In the case of this machine, the tool used is multi-point cutting tools.. The milling is a process of metal-removing by feeding the workpiece passes through

## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Operation, Working Principle 
Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.
