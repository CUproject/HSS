## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate in Concrete
The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries. By replacement of quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity. The availability of sand at low cost as a fine aggregate in concrete is not suitable and

scarcity of natural sand is overcome by utilization of quarry dust, which can be called as manufactured sand. The use of manufactured sand in India has been low, when compared to the developed nation. Its an attempt to study the effect of partial replacement of fine aggregates by quarry dust and cement by fly ash on cement concrete.

## Study on The Replacement of Cement and Fine Aggregate With Quarry Dust
Quarry dust is the crusher waste of granite quarries which is about 13-15 % of the total quarry products and accumulation of this waste generates environmental issues. For the past three decades, the scarcity of river sand has been taken seriously.

Results showed that replacing 50% of fine aggregate with quarry dust gave a concrete with a maximum compressive strength of 25.10 N/mm2 on the 28th day of curing, when compared with all other replacement levels, including the control. Also, there was a significant decrease in workability as the percentage of quarry dust increased.
