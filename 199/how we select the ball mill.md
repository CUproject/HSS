## Ball Mills
Small and efficient. Ball Mills are the most effective laboratory mills for rapid batchwise comminution of medium-hard, soft, brittle, fibrous, temperature-sensitive and moist samples down to the finest particle size. The comminution of the material to be ground takes place through impact and friction between the grinding balls and the inside
