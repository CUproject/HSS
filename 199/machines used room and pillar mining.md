## Room and pillar mines, Mining Techniques, Underground Mining, Coal 
The room and pillar system is used in mining coal, iron and copper ores mainly when found as manto or blanket sediments, stone and aggregates, talc, soda ash and potash. The key to the winning room and pillar mining is opting the optimum pillar size. If the pillars are so small the mine will fall down. If the pillars are so big then significant

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
