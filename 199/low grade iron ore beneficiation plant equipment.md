## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

## Wet beneficiation of low grade iron ores, or tailings of 35-54% Fe 
The efficiency of iron recovery is 90-95% (as against 70-75% in the conventional beneficiation plants) & the left-over Fe in the tailings is only 10-15% (as against 35-45% in the conventional beneficiation plants). In the process, low grade iron ores are dry-ground, preferably to their liberation size & passed through a fluidized bed roaster.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500
