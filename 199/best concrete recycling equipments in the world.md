## Concrete Recycling | Concrete Disposal | Concrete Dumpster - Trash King
Since concrete is extremely heavy, it makes little sense to rent a full-sized 20- or 40-yard dumpster. They're not meant for hauling extremely heavy loads, and they cost more than smaller bins. Rock boxes are typically sized at 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, or 15 yards. Not all trucks can safely and legally carry 15-yard rock boxes.
