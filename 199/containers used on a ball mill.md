Batch Ball or Rod Mill Containers Materials . Feed size should generally be 1/8″ for ball mill and 1/2″ for rod mill They are of a sturdy rugged design to handle frequent use with hard materials The batch ball and rod mills require a drive roll to rotate the mill the proper grinding speed usually 60% 75%of the critical speed for ball mills and 50% to 90% of critical speed for rod mills

Not using enough milling media: Always fill your jar 50% full of grinding media. Using media that's too small: Use ½" for 1 gallon mill jars or smaller; ¾" for larger mill jars; for 5 gallons or larger, use 1-inch. Using lightweight grinding media: You want lead or brass. Both are heavy enough, but will not spark or cause an accidental
