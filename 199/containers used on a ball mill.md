Batch Ball or Rod Mill Containers Materials . Feed size should generally be 1/8â€³ for ball mill and 1/2â€³ for rod mill They are of a sturdy rugged design to handle frequent use with hard materials The batch ball and rod mills require a drive roll to rotate the mill the proper grinding speed usually 60% 75%of the critical speed for ball mills and 50% to 90% of critical speed for rod mills
