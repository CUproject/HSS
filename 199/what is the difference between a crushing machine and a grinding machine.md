## What is the Difference Between Turning, Drilling and  - JBC Machine
Drilling produces a round hole in a workpiece. A tapping or drill press machine performs drilling operations. However, drilling can also be handled with a milling machine. When machining a workpiece, chips are the waste material produced during the machining process. The way the drill bit is shaped enables chips to fall away from the workpiece.

## Lathe vs Milling Machine: 5 differences, why they matter
May 7, 2022The main difference between a lathe and a milling machine is the technique. With a lathe, the workpiece spins while the blade stays still. Whereas with a milling machine, the blade rotates and the workpiece stays still. You can also have a combination of lathe and milling machine. Here is my recent article about combo lathe and mill.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.
