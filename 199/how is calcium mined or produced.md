## Calcium Carbonate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Calcium carbonate is abundantly available in nature as limestone, chalkboard, or marble and CaCO 3 fillers from these minerals can be produced at very low cost. Three forms of CaCO 3 fillers are used; arranged in the order of purity, they are dry processed, beneficiated, and precipitated. Calcium carbonate is considered a soft, nonabrasive filler.
