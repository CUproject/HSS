## What Happens When Limestone Is Mixed With Water? - Yes Dirt
When the limestone, CaCO₃, is placed in the water, carbon dioxide (CO₂) bubbles form. That is because calcium ions (Ca²+) react with carbonate ions in limestone (CO₃²-) to create calcium carbonate (CaCo3). The equation for this reaction is: 2 Ca + 2 CO 3 ↔ CaCO 3 + CO 2 ↑+ heat.

## Gravel vs. Limestone | Hunker
Aug 31, 2021Both gravel and crushed limestone are often sold based on size. Sizing is classified as screenings, pea stones and stones . Screenings start from what's virtually sand through to 3/16 of an inch in diameter. Pea stones are what we would also consider pebbles, from 3/16 to 1/2-inch in diameter. Finally, "stones" are 1/2-inch through to 4 inches

## Common Uses For Limestone | What Can Lime Be Used For?
Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.
