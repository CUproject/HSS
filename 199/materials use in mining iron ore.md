## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron, which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Iron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.
