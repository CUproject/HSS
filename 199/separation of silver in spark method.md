## separation of silver in spark method
Silver has been known since ancient times. Silver is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC.The silver mines at Laurium were very rich and helped provide a currency for the economy of ancient Athens, where the process involved mining the ore in

Thread Pools. One of the ways that you can achieve parallelism in Spark without using Spark data frames is by using the multiprocessing library. The library provides a thread abstraction that you can use to create concurrent threads of execution. However, by default all of your code will run on the driver node.

The unique insolubility of silver chloride makes it possible to readily achieve a distinctive separation of silver from a mixed metal ion acidic solution. Using chloride precipitation with NaCl solution, the plant operation selectively removes all the silver from the pressure leach solution. The chemistry is quite straightforward and effective.

Option 1: using crude zinc as agent for desilvering during lead refining process. The silver-zinc crust is treated by continuous distillation to separate high purity zinc and Ag-Pb alloy. The high purity zinc is casted into ingot for sale. Ag-Pb alloy is further treated by discontinuous distillation to obtain lead bullion and crude silver.

PARTING: Separate Gold and Silver by Melting. Parting is the separation of silver from gold and a process during which the base metals are separated from both, but, as the presence of a high percentage of these base metals is injurious to the successful conduct of the processes which are chiefly in use, a preliminary refining by one of the methods already described is usually necessary.

## Generation of nanoparticles by spark discharge | SpringerLink
With the formula τ = (2 L / R) for our oscillator circuit we get R ≈ 5.1 Ω, if we regard the spark gap as a resistor in an RCL circuit. This indicates that during the oscillatory period we have a hot discharge of very low resistance, and this is consistent with the assumption of weak damping R < 2 ( L / C) 0.5.
