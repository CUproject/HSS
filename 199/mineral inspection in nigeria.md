## Drive shaft clunking noise when decelerating
Ans: A defective CV can sound like a loud click, popping, or clunks as the damage worsens. Frequent brake noise at low speed (caused by damage to the outer CV joints) makes grinding noises when making a tight turn at a low rate. A bad CV joint also causes a vibration felt in the steering wheel and floorboard of the car.
