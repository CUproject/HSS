Aggregate queries in peer-to-peer OLAP - A peer-to-peer (P2P) data management system consists essentially of a network of peer systems, each maintaining full autonomy over its own data resources. Data exchange between peers occurs when one of them, in the role of a local peer, needs data available in other nodes, denoted the acquaintances of the local peer.

This is a simple type of network where computers are able to communicate with one another and share what is on or attached to their computer with other users. It is also one of the easiest types of architectures to create

## aggregate quarry processing sensor networks
aggregate query processing in sensor networks. Sensor network applications rely heavily on aggregate queries. Queries are also considered a natural way for users to interact with the sensor network [23]. Therefore, several studies have been carried toward (aggregate) query processing in sensor networks [20,21,23].
