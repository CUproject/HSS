## Quartz Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. As a mineral name, quartz refers to a specific chemical compound (silicon dioxide, or silica, SiO 2 ), having a specific crystalline form (hexagonal). It is found is all forms of rock: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. Quartz is physically and chemically resistant to weathering.
