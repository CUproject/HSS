## How Can Urban Construction Cause Soil Erosion? - HSI Services
Sedimentation occurs when soil or sand particles gather at the bottom of a body of water. In urban settings, construction sites generally introduce large amounts of concrete and toxic building materials into an environment. When weather patterns carry these particles to nearby rivers, lakes, and streams, it can be destructive for society.
