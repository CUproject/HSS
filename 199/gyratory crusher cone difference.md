Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

Cone Crushers. Originally designed and developed by Symons (1920). Similar to gyratory except the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended. The head to depth ratio is larger than gyratory crushers. Cone angle are flatter and the slope of the mantle and concaves are parallel.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2).
