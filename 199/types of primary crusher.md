In any operation that incorporates size reduction, selecting the primary crusher is vital to the overall success. The main parameters to first decide on a general type of crusher are the impact strength, product size and material hardness. The final design for a crusher will be selected primarily based on required capacity, feed and product size.

Today, primary crushing is viewed as more important within the balance of production and proper sizing needs. The size and type of the primary crusher should be coordinated with the type of stone, drilling and blasting patterns, and the size of the loading machine. Most operations will use a gyratory, jaw or impact crusher for primary crushing.

The primary coal crushers may be of different types such as: (1) coal jaw, (2) coal hammer, and (3) ring granulator. Secondary coal crusher: Used when the coal coming from the supplier is large enough to be handled by a single crusher. The primary crusher converts the feed size to one that is acceptable to the secondary crusher.

## Clearing Blocked Crushers - Health and Safety Authority
Raw material of various sizes are brought to the primary crusher by rear-dump haul units, or carried by a wheel front-end loader. Primary crushing reduces excavated rock to a more manageable size. There are different types of primary secondary and tertiary crushers including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crushers, and autogenous crushers.
