Manganese is the 12th most abundant element in the earth's crust. According to the data released by USGS (United States Geological Survey), global manganese reserves are about 570 million tonnes (metal content) with land-based manganese resources distributing irregularly in 2014, and world manganese mine production was estimated to be 17 million tonnes in 2013.

## Manganese Processing | Equipment, Process Flow, Cases - JXSC
The density of manganese oxide ore is generally about 3.7~3.9t/m3, which is significantly different from silicate type gangue. Commonly used gravity separators include mineral jigs, shaker table, cyclones, chutes, and the like. The density of manganese carbonate ore is 3.3~3.6t/m3, which has a small difference from the density of gangue.
