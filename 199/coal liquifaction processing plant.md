## COAL UNDERGROUND LIQUEFACTION AS ALTERNATIVE TO NATURAL  - SpringerLink
The liquefaction of coal, which had been positioned as the strongest oil-alternative energy contender because of huge coal reserves, was undergoing development in many countries. Research in Germany, the United States and Japan involved pilot plants with the capacity to treat hundreds of tons of coal per day. A new approach was suggested by

## Coal Gasification and Liquefaction - Explained - Civils360 IAS
Feb 9, 2022The process involves gasification of coal, which in turn will produce synthetic gas (a mix of CO+H2). The synthetic gas can be liquefied to its fuel equivalent in presence of cobalt/iron-based catalysts at higher pressure and temperature. However, liquefied coal emits twice as much CO2 as burning oil. It also emits a large volume of SO2.

Naturally, liquefaction is advantageous as it can be transported or stored to a greater quantity. LNG Process is the process of liquefaction. The process of cooling the gaseous LNG to -259°F or -162°C for transforming it into liquid is known as LNG Process. The process is actually a chain of methods, hence popularly known as LNG Process Chain.

Coal liquefaction is a process of converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons: liquid fuels and petrochemicals. This process is often known as "Coal to X" or "Carbon to X", where X can be many different hydrocarbon-based products.  This led to the construction of twelve DCL plants using hydrogenation and nine ICL plants using Fischer-Tropsch

Therefore, conversion of coal into liquid fuels involves the addition of hydrogen. Hydrogenation of coal can be done directly, either from
