An attempt has been made to durability studies on green concrete compared with the natural sand concrete. It is found that the compressive, split tensile strength and durability studies of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 14 % more than the conventional concrete. The concrete resistance to sulphate attack was enhanced greatly.
