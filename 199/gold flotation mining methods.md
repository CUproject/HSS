More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's

Flotation is also used for the removal of interfering impurities before hydrometallurgical treatment, for upgrading of low sulfide and refractory ores for further treatment. Flotation is considered to be the most cost-effective method for concentrating gold. Flotation process maximizes the enrichment of gold into sulfide minerals.

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Pre-19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthur-Forrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
