How can we improve the quality of coal? (1) Improve Heat Rates The higher the ash content of coal, the lower the heating value of that coal . By removing the ash through washing, the coal's heating value can be improved dramatically . This means that less coal must be burned to produce a comparable amount of electricity .

Although the biochar yield dropped by 11.9-32.9%, significant improvement in its quality was indicated by lower H/C and O/C ratios and higher calorific value of 27.5-30.5 MJ/kg, which is at par with coal. Non-condensable gas yields dropped post pretreatment of biomass, signifying a favorable shift to prodn. of bio-oil.

Calorific Value. The calorific value of coal is measured for almost all coal samples. It is a measure of the heating ability of a coal and is needed to estimate the amount of coal needed to produce a desired amount of heat. Calorific values are also used to define coal rank in low- and medium-rank coals below the rank of medium-volatile

## Calorific Value - Definition, Calculating Method, Formula and  - VEDANTU
The calorific value defines the energetic content of the materials; it is the amount of heat a substance produces after complete combustion. You can express it as the gross calorific value (GCV) or high heating value. Also, the calorific value of a substance (generally, solid biofuel or food) is the specific energy of combustion for a unit mass.
