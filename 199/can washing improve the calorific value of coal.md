How can we improve the quality of coal? (1) Improve Heat Rates The higher the ash content of coal, the lower the heating value of that coal . By removing the ash through washing, the coal's heating value can be improved dramatically . This means that less coal must be burned to produce a comparable amount of electricity .

Although the biochar yield dropped by 11.9-32.9%, significant improvement in its quality was indicated by lower H/C and O/C ratios and higher calorific value of 27.5-30.5 MJ/kg, which is at par with coal. Non-condensable gas yields dropped post pretreatment of biomass, signifying a favorable shift to prodn. of bio-oil.

As proven with petrol / LPG engines, being a clean, total burn fuel, the LPG actually seems to clean the engine, thus prolonging it's life. The location of the tank is basically any space where it will. Our Fuel Conversion Calculator will help you to compare the price of using LPG or Natural Gas over other fuels such as High Speed Diesel (HSD), Light Diesel Oil (LDO) and Furnace Oil (FO).

Calorific Value. The calorific value of coal is measured for almost all coal samples. It is a measure of the heating ability of a coal and is needed to estimate the amount of coal needed to produce a desired amount of heat. Calorific values are also used to define coal rank in low- and medium-rank coals below the rank of medium-volatile

## Calorific Value - Definition, Calculating Method, Formula and  - VEDANTU
The calorific value defines the energetic content of the materials; it is the amount of heat a substance produces after complete combustion. You can express it as the gross calorific value (GCV) or high heating value. Also, the calorific value of a substance (generally, solid biofuel or food) is the specific energy of combustion for a unit mass.
