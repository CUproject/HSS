## cassiterite is an ore
Cassiterite, also called tinstone, heavy, metallic, hard tin dioxide (SnO 2) that is the major ore of tin. It is colourless when pure, but brown or black when iron impurities are present. Commercially important quantities occur in placer deposits, but cassiterite also occurs in granite and pegmatites.

## Cassiterite Flotation - Tin Oxide - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
When it comes to flotation of a Tin rich ore like cassiterite, collector is a most important reagent as it determines froth grade and recovery. The optimum addition is controlled by several factors; ore type, head grade, product grade and recovery. The collectors used in cassiterite flotation often have an effect on the froth properties.

The cassiterite is formed by hydrothermal process and occurs as veins, alluvial, and placer. The grains are resistant to weathering. Cassiterite contains 78.6% Sn and are the principle tin ore throughout ancient history and remains the primary source of tin metal, used as plates, cans, containers, solders, and polishing compounds and alloys.

Which metal is extracted from cassiterite? Explanation: The metal extracted from cassiterite is tin SnO(_2).. How is tin manufactured? Production of Tin Tin is most often produced from the mineral cassiterite, which is made up of about 80% tin. Tin is smelted at temperatures of up to 2500°F (1370°C) with carbon to produce low purity tin and CO 2 gas.
