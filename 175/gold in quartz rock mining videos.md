## Quartz Mining and Extraction | Quartz Mining Processing
Physical processing: the physical process involves cleaning the surface of the quartz. In magnetic separation and high tension separation the minerals and quartz are separated depending on the surface charge. Chemical processing: floatation and acid leaching are the two primary processes in which the trace minerals from the quartz are removed.

Fortunately, at-home testing isn't hard. You have three basic methods at your disposal: Magnetic Testing- Touch a magnet to the specimen. Pyrite is magnetic, gold isn't. Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.

## Garden of Edene-barssel
A 25-minute hike down an old mining trail (or faster by trailblazing) is the South Yuba River with stunning swimming holes, secluded beaches, hidden campsites, and great fishing for wild trout. Throughout the area, Gold Rush history is present almost everywhere with old flume beds, mine shafts, quartz pieces, rusty old equipment, square nails.

## How to find gold in quartz rock specimens - Gold Rush Nuggets
Check the tailing piles and waste rock near the entrance of mine openings. Remember that gold miners didn't have metal detectors hundreds of years ago, so it was easy to overlook gold that was peeking out of a piece of quartz. Another interesting thing to consider is that back then it took a lot of gold to be worth the effort to process.
