## Iron Ore Sinter - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Low-temperature (< 1300 °C) iron ore sinter is an agglomerate of unmelted and partially melted nuclei particles (+  Sintering and pelletizing are two common agglomeration processes. In a BF, pig iron and blast furnace gas (BFG) is produced by reducing iron ore sinters and pellets with coal and coke. BFG is partly used for other processes

What are steel pellets used for? Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing.The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the United States.

## are iron ore pellets and sinter agglomerated
2.2 Comparing Sinter and Pellets Sinter and pellets are agglomerated forms of iron ore, both suitable for use as blast furnace burden materials. The principle difference between sinter and pellets arises from the type of raw materials used in their preparation and the nature of the sinter and pelletizing agglomeration processes.
