## Anaerobic Digestion: Turning Waste Into Energy | Dumpsters
An anaerobic digester is where the anaerobic digestion process takes place. It is a sealed, metal, oxygen-free tank, often resembling a silo. While the waste breaks down, the digester collects the resulting biogas in balloon-like "caps.". As pressure builds up, the biogas is forced out of the caps into generators where it's converted into
