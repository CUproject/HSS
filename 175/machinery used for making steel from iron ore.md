## Steelmaking
Steelmaking has played a crucial role in the development of ancient, medieval, and modern technological societies. Early processes of steel making were made during the classical era in Ancient Iran, Ancient China, India, and Rome.. Cast iron is a hard, brittle material that is difficult to work, whereas steel is malleable, relatively easily formed and a versatile material.

## How Does Mining Equipment Work in Iron Ore Mining?
Iron ore mining shapes the world. The raw ferrous deposits are extracted and transformed into structural steel, machine housings, case hardened gears and countless other important products. Without iron alloys, contemporary buildings couldn't rise towards the sky, nor could heavy-duty equipment support the massive loads that iron girders manage every working day. Given those facts,

## Iron Ore Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being
