In gold placer mining, in which minute specks of gold are washed from sand or gravel deposits, mercury was often used to separate the gold from other heavy minerals. After all of the practical metal had been taken out from the ore, the mercury was dispensed down a long copper trough, which formed a thin coating of mercury on the exterior.

## Help separating gold front iron ore
All, Appreciate the comments! I used Chapman's flux. My understanding is that it is useful for separating iron from gold. Seems to oxidize the iron pretty well, but not well enough I suspect. I increased the amount of borax to 4 times original proportions. Did a really good job reducing viscosity of the melt.

Particles that are the easiest to separate are large (100 microns vs. 5 microns) and highly magnetic (for example, iron and low-alloy steel). The fluid conditions that best facilitate the separation of magnetic particles are low oil viscosity (ISO VG 32 vs. ISO VG 320 for instance) and low oil flow rate (2 GPM vs. 50 GPM).
