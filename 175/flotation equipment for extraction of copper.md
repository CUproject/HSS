## Gold Extraction Process Methods Summary - JXSC Machine
In this paper, I will detail the methods of the gold extraction process, including gravity separation, flotation, cyanidation, and amalgamation.. The content of gold in the ore is extremely low. In order to extract gold, we need to crush the large ore rock into small pieces first, grind it, and then use appropriate gold processing methods to separate the gold from the ore, get the gold

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill

Jul 27, 2021Froth flotation is a method of separating ores using the difference in physical and chemical properties of mineral surfaces. It is currently the main method for the flotation of copper oxide. Relatively speaking, froth flotation can be used to separate malachite and azurite. However, chrysocolla and copper phosphate are difficult to float.
