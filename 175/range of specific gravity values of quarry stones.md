Heft: Specific gravity can be related to the heft as well as the size of a gemstone. Some gemstones are 'heavier1 than others i.e. they have more heft. This method of sensing the S.G. of a gem, is of course very crude, but is sometimes of value when making a quick subjective assessment of a stone.

specific gravity, also called relative density, ratio of the density of a substance to that of a standard substance. The usual standard of comparison for solids and liquids is water at 4 °C (39.2 °F), which has a density of 1.0 kg per litre (62.4 pounds per cubic foot). Gases are commonly compared with dry air, which has a density of 1.29 grams per litre (1.29 ounces per cubic foot) under so

## Specific Gravity of Fine Aggregate as per IS 2386 Part-3 (1963 
The specific gravity of fine aggregate (sand) is considered to be around 2.65 to 2.67. Sand particles composed of quartz have a specific gravity between 2.65 to 2.67. While inorganic clays generally range from 2.70 to 2.80. Soils with large amounts of organic matter or porous particles (such as diatomaceous earth) have specific gravity below 2.

##  Mineral Appraisals: What is the Value of a Quarry or Mine?
The specific gravity is a number that expresses the ratio between a material's weight and the weight of an equal volume of water. A limestone that has a specific gravity of 2.65 is 2.65 times heavier than an equal volume of water. A diabase that has a specific gravity of 2.95 is 2.95 times heavier than an equal volume of water.
