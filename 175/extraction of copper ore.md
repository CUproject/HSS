## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores

## Extraction of Copper from Copper-Bearing Materials by Sulfation 
Recycling metals from secondary materials and more complex ores has recently been attracting more attention, creating a need for more precise separation methods of different elements. This study proposed a sulfation-roasting method and designed thermodynamic conditions to selectively facilitate the formation of copper sulfate while separating iron as oxide. The roasting behaviors for

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

May 30, 2022The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulphides. The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Why is the extraction of copper from pyrites more difficult than that 
The Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ f G) of Cu 2 S is less than that of H 2 S and CS 2.Therefore, H 2 and C cannot reduce Cu 2 S to Cu.. On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy of formation of Cu 2 O is greater than that of CO. Hence, C can reduce Cu 2 O to Cu.. C (s) +Cu 2 O (s) → 2Cu (s) + CO (g). Hence, the extraction of copper from its pyrite ore is difficult than from its oxide ore

## What are the reasons extraction of pure copper is expensive?
Answer (1 of 2): Several factors that have high impact on cost.  Low percentage of copper in ores requires a lot of rock to be moved and processed   In the 21st century, average Cu content in ore is less than 0.6 % ; to yield 1 ton of copper requires digging and trucking and processing 18
