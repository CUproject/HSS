## Getting past the rebar - Recycling Product News
For Spence, concrete chunks were being pre-broken by an excavator mounted pulverizer with a 36-inch Moley Magnetics magnet, to get the majority of rebar out. But a lot of rebar was still going through the 4043 T crusher, which was presenting a challenge. Every once in a while, a piece of rebar or steel would become stuck in the rubber conveyor

Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.

## Impact Crushers Concrete With Rebar
Nov 23, 2012 While jaw crushers use pressure to break up concrete, impact crushers rely on impact (as their name implies). Some impact crushers throw the rock against hard surfaces with such velocity that the rocks naturally break along internal fissures. Other impact crushers use hammers on the outer edge of a spinning rotor to break up materials.
