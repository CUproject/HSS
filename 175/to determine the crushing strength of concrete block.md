Computation of Compressive Strength of the Sandcrete Blocks. In obtaining the compressive strength of the sandcrete blocks in N/mm 2 the crushing loads recorded were divided by the effective area of the block. Equation 1 was used in calculating the compressive strength and Equation 2 gives the effective surface area of the sandcrete block.

## To Determine Crushing Strength of given Aggregate- Concrete Practical
Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag, used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar. Coarse Aggregate Those particles that are predominantly retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve, are called Coarse Aggregates.
