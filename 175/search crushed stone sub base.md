## Your crushed stone supplier of choice: Analiza Boerdery
Crushed stone (also known as angular rock) consists of suitable rock deposits that have been broken down to a desirable size with the use of crushers. It differs from gravel due to the fact that it is produced by breaking down rocks artificially, whereas gravel is formed by a natural erosion or weathering processes, which in turn results in the stone having a rounder shape.

What is an Artificial Grass Sub-base? Within the fake grass industry, the 'artificial grass base' is known as the layer of crushed stone- often a combination of Type 1/MOT (50-70mm) and Granite Dust (20-30mm)- which is installed on top of the original ground before installing the artificial grass.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.

## Pea gravel or crushed rock? Community Forums
The rigidity of crushed stone makes it an ideal base material to support concrete if you have cracking concerns. But don't be fooled. Your concrete will crack, guaranteed. But a good rigid and compacted base will keep the individual mini-continents from shifting. The concrete doesn't need to adhere to the stone base, there is no advantage to that.

Jul 7, 2021Step 2 - Add the Sub-Base Material. Once the ground is fairly solid, you can start adding the sub base material. The composition of this material may vary depending on your preference and/or geological location; limestone (or sandstone) is commonly used. Having a good mix of large and fine particles is recommended for successful compaction.

The minimum depth of the crushed stone base is 4". Typical thickness range is 4" - 6". Crushed stone base layers thicker than 6" are more challenging to achieve the necessary 95% compaction rate throughout the base.  Crushed stone is not an acceptable sub-base for any mounded area. In these areas, the stone would need to be skim
