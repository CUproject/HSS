## Ammonium Sulphate Suppliers, CAS No. - Chemtradeasia
Ammonium sulphate is prepared by treating ammonia with sulphuric acid. The chemical reaction is written as: 2 NH 3 + H 2 SO 4 → (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Another method of preparing ammonium sulphate is adding gypsum salt to an ammonium carbonate solution. Calcium carbonate and ammonium sulphate are the products of the reaction.

##  TECHNICAL REPORT q MANUFACTURE OF AMMONIUM SULFATE FERTILIZER FROM FGD 
SE-ME to obtain process engineering data for the manufacture of ammonium sulfate from FGD-gypsum and to help evaluate technical and economic feasibility of the process. Controlled greenhouse experiments will be conducted at UIUC to evaluate the chemical impact of coal-derived impurities in ammonium sulfate produced from FGD-gypsum.
