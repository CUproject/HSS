A blast furnace is a device or a structure that uses a blast of hot air enriched with oxygen to provide high temperatures.  Zone of slag formation takes place at a height of 20m from the base of the blast furnace. The temperature here is about 12000K - 1500K.

The formation of Ti(C, N) occurs principally on the interfacial reac- tions between slag and coke as well as between slag and liquid iron in the blast fur- nace.

A blast furnace is a block that smelts ores, raw metals, iron and gold armor and tools, similar to a furnace. A blast furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 100 game ticks (5 seconds) or twelve items per minute, which is twice as fast as a standard furnace. It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it

## Blast Furnace: Introduction, Definition, Construction, Working 
A blast furnace is a special type of cylindrical furnace, which is basically used for the purpose of smelting. So, the industrial metals can be extracted from their ores like iron, pig iron, or copper. The word 'blast' gives the idea of combustion air which is forcefully supplied or produced to the atmospheric pressure above.

## blast furnace | Definition, Temperature, Diagrams, & Facts
Blast furnaces produce pig iron from iron ore by the reducing action of carbon (supplied as coke) at a high temperature in the presence of a fluxing agent such as limestone.Ironmaking blast furnaces consist of several zones: a crucible-shaped hearth at the bottom of the furnace; an intermediate zone called a bosh between the hearth and the stack; a vertical shaft (the stack) that extends from
