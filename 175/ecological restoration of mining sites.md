Abstract. This paper reviews the ecological aspects of mined soil restoration, with special emphasis on maintaining a long-term sustainable vegetation on toxic metal mine sites. The metal mined soils are man-made habitats which are very unstable and will become sources of air and water pollution. Establishment of a vegetation cover is essential

## Restoration and renewal of ecological spatial network in mining cities 
In mining cities, the original landscape space becomes fragmented due to the extraction of resources, and the broken source sites are connected through ecological corridors to gradually achieve the restoration of urban landscape functions, which is a type of urban landscape space beautification process.

## Adopting novel ecosystems as suitable  - Ecological Processes
The nature and extent of environmental disturbance associated with mining commonly entails completely new and challenging combinations of climate, lithology and landform. Consequently, the outcomes of ecological processes associated with the recovery or restoration of ecosystems cannot be predicted reliably from previously known associations between their physical and biological components.

## Frontiers | Mangrove Rehabilitation and Restoration as Experimental 
Rehabilitated and restored mangrove ecosystems have important ecological, economic, and social values for coastal communities. Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges.
