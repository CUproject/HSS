## Rock Iron Art | Home
Rock Iron Art, is the syntheses of a life long love affair that sculptor Albert Belleveau has had with two of northern Minnesota's most plentiful resources. He uses rocks and metal in sculptural form to depict humorous life forms, unique functional furniture and decorating accouterments.

## Iron produced from thermite reaction - Metallurgy - I Forge Iron
If you only use ore ad Al-powder the iron will be fairly pure Fe, no carbon at all. Grainsize is HUGE and there will be lots of cracks wich makes it a bit tricky to forge in the begining alloying elements can be added in the process to make instant steel, but it is quite hard to control exact composition of the steel.

## Everything You Need To Know About Iron Absorption & How Iron Is 
Vitamin C rich foods such as oranges, bell peppers, and lemons as well as supplemental vitamin C can aid iron absorption. Absorption of iron can also be reduced by the other foods that you consume. For example, one boiled egg can reduce absorption of iron in a meal by as much as 28%. This 'egg factor' is caused by the phosphoprotein in eggs

Banded iron formation (BIF) is both the most easily identifiable of all sedimentary rocks and the one whose origin is most enigmatic. Its flamboyant mesoscale banding is defined by planar variations in the proportions of the two main mineral components - quartz and iron oxides - each of which forms about half of the mass of the rock.

Heme iron is found in meat, fish and poultry. It is the form of iron that is most readily absorbed by your body. You absorb up to 30 percent of the heme iron that you consume. Eating meat generally boosts your iron levels far more than eating non-heme iron. Non-heme iron is found in plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables and nuts.

## Iron Absorption - Bodytomy
Absorption of iron in the human body takes place through the digestive tract (the small intestine). The remaining organs of the digestive system contribute their bit to breaking down of food matter. However, the important part comes when the iron from the food source gets assimilated into the blood flow and into the hemoglobin.

Increased isotopic fractionation is attributed in this case to the fact that as bacterial respiration depletes the system in oxygen and aqueous Fe is reduced, equilibration between aqueous ferrous and ferric iron creates a pool of isotopically heavy ferric iron that is assimilated by bacterial cells.

Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.
