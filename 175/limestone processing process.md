## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The limestone also requires less processing and does not undergo calcination, so it releases less waste in its production. The resulting cement will perform at least as well as cements that do not contain limestone. The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of

## What is the limestone's mining process? - Quora
Answer: Limestone deposits are found throughout the world. They are "mined" in a process known as "quarrying." This process varies depending on the use of the product. If it is to be made into cement, it is needed in small pieces so that it can be ground and calcined. In this case, the rock has h
