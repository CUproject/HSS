## Azurite Value, Price, and Jewelry Information
Since azurite is more unstable than malachite, it often pseudomorphs into malachite. This means its chemistry changes to malachite while retaining azurite's external crystal form. Azurite's distinctive, intense blue color makes it a popular collector's stone. However, even small azurites are extremely dark, virtually black.
