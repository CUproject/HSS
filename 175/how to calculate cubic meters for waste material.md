## How many square meters is one cubic meter? - Wise-Answer
How many cubic feet are in a square meter? We can find that there are 35.314 square feet per meter either by looking it up on a table such as here, or we can work it out by hand: 3.2808 feet per meter. 3.2808 ft x 3.2808 ft x 3.2808 ft = 35.314 cubic feet. So, to convert you would multiply the cubic meters by 35.314 to give you cubic feet.
