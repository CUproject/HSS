## Gold extraction
A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. These refractory ores require pre-treatment in order for cyanidation to be effective in recovery of the gold.

Jan 20, 2022The development of oxidation roasting technologies has improved the market prospects of dealing with gold ore and other refractory ores despite the problems of over-roasting and under-roasting. Oxidation roasting, followed by leaching, is considered as the optimum method to treat carbonaceous gold ore. In the two-stage roasting process

May 25, 2022Complex ores have higher reagent consumptions, and require more intricate processing circuits and potentially alternative lixiviants to cyanide for economic processing. Refractory ores have similar challenges but also require an additional stage (ultrafine<br>grinding or sulfide oxidation) to achieve sastisfactory recoveries.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

Gold's resistance to oxidation is a critical point of most refining and extraction methods, and the roasting process is no exception.

## Gold Ore Roasting Plant - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
At Cortez Gold Mines in Nevada, the first Lurgi CFB roaster for whole ore roasting has been installed for calcining 90 st/h of gold bearing refractory ore. The ore contains 1.1% sulfide sulfur, 1.1% organic carbon and 2.9% carbonate carbon on average. The limestone introduced to the process with the ore reacts with the SO2 forming gypsum.

##  The Leachox™ Refractory Gold Process - The Testing, Design 
The Leachox refractory gold process has to date been applied to the selectivetreatment of several refractory gold ores but on a relatively small scale. In this paper the successful implementation of the process, from initial testing through to commissioning at one of the world's largest refractory gold mines is described.
