## Drilling Into Granite Rock - What You Need To Know - Go Improve Home
Drilling into granite rock is a difficult task. The first step is to use a hammer drill to create a hole in the rock. Once the hole is created, you can use a regular drill to finish the job. Make sure to use a drill bit that is designed for granite. Regular drill bits will not be able to penetrate the rock.

## How Are Granite and Marble Countertops Made? | Marble
Polishers grind down the naturally rough surface of the stone to whatever finish the consumer desires. Hard stones like marble and granite can be polished all the way to a mirror finish. The polisher consists of rotating pads which are surfaced with an abrasive substance. The finer and smaller the abrasive grits are, the higher the polish.

The first cut is made with a large gang saw. The blade on the saw have segments with tough edges that are able to create the amount of fiction necessary to cut the granite blocks into slabs. To keep the saw from overheating, water is consistently poured over the blades. The process of cutting granite is quite slow.
