Our drum filter is the first choice for large ponds which require excellent filter performance, as well as for industrial requirements. We are streets ahead! Basically, it boils down to microfiltration - the separation of liquid and solid components in a micrometer range. In the specific case of fish farming - the separation of water and plant particles as well as other impurities.
