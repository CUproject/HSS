## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone did not become a staple in construction until after WW2 for a simple reason: The equipment did not exist to crush or move stone efficiently. Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed.
