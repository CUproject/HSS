## Bauxite Mining and Alumina Refining - LWW
The bauxite ore contains aluminum trihydrate (Al(OH) 3). Alumina refining produces alumina (Al 2 O 3) from the bauxite ore, by exploiting the reversible reaction of the Bayer process 1-3: The reaction is firstly driven in the sodium aluminate (NaAlO 2) direction by the addition of caustic soda (NaOH) to bauxite. Bauxite residues are then

Bayer Process. The second step is known as the Bayer process, which involves a combination of a chemical extraction and a mechanical separation to extract alumina (the base from of aluminium) from the bauxite. In the first step of the process, the alumina is released from the bauxite when it is crushed and dissolved in sodium hydroxide.

## During extraction of aluminium from bauxite?
What ore is aluminium extracted from? Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite. First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.

Bauxite, the principal ore used for aluminum smelting, is named after Les Baux, Provence, the village where the first deposits were discovered. Bauxite contains hydrated alumina equivalent to as much as 40-60% Al 2 O 3, and is free of the other siliceous materials leached out over time. However it still contains 10-30% iron oxide, and some

## During extraction of aluminium from bauxite?f
What ore is aluminium extracted from? Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite. First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.

## Energy needed to produce aluminum
Bauxite is then converted into aluminum oxide, or alumina, using natural gas at plants located in the southern United States. After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum. In this process, alumina is dissolved in a solution and a strong electric current is applied.

## Alumina Limited
Also, for each tonne of alumina produced approximately 2 tonnes of bauxite residue results. The goal is to reduce bauxite residue land requirements per unit of alumina by 15% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 and recycle or reuse 15% of residue generated by 2020 and 30% by 2030.

## Alcoa to design an alumina refinery of the future
Nov 9, 2021Bauxite Residue: reduce and reuse We extract, process, and refine the most recyclable metal on earth. And the aluminum we produce plays a key role in meeting the needs of a sustainable society. Currently, bauxite residue, a by-product of the alumina refining process, requires land and other resources to manage.
