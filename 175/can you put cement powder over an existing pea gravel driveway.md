Get some cement, not sand mix or concrete . Take it dry and rake it in with the pea gravel, you dont want too much cement sitting on top . Take a sprinkler and wet it down, it will tighten it up, still be looser stones on top. I was thinking something like this might work. Stiffin it up a bit so it's not so loose.

## Can I "just" concrete over the existing gravel in this carport?
Undisturbed gravel with compacted sand for extra drainage or leveling would work great. Top soil makes a poor base since living matter can be compressed, so it is removed and made up with road-gravel or sand. Since you have a base that is not top soil and has been compacted by cars and settled for years you don't have that problem.
