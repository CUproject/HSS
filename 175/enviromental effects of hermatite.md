Specifically with lead, if released into the environment can cause damage to human blood, kidneys, as well as central and peripheral nervous systems. When e-waste is warmed up, toxic chemicals are released into the air damaging the atmosphere. The damage to the atmosphere is one of the biggest environmental impacts from e-waste.

## Hematite: Meaning, Healing Properties and Powers
Hematite is a grounding stone that is mostly used for protection and stability. The word "hematite" is derived from a Greek word that means "blood." As a result, it is known as the "bloodstone" and has been employed as a talisman against excessive blood flow. Hematite is a kind of iron ore that is made up of iron oxide crystals.
