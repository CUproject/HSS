## Mortar Mix Ratio Proportioning for Masonry Construction
Reading time: 4 minutes. Mortar mix ratio i.e. proportioning of cement sand in mortar provides consistency in the performance and appearance of masonry construction. Proper proportioning of mortar ingredients helps in having the following advantages: Uniformity of strength. Uniform workability. Uniform color. Uniformity of proportions and yields.

Mixture proportioning refers to selection of the proper amount of ingredients to make a batch of concrete. Selecting concrete proportions involves a balance between economy and requirements for placeability, strength, durability, density, and appearance. The required characteristics are governed by how the concrete will be used and by conditions expected to be encountered at the time of placement.

## Understanding Concrete Mix Ratios | All Mixes for All Concrete Projects
Let's use this in an example, for M5 concrete, the mixing proportion would be 1: (cement) 5: (sand) 1: (coarse) 0: (aggregates). The mix will always consist of cement, sand, water and aggregates. Base Concrete provide a helpful table that outlines all concrete mix ratios: Concrete Grade. Mix Ratio (cement : sand : aggregates)

## Influence of Pore Structure on Compressive Strength of Cement Mortar
2.1. Experimental Materials and Mix Proportions. Ordinary Portland cement (ASTM Type I) without mineral additions was used as binder. In this work, 24 mix proportions cement mortar with the w/c of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 were prepared. The fine aggregate was manufactured sand consisting mainly of calcium carbonate and natural river sand composed mostly of quarts.
