## The working principle of jaw crusher - Mining Mobile Crushers and 
Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.

## Jaw crusher working principle and application - Term Papers - Greatwallmill
Working Principle of jaw crusher: The belt and belt pulley are driven by a motor, and the movable jaw moves up and down via eccentric shaft. The angle between fixed jaw and movable jaw becomes smaller when the movable jaw runs down, then the materials are crushed into pieces, it becomes bigger when the movable jaw runs up.
