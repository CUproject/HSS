The ball-milling tables can operate multiple jars at the same time as the jars' rotation is induced by continuous rotation of the table's rollers. Ball mill is typically used to grind and/or blend materials and it can be done wet or dry. It can be used to mix ceramic powders, disperse particles in solvents, homogenize ceramic slurries, etc
