## Landslide | National Geographic Society
Jul 15, 2022A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. Landslides are caused by rain, earthquakes, volcanoes, or other factors that make the slope unstable. Geologists, scientists who study the physical formations of the Earth, sometimes describe landslides as one type of mass wasting.A mass wasting is any downward movement in which the Earth's surface is worn away.

Hence, understanding the landslide process and susceptibility zonation of this watershed will be a step forward to identify and implement measures to control landslide and soil erosion processes and reduce disaster risk in the Hi-malayas. The findings of this study can be replicated to similar geo-ecological conditions elsewhere.

Landslide processes in Moscow are well investigated. Landslides cover about 3% of the city, where there are 15 deep and a lot of small landslides, and the landslide hazard is mapped. In the last few years in Moscow, there is a significant activation of landslide processes. To assess the landslide hazard, the height of the slope, the landslide

## What is a landslide and what causes one? | U.S. Geological Survey
A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The term "landslide" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. These are further subdivided by the type of geologic material

Landslide Dams : Processes, Risk, and Mitigation. Landslide dams have proved to be both interesting natural phenomena and significant hazards in many areas of the world. A few of these blockages attain heights and volumes that rival or exceed the world's largest man-made dams. Because landslide dams are natural phenomena, they are vulnerable to failure by overtopping and breaching.
