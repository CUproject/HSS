## 139 to increase the concentration of copper in an ore
See Page 1. 139.To increase the concentration of copper in an ore, it must be crushed to a very fine size and then beneficiated to remove the gangue minerals. Because sulfide minerals are hydrophobic and most silicate minerals (gangue) are hydrophilic a process calledfroth flotationis used to concentrate the chalcopyrite.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

Once copper has been concentrated, it can be turned into pure copper cathode in two different ways: leaching & electrowinning or smelting and electr olytic refining. Oxide ore and tailings are leached by a weak ac id solution, producing a weak copper sulfate solution.

In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.
