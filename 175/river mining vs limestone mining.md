## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.
