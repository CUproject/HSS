## Galena: The mineral galena information and pictures
Galena is by far the greatest ore of lead. The extraction process to remove the lead from the sulfur is very simple, thus lead has been extracted from Galena since the earliest times. Galena from certain regions is rich in silver, and some specimens may contain as much as 20 percent silver. Because of this, silver-rich Galena is also an ore of silver. . Another use of Galena was its importance

## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Even though more than 60 minerals contain lead, only galena, cerussite and anglesite are commercially viable. The U.S. is the world's largest producer and consumer of refined lead metal. Major mine producers other than the U.S. include Australia, Canada, China, Peru, and Kazakhstan.

## Galena Mining Limited
The Abra Base Metals Mine in Western Australia represents one of the world's largest undeveloped lead resources. Abra is within a granted mining lease. Galena completed an outstanding feasibility study in July 2019 for development of a mine and processing facility with a 16-year life producing a high-value, high grade lead-silver concentrate.
