The advantages of Rolling process are as follows. By rolling, uniform dimensions of the components can be obtained. It uses the same tool in the sense, the same rollers are responsible for the production of various components. Close tolerance is possible for the components in the rolling. high-speed production takes place in the rolling.

The process. Spline rolling can be done by either flat [A] or circular [B] tools. Workpiece is placed between the two flat surfaces of the dies then rolled between the two surfaces whose structure is gradually increased to full spline pattern. Compressive force arises as the tools are wedge shaped and presses the pattern into the workpiece.

Jun 4, 2021Rolling is a compressive deformation process in which two opposed cylindrical instruments called rollers reduce the thickness of a slab or plate. The rolls rotate, drawing the work into the space between them and compressing it. Rolling is usually the initial step in the process of transforming raw material into a final wrought product.

## Forming Process: Definition, Classification or Types, Advantages 
Forming Process also known as Metal Forming is a large set of manufacturing process by which a raw material converted into a product. In this process, we apply stresses like tension, compression, shear, etc. to deformed the raw material.  The rolling process consists of two or more two rollers in a combination with the metal plate. In
