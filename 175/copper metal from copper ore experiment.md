## Bioleaching
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide. Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt

May 30, 2022Mineral ores, therefore, are made up of a combination of different substances and contain only a certain amount of metal. In most cases copper ores contain between 0.6 and 1 per cent of copper. Consequently one tonne of ore generates a maximum 6 to 10 kilograms of copper.

Most of the copper ores mined in the United States contain only about 1.2-1.6% copper by weight. The most common sulfide ore is chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, also known as copper pyrite or yellow copper ore. Chalcocite, Cu 2 S, is another sulfide ore. Cuprite, or red copper ore, Cu 2 O, is an oxide ore.

Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

Which ore is copper extracted from? Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper. The ores typically contain low percentages of copper and have to be concentrated before refining (e.g., via froth flotation). Figure 1: Chalcopyrite extracted from Zacatecas, Mexico.

## Copper Leaching Method - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Extraction of copper from suitable ore by leaching methods is generally assumed to cost less than the combined expense of concentration, smelting, and refining, and experimental data tend to confirm this opinion. At the Butte-Duluth plant, which is handling in excess of 100 tons of oxidized ore daily, the copper is said to cost $0.085 per pound.

Which process are used for extraction of copper? The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper.
