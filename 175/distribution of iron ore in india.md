India is endowed with fairly abundant resources of iron ore and has the largest reserve of iron ore in Asia.   The two main types of ore found in our country are hematite and magnetite. The iron ore mines occur in close proximity to the coal fields in the northeastern plateau region. About 95 per cent of total reserves of iron ore are located in the States of Odisha, Jharkhand

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
