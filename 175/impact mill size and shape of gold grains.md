## What is Grain Size? How is Grain Size measured? - Geology Page
Grain size is the diameter of singular sediment grains, or the lithified particles in clastic rocks. The term may apply to other granular materials, too. This differs from the size of a crystallite, which refers to the size of a single crystal within a particle or grain. Many crystals can be composed of a single grain.

## What Is Impact Milling? | Highwood Crossing Foods Ltd.
The "hammers" strike the whole grain in mid-air with such an impact that the grain is immediately shattered into flour. There is no friction from heat-creating stones or rollers. Temperature is the key factor here. An impact mill maintains a low temperature of about 15 C in the cooler months and up to about 30 C in the summer.
