7 days agoThe replacement of natural aggregates (NA) with recycled ones (RAC) is studied by many researchers, especially when the history of the RAC aggregate is not known. The manuscript deals with the possibilities of improving the new concrete mix by treating the aggregate by several methods, it is very good for a research but it must be thought of

This paper presents an experimental research on mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) at low and high water/binder (W/B) ratios. Concrete at two W/B ratios (0.255 and 0.586) was broken into recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). A type of thermal treatment was employed to remove mortar attached to RCA.

## Effect of Mechanically Treated Recycled Aggregates on the Long Term 
Apr 14, 2022The results suggest that the effect of mechanical treatment of recycled aggregates on the bonding characteristics of RACs may be more beneficial to mixtures of higher w/c ratios where the cement content was lower, however, such effect had evidently benefited all treated RCA combinations at all w/c ratios when reached 90 days.

## Mechanical Properties Of Recycled Aggregates Concrete
The application of recycled aggregate to use in construction activities have been practice by developed European countries and also of some Asian countries. This paper reports the results of an experimental study on the mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) as compared to natural aggregate concrete (NAC).
