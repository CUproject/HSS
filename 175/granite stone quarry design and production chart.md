## DnD Granite Quarry | EN World | Dungeons & Dragons | Tabletop 
Other than a mark on a map and a few glib phrases used as a general description, I've yet to design a functioning quarry. Now I have no knowledge of quarries or sediments, but fortunately neither does anyone else in our group. I'm interested in maps, machinery, and way to transport granite over long distances (300 miles, if possible).

Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

Not only did 350 men lose their jobs but a quarrying community and a way of life that had existed since the 1780's changed forever. Everyone in the area had lived in the shadow of Dinorwig.

## MERN- History - Granite
Unlike limestone, granite was slow to appear on the architectural stone market in Québec. It was not until railway construction began in the mid-19 th century that industrial production of granite began. Before that time, known deposits were considered to be too far from the Montréal and Québec consumer areas.
