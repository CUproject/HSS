Mica and pyrite are minerals that were used in building blocks for thousands of Celtic Tiger-era homes. Defective blocks that contain high levels of Mica can absorb water and cause cracking to external and internal walls. This can lead to structural failure to dwellings and pose a major health and safety risk.
