Rocks of the study area include greenschist-facies arkosic metasandstone, metagraywacke, slate, and metaconglomerate of the Great Smoky Group of Proterozoic Z age. Minor deposits of unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium locally mantle the bedrock. Deforma­ tion is expressed by asymmetric and overturned folds and by several major faults.
