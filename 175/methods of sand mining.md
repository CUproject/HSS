## 6 things you need to know about sand mining
Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. It is mainly used in construction and often in manufacturing as an abrasive or in concrete (Mensah 1997 ). Mining activity targets different sources as some uses require higher purity and

## Sand smuggling in Southeast Asia
Sand smuggling is a cross-border environmental crime which describes the illegal transportation of often illegally extracted natural sand and gravel. While sand smuggling and illegal mining are global concerns, they are especially acute in Asia, where continuing urbanization and the region's large construction boom are driving the increasing demand for sand.

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

## Crude Oil Extraction and Drilling Methods | CAPP
Surface Mining. Oil recovery in the oil sands uses two main methods: mining or in situ, depending on how deep the oil sands deposits are. Surface mining is used when oil sands deposits lie within 70 meters (200 feet) of the earth's surface. Twenty per cent of oil sands reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

## Oil sands surface mining - Energy Education
Surface mining is a technique used to obtain bitumen from oil sands where the oil sands deposits are located fairly close to the surface. If the reserves are shallow enough, earth moving equipment can dig out oil sand for processing. These deposits must be within 75 meters of the surface to be mined in this fashion. Resources recoverable by this type of extraction are estimated to be 65
