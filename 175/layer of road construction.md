## Roman roads
Roman roads varied from simple corduroy roads to paved roads using deep roadbeds of tamped rubble as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from between the stones and fragments of rubble, instead of becoming mud in clay soils. According to Ulpian, there were three types of roads:. Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae or militares

Bituminous Road; Bitumen is the key material in this method. This method is the most preferred due to its flexibility. It made of four layers of bitumen. The bottom layer is the thickest and the subsequent three layers keep on thinning as the get to the top. One major advantage is its elasticity as it tends to acquire the shape of load above it.

The top layer is the most heavily used layer of the road, because it is subject to the direct influence of traffic, weather and thawing agents.
