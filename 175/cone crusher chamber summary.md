## What Is a Cone Crusher and What Can It Do for You?
Apr 24, 2020. A cone crusher is one of many different types of crushers, like impact crushers, jaw crushers, and hammermills, that is used to process and reduce material like aggregates and construction and demolition waste. The cone crusher distinguishes itself from these other crushers by how it operates in processing material.

Visual inspections are crucial. In the scenario where the conveyor underneath a cone crusher stalls, the material will build up inside the crushing chamber and eventually stall the crusher. Material can stay stuck inside that cannot be seen. "No one crawls inside there to see that it is still blocked inside the cone," says Schmit.
