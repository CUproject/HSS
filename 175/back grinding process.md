## Wafer Backgrinding & Silicon Wafer Thinning Services - Syagrus Systems
The backgrinding process involves using a diamond-resin bonded grinding wheel to remove the silicon material from the back of a silicon wafer. Using a grinding wheel is highly effective, and faster and less expensive than chemical-mechanical processes and is used to remove the bulk of substrate material prior to final finish grind, polish or

## Semiconductor Technologies - Wafer Testing, Dicing and Grinding
Nov 10, 2021Equally crucial to further the semiconductor roadmap are grinding and dicing (cutting) technologies. Like wafer testing, grinding and dicing systems are dominated by only 2 players - DISCO Corporation and Tokyo Seimitsu. In the 1960s, semiconductor silicon wafer was only 23mm in diameter, and 275 microns in thickness.

##  Silicon wafer thinning, the singulation process, and die strength - DISCO
Since this process also uses the brittle mode, micro-cracks called chippings are generated on the front and rear sides of the wafer. As a countermeasure for this problem, dicing before grinding (DBG) process is also applied. In this process, as shown in Fig. 2, grooving (half-cut dicing) is performed from the front side before grinding.

MEMS memory is typically around 30 µm thick. Backgrinding removes a precise amount of material to achieve the desired thickness, but it also causes damage to the wafer's surface. That's why polishing is also used. This description of the wafer backgrinding process is high-level, but the entire fabrication process is very tightly controlled.

Abstract: in the process of wafer back grinding, mechanical grinding causes damage to the back of wafer, resulting in surface roughness and warpage. The 15.24cm (6-inch) silicon wafers were thinned by four different back thinning methods: rough grinding, fine grinding, polishing after fine grinding and wet etching after fine grinding.

Back End(BE) Process Wafer Back Grinding • The typical wafer supplied from 'wafer fab' is 600 to 750μm thick. • Wafer thinned down to the required thickness, 50um to 75um, by abrasive grinding wheel. › 1st step : Use a large grit to coarsely grind the wafer and remove the bulk of the excess wafer thickness.

## A Study on Back Grinding Tape for Ultra-thin Chip Fabrication
Especially, key process for controlling chip-shift is back grinding process. In order to control the chip-shift, 1st key point is Young's modulus of base film. Elongation of BG tape in laminating process causes chip-shift, so we have optimized base film which can be control chip-shift. The 2nd key point is elastic modulus and thicness of

## Heat Resistance Back Grinding Tape(Under Development)
Heat resistance back grinding tape can correspond to the secondary process of wafer backside. After the back-grinding process, the wafers with the heat resistance back grinding tape can be processed (wet etching, ashing, metalizing, exposure/processing and so on). Features. Structure. Applications.
