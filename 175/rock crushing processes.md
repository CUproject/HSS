How rock impacts crusher choice. Sandstone, limestone and granite are arguably the three most common aggregate used in the construction industry. But these rocks each have very different hardness and abrasiveness characteristics. The type of rock you need to process will dictate the types of crushers needed in the crushing circuit.
