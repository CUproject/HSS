## How is the cement sector approaching carbon capture technology? - CEMBUREAU
One of the key sustainability challenges currently facing the cement industry is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. CO 2 is a by-product of cement, and therefore, concrete production; it is released when fossil fuels are burnt to heat up the raw material and when the limestone is calcined in the production process.

Cement Manufacturing Process Phase II: Proportioning, Blending & Grinding. The raw materials from quarry are now routed in plant laboratory where, they are analyzed and proper proportioning of limestone and clay are making possible before the beginning of grinding. Generally, limestone is 80% and remaining 20% is the clay.

## Cement Production Process | Cement Manufacturing Process | AGICO CEMENT
There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

The European cement industry has steadily increased its use of alternative fuels (a sevenfold increase since 1990) to over 7 million tonnes in 2010. Together with energy recovery, the fuel ashes are entirely used as raw material in cement production. To increase use of alternative fuels, access to waste and biomass must also increase.

As last week's statement from CEMBUREAU makes clear, this cost benefit is still very much relevant, and could now be crucial in keeping the European cement sector afloat in the face of dire energy price rises. Alternative fuels also offer greater fuel security as they break reliance on imported energy in favour of locally-sourced fuels.

Cement is a fine, soft, powdery-type substance, mainly used to bind fine sand and coarse aggregates together in concrete. Cement is a glue, acting as a hydraulic binder, i.e. it hardens when water is added. Everyone knows the word cement, but it is often confused with concrete or mortar. Cement is a key ingredient in both concrete and mortar
