## Compressive Strength of Concrete -Cube Test, Procedure, Results
Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures. Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc

Concrete compressive strength does not depend on the full hydration of its cement particles but essentially on their closeness. 10,11 In a concrete having a water/cement ratio lower than 0.42, hydration stops when there is no more water to hydrate the cement particles. Below this critical value of 0.42, very fine cement particles can be fully hydrated but only the surface of the coarsest ones

Put another way, the higher the U-value, the poorer the insulation. Thermal insulation increases and density decreases, meaning that concrete with a lower density has a greater R-value than concrete of a higher density. Typically, the type of concrete used for floor slabs has an R-value of 0.1-0.2 per inch of thickness.

Jun 12, 2022For concrete blocks, the compressive strength is typically around 17.5 N/mm2 or 2500 psi. This means that the blocks can support a load of up to 17.5 N per square millimeter before they start to crack. Compressive strength is tested to determine how much compression a concrete block structure can endure.

## Why is Concrete Strong in Compression? (5 reasons)
Jan 5, 2021The main reason why concrete is weak in tension and strong in compression is because of its composition and structure. Under compressive stress, the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), which is the weakest link in concrete, tends to transfer the stress from one aggregate to the other. The strength requirement in this is low.
