## The Common Gold Mining Process - Gravity Separation Method
Chute for gold mining is an ancient and still used gravity separation method. And the chute is the main equipment used in the gold mining, which is a narrow wooden (or steel) chute with a dip angle of 3°-4° (maximum of 14°-16°). The working principle of chute: After the slurry is fed into the chute from the head of the trough, the ore

## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

## Grinding Machines For Gold Processing
Product Description. Ore Grinding Processing Plant Gold Milling Machine. Working Principle. The transmission device drives cylinder to rotate. Materials and water are fed from the feeding end of cylinder and materials are grinded by impact and grinding of steel balls and ores into fine particles. The continuous grinding compels the slurry to move from feeding end to discharging end.

Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

## Gold Processing Plant | Multotec
Gold milling, which is also known as fine grinding, pulverising or comminution, is a grinding process that reduces materials into a powder or finer sized particles. Milling is used to recover the maximum amount of gold from the ore by finely grinding it so that gold particles can be removed through gravity separation and/or chemical extraction.
