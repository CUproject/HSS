## Where to Find Gold in Texas: 11 Locations Likely to Hold Gold
Bonanza Gulch. The name of this site should be a dead giveaway that gold has been found here in the past! Bonanza Gulch is located about 11 miles to the West of Goler Gulch, near Red Rock canyon. Gold was first found here in 1893, with over $50,000 of gold taken from Bonanza Gulch and Goler Gulch in that year alone.
