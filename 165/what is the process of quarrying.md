## What is Quarrying Process - Mining World
Nov 1, 2021Quarrying is defined as "the process of taking rock, sand, gravel, or other minerals from the earth in series to use them to induce materials for construction purposes or some other uses". On the surface of the earth, a quarry is any such working through which minerals are drawn out. A quarry is a place where rocks, sand, or minerals are drawn

The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface, mining involves digging below the ground, sometimes at considerable depth.
