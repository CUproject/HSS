## Dolomite (rock)
Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66 million years in age).

Also known as "dolostone" or "dolomite rock," the mineral dolomite has a chemical composition of CaMg (CO3)2. Dolomite is found in global sedimentary basins. The formation is generally done by the post-depositional alteration of limestone and lime mud by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite mining survey companies still need it.

Dolomite forms in hydrothermal veins or as a pore-filling mineral in carbonate rocks, and more rarely as an accessory component in igneous pegmatites or altered mafic igneous rocks. By far though, most dolomite occurs in altered sedimentary marine rocks called dolostones or in marbles formed from the metamorphism of dolostone.

Origin of Dolomite The origin of dolomite is one of the major unsolved problems in geology. Debate has raged for decades over whether dolomite is of "primary" origin (i.e. precipitated directly from sea water), or "secondary" origin (post-depositional changes of calcitic carbonates), and if secondary by what mechanism dolomitization occurs.
