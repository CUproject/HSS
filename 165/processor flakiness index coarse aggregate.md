## Exp 1 Flakiness and Elongation Index - Civil Engineers PK
Flaky and elongated particles are considered undesirable for base coarse construction as they may cause weakness with possibilities of braking down under heavy loads. BS-1241 specifies a Flakiness index not exceeding 30% irrespective of the aggregate size. Maximum permitted Elongated index is 35, 40 or 45% for aggregate sizes 2 ½'' - 2

## How to find flakiness index?aroni
The flakiness index is defined as the percentage (by mass) of stones in an aggregate having an ALD of less than 0.6 times their average dimension. Flaky aggregates tend to produce seals with less voids due to their tendency to pack more tightly than cubical aggregates, consequently flaky particles require less binder.

The flakiness index is defined as the percentage (by mass) of stones in an aggregate having an ALD of less than 0.6 times their average dimension. Flaky aggregates tend to produce seals with less voids due to their tendency to pack more tightly than cubical aggregates, consequently flaky particles require less binder.

## Types of Testing for Aggregates - Structural Guide
The flakiness index of the coarse aggregate is determined as the guidelines stipulated in BS 812 part 1. Aggregate partials are classified as flaky when they have a thickness of less than 0.6 of their mean sieve size. The index is calculated by separating the flaky particles and expressing their mass as a percentage of the mass of the sample

## Flakiness Index - CivilWeb Spreadsheets
Elongated aggregate particles can also increase the risk of segregation during handling and placing the concrete and can be more difficult to pump. In the UK the quantity of flat or elongated particles is called flakiness. The flakiness of the aggregates can be determined using a flakiness index test as detailed in BS EN 933-3.

## Testing Aggregates. Part 105. Methods for Determination of Particle 
This section of BS 812 describes the method for determining the flakiness index of coarse aggregate. Aggregate particles are classified as flaky when they have a thickness of less than 0.6 of their mean sieve size. The flakiness index of an aggregate sample is found by separating the flaky particles and expressing their mass as a percentage of
