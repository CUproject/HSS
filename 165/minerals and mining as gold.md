2 days agoWe'll become one big gold mining dump." We don't have time. Our minerals are being depleted. We're already 10, 15 years behind and we have to play catch-up, but we can't do it when the industry is in this state. It's simple: when mining companies don't do greenfield operations, there aren't new minerals lined up to be mined.

## Is Gold a Mineral or Metal? Do you even to know about it?
No. Although the above definition comes from the earth sciences field, other science professionals might not classify gold as a mineral for the sake of their studies. In health sciences, minerals are defined as chemical elements that are beneficial for the bodies of living organisms in some way. Most often, this translates to nutrition.

Gold. Gold is a yellow, dense, and soft metal. Its chemical symbol is Au, and it is found most commonly as free gold in nature, often associated with quartz, pyrite and other sulfide minerals. It may be found as little more than a trace within other minerals, most notably tellurides, or may be alloyed to a small extent with other metals such as

The subject is discussed in the Section on " Gold in Pyrites". Tellurides. Among minerals other than sulphides which contain gold, the tellurides are of most importance in metallurgy. Calaverite is a bronze-yellow gold telluride, usually containing a little silver, occurring in Western Australia and in certain mines in California and Colorado.
