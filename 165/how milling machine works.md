## Milling (machining)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling cutter to remove material from the surface of a work piece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points.As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter.

## How does a horizontal milling machine work? • 3axis Group
Horizontal milling machines can work at numerous angles on the workpiece. In addition, 4- and 5-axis machines use spindles simultaneously at different angles, creating complex parts in fewer cycles. 2. Processing Time. Processes are faster on horizontal milling machines thanks to more efficient feeding and simultaneous cutting on multiple axes.
