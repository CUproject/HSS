Jan 28, 2021Mark A machine has two parts labeled A and B. The probability that part A works for one year is 0.8 and the probability that part B works for one year is 0.6. The probability that at least one part works for one year is 0.9. Calculate the probability that part B works for one year, given that part A works for one year.

## Parts of an Ultrasound Machine - Articles Factory
Jul 15, 2022A basic ultrasound machine has the following parts: Transducer probe - The probe is the mouth and ears of the ultrasound machine. In the probe, there are one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals. When an electric current is applied to these crystals, they change shape rapidly. The rapid shape changes, or vibrations, of the
