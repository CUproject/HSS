## What is Recycled Aggregate Concrete?
Uses of Recycled Aggregate: - Building the base of a road. The underlying layer forms a structural foundation for paving. - Ready mix concrete. This is a mix of water, sand and cement. It can substitute for the brand-new aggregate. This includes uses for walkways, residential streets and concrete paving. - Stabilizing the soil.

History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

Depending on the size, the crushed concrete particle may comprise one or more particles of natural coarse aggregate held together and surrounded fully or partially by a layer of mortar (Fig. 1a and b).In the present study, such RCA particles are referred to as Type I RCA.
