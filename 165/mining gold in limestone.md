This can be an indicator of gold. Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz - gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides - which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides. Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.
