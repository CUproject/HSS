## What Equipment Is Used in Lithium Ore Beneficiation Process?
Sep 16, 2022In the beneficiation process, the beneficiation process of lithium ore is mainly based on the flotation process. It is also often combined with gravity separation, magnetic separation and other processes to form a joint sorting process. 1 Flotation process. Ore-type lithium ore generally includes spodumene, lepidolite, and feldspar.
