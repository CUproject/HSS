## Processing of High-Silver Gold Ores - ScienceDirect
The most convenient processing alternative for high-silver gold ores and concentrates is largely dependent on the quantity and mineralogy of the silver phases present. As far as leaching is concerned, pretreatment of the ore or modification of the leaching chemistry may be necessary to remove or diminish the negative effects of stable

The result of this process is 99.5 percent pure gold. The final step is to cast the gold into electrodes or anodes and place them in an electrolytic cell. The refiners will then pass an electric current through the cell. At the end of this process, the gold will be 99.99 percent pure.

Mineral Processing. The mined ore is crushed and milled before the flotation process to desired grain size. Crushing is done in two phases followed by milling in the bar and ball mills. The flotation process is conducted in the stages. The first stage is the silver-gold-lead flotation which is followed by the zinc-silver flotation and pyrite

Gold mines process ore using various techniques to produce an alloy composed primarily of gold and silver, which is called a dore bar. The composition of dore can vary significantly between mines, but generally the gold dore bars the Perth Mint processes are composed of between 70-80% gold and 10-15% silver.

Slurry, containing uncovered gold from primary circuits, is pumped directly to the thickener to adjust the slurry density.

## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.
