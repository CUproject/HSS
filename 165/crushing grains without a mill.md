## How do you grind grain without a mill?
How do you crush grains without a mill? Can I crush malt for homebrew without a grain mill? If you're in a pinch, you can crush malt with a rolling pin. We don't recommend this method for large batches of beer, but for ½ pound of grain, like for an extract batch, it can do the job.

## Crushing grain without a grain mill? : Homebrewing
So, I got some grain from Midwest (16# total) that was supposed to be crushed, but I guess they forgot. Whoops. Any way I could crush this myself without buying a grain mill? I read about the rolling pin method, but people say it leads to an uneven crush with poor brewing results. Any other ideas?

## Grain Crush: Coarse vs. Fine In A Russian Imperial Stout - Brülosophy
I milled both sets of grain consecutively, starting with the coarse grist, running it through my 2-roller mill with a gap setting of 0.039 inches (1 mm), which cracks the hull and exposes the starch without completely demolishing the grain. This is a common default setting for many popular homebrew mills.

## Crushin' It - Homebrew Grain Mill Gap Settings | MoreBeer
Using a standard 2-roller homebrew mill, I crushed each malt using four different gap settings. The gap settings were 1.25 mm, 1.0 mm, 0.75 mm and 0.50 mm, and I used a feeler gauge to confirm these gap setting between each milling. After milling, I performed a grain sieve test on the different malts and crushes, and recorded all of the results.

## How do you crush grain without a mill?
Malted rye is made by malting rye grain. Malting is the process of germinating and then drying grain to make it better suited for brewing. Germinating the grain activates enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Drying the grain halts the germination process and locks in the enzymes.

A properly cracked grain has a range of particle sizes that create a compromise between extraction and lautering. You are looking to crack just the outer shell of the grain. A Grain Mill is the ideal way to crack grain, but a rolling pin, beer bottle, etc., will work as well. Just place the grains in a zip lock bag and crack away.

## Milling Grain | MoreBeer
Jun 3, 2021What is a grain mill. A grain mill is a piece of equipment used to crush the grains (e.g., malt) to open the malt husks, exposing the grist within the husk to ensure an efficient mashing process. Ideally you want the crush to create a balance of split husks and the broken up contents of the kernel; these contents are sometimes called grits.

## Cracking grains without a mill? : r/Homebrewing - reddit
Typically they will mill grain you didn't even buy from them, in my experience. When doing partial mashes, I found it useful to use the coffee grinder blade for my magic bullet. You can only do about 4 ounces at a time, meaning it takes a few minutes to do the 1 or 2 pounds of specialty grains.

McMullan. Re: Crushing malt without a mill. by McMullan » Fri May 08, 2020 5:03 pm. A 'mill' and a 'mincer' are two very different things. A basic manual flour mill is probably cheaper than replacing your mincer and it'll do an ok job too. Probably cost you a lot less than 50kg grains It looks something like this:

I crushed grain without a mill exactly once. Used a rolling pin, a wooden board, and a big Ziplock back and crushed a handful at a time. It's slow going, but will get you what you need out of steeping grains. If I still had to crush my grain that way, I would brew with extract instead. #13 bgjohnston, May 17, 2013.

Unplug the grain mill if you have a motor-driven model. Wipe down the exterior with a clean, dry, lint-free cloth. Remove the hopper and the plates around your rollers using your screwdriver.

When you mill the malt you will notice that once in a while a crushed kernel will stick to a roller of the mill. This is ok and it only becomes a problem if a dough starts to build up on the rollers. In this case you used to much water. Run some dry malt through the mill to remove the dough. After crushing a hand full, look at the crush.

Don't use a coffee grinder to crush your grains. Even on the coarsest setting you'll still over-pulverize your grains and end up with tannin problems.
