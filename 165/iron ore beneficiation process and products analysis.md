## What we do - Anglo American - Kumba Iron Ore
We produce a high-grade iron ore that is one of the minerals that society needs to develop and prosper. Iron ore is the key component in steel, the most widely used of all metals. It is used in the construction of buildings and bridges, and manufacturing of vehicles and many household appliances. Our production process consists of: exploration

Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate. In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues.

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Investigation on mercury flow and emission in integrated primary iron 
1 day agoIn the BF process, molten iron or hot metal is produced as a product of reaction between raw materials and coke. At high-temperature iron ore, sinter, pellet and coke are charged from the top and hot gas from the bottom helps it to reduce to metallic iron. Coke plays the major role in the reduction process.
