## How does an impact crusher work? | RUBBLE MASTER
The beauty of impact crushers is their versatility in terms of input material and output size. There are many different designs out there but generally speaking impact crushers can produce material from 3" down. The smaller the input material the harder it gets to crush. The output gradation can be adjusted through various settings.

In the other crushers, most of the reduction is done by the impact of stone against metal. Customers operating old, rebuilt, or expanded plants often have problems with the shape of the product. In these cases, the addition of a Barmac VSI in the final crushing stage offers a solution to product shape problems.

##  Design of impact stone crusher machine - Citefactor
Impact stone crusher involves the use of impact rather than pressure to crush materials. The material is held within a cage, with openings of the desired size at the bottom, end or at sides to allow crushed material to escape through them. Impact stone crusher is used with soft materials, medium to hard stones and medium hard metallic ores.
