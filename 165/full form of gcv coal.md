## What is the difference between Gross Calorific Value and Net  - Support
Aug 10, 2022It is also known as Higher Heating Value (HCV). Net Calorific Value (NCV) also known as lower heating value (LHV) or lower calorific value (LCV) is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water vapour from the higher heating value. This treats any H20 formed as a vapor. Natural gas prices are decided on the basis of GCV and NCV.

## Glossary | Ares Asia
Volatile matter - Volatile matter is the material that is driven off when coal is heated to 950 °C in the absence of air under specified conditions. It consists of a mixture of gases, low-boiling-point organic compounds that condense into oils upon cooling, and tars. In general, coals with high volatile-matter content ignite easily and are highly reactive in combustion applications.

The higher calorific value or Gross calorific value (GCV) which supposes that the water of combustion is entirely condensed. The heat contained in this water is recovered. How do you find the GCV of coal? The best equation has the following form: GCV= 25.284 (M) + 30.572 (Ash) + 62.127 (VM) + 138.117 (FC) - 2890.095.
