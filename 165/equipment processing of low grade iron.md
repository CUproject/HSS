It adopts a fine screening and regrind process, and the final concentrate grade reaches over 69.5%. Chinese iron process plant was adopted the fixed fine screen, nylon screen surface material. But the nylon screen surface has a low aperture ratio, low screening efficiency. The Gongchangling iron ore uses electromagnetic vibration high-frequency

## Turning Low-grade Iron Ore into Profit in India
We tried upgrading feed Fe 45-49 grade, which is mainly the waste from the mines. This material is brought to our plant, and we are achieving upgradation of up to 57.5 per cent. From these lower grade ores, we are getting 56.5-58.5 Fe grade in the sinter and pellet concentrates,? says Harvendra Diwan, Associate Vice President (BP-2), JSW Steel.
