Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

## Calculation of Belt Conveyor
Teus Tuinenburg. First of all, a belt conveyor is a volume transporting device. The rate is calculated as : Volume = cross-section x velocity. The conveyed mass is then known by multiplying the volume rate by the density. You can change the spreadsheet calculation, where the only factor is mass flow.

## Calculate the Speed of Conveyor. - Automation & Control Engineering Forum
The way to accurately find the speed of a conveyor is to measure the length then time it for 1 or several rotations. Make a mark "Start" on the belt, measure with a long tape measure to a second point, advance the conveyor then measure from point 2 to a new point 3, and so on until eventually you come back to "start". This is the length.

After the required driving force has been calculated, compare it to the force vs speed graph below. As an example, a conveyor needs to move a load of 20 kg at 500mm/s up a 10 degree incline. The conveyor must occasionally be able to accelerate the mass at 0.5m/s^2. The width of the belt conveyor is 457mm.
