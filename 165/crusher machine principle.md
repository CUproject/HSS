## What a Can Crusher Is and How it works
The way how a can crusher works is pretty simple. Aluminum can crusher consists from a frame, handle with soft grip at the end, hinges, compressing plate and metal bolts that hold all mechanism together. These parts can be made from different materials, depending on the type of can crusher. Cheaper can crushers are made from plastic parts.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.  This design produces three major principles which all interact when breaking materials using sizer technology. The unique principles are the three-stage breaking action, the rotating screen effect, and the deep scroll tooth pattern.

Its working principle is that the material is placed between the inner and outer cones. The outer cone is fixed, and the inner cone is eccentric oscillating to crush the material clamped in it. Among all crushing machine, the structure of the cone crushing machine for sale produced by our crusher machine manufacturers is the most complicated.

## Hydraulic press
Main principle. The hydraulic press depends on Pascal's principle-the pressure throughout a closed system is constant. One part of the system is a piston acting as a pump, with a modest mechanical force acting on a small cross-sectional area; the other part is a piston with a larger area which generates a correspondingly large mechanical force. Only small-diameter tubing (which more easily

## Hydraulic rock crusher principle
Working Principle of Crushers . · The crusher head is at the moment in the close-side position. Crusher Working Principle.  · The price of the hydraulic cone crusher machine will be higher than the impact rock crusher, but the service life tends to be longer, avoiding the trouble of frequently replacing parts.
