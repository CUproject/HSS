## Impact Of Coal Mill Outlet Temperature
The Effects Of Coal Quality And Fuel. In the pulverizer mill 10, the primary air flow disturbance occurs for about 45 seconds, an outlet temperature drop is limited to about 2 F. over a three-minute time period, and mill outlet pressure and mill bowl differential settle out in less than one minute.

## heat load in coal mills
The mill outlet temperature directly impacts the dry gas loss in boiler which is a major loss. This depends on the moisture level in coal, the higher the moisture level the quantity of hot air required in mill for the same mill load is higher.  If the mill was gridding, only coal mill outlet temperature demand has been set at 105 C

The mill outlet temperature of coal-air mixture is maintained between 65 to 90 degree centigrade in the case of low and medium volatile coal. In the case of high volatile coal while the lower limit generally remains as 65 degree centigrade, the upper limit is restricted to a lower level depending on percentage of volatile content in coal.

ASH HANDLING PLANT The percentage of ash in coal is 5% in good quality coal & about 40% in poor quality coal. Power plants generally use poor quality of coal, thus amount of ash produced by it is quite large. A modern 1000MW plant produces about 4800 tons of ash daily. The stations use some conveyor arrangement to carry ash to dump sites.
