## thyssenkrupp to deliver jaw gyratory crusher to Roy Hill iron ore mine 
The jaw gyratory crusher is characterised by an especially enlarged feed opening, according to thyssenkrupp. It is normally serrated and, together with the upper part of the mantle, forms the initial crushing zone. The coarsely crushed material is then reduced to the desired product size in the crushing chamber below.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Gyratory Crusher over Jaw Crusher 
Disadvantages of gyratory crusher: (1) The gyratory crusher is twice the height of the jaw crusher, as a result of which, the construction expenditure of the plant is high. (2) The weight of this machine is 1.7~2 times higher than that of the jaw crusher with the same feeding size, so the investment fee is higher.

## Crushers - All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
The disadvantage of this type of crusher, when high capacity is required, is the relatively small discharge width, limiting the capacity as compared with the discharge circuit of a gyratory crusher. Jaw crushers are mainly used in plants producing up to approximately 1600 t/h. Primary crushing with gyratory crushers

## The Advantages and Disadvantages of Gyratory Crusher
When compared with jaw crusher, gyratory crusher has the following advantages: 1. Deep crushing cavity, continuous operation, high production capacity, low unit power consumption. It has the same feed port width with the jaw crusher. Its production capacity is up to more than twice higher than the latter, and the electricity consumption of per
