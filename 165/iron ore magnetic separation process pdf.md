## Iron ore crushing and screening process
Aug 3, 20227. Iron ore gravity separation processing process: For iron ore, the gravity separation method is mainly used to separate weakly magnetic iron ore. There are two applications: one is that the geological grade of the ore deposit is high (about 50%), but the ore body is thin or there are many interlayers.

## Magnetizing Reduction and Magnetic Separation Studies on Low-Grade Iron 
Conventionally iron and steel is produced by the reduction of high-grade iron ores in a blast furnace. About 80% of the world's iron making is achieved through the blast furnace process and rest by different direct reduction (DR) processes. The role of high-quality iron ore and concentrate as a raw material is very critical to get the best quality iron and steel [1].

 An implementation of two-step concentration (afterpurification) allowed increasing the iron content in the concentrate up to 48.2%. It forces to upgrade the process of dry magnetic separation or carry it out in the liquid phase (so-called, wet separation). Fig. 5 shows the iron ore after the process of magnetic separation. More

Iron Ore Smelting Process. The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the
