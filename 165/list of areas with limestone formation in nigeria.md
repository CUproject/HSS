## The Basics of Limestone Formation | Actforlibraries
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calcite and aragonite are crystal forms of CaCO3. Limestone makes up approximately 10 percent of all the sedimentary rocks in the world. Limestone may form many erosional land formations when in contact with acid. Limestone is typically white; however, impurities present
