## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The ore is then concentrated by a chemical process. Bauxite is the name given to aluminium ore. To generate aluminium oxide, bauxite is purified, a white powder from which aluminium can be extracted. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point of more than 2000° C which makes melting very expensive.

## Were does aluminium come from? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022Aluminium is the most abundant (found in large quantities) metal in the Earth's crust . It is expensive, largely because of the amount of electricity required in the extraction process. Aluminium ore is called bauxite .  Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2000°C) so it would be expensive to melt it.

That's because aluminium in nature is bauxite. Greatly simplified it's rusted aluminium where it is together with mainly oxygen and hydrogen. You can create pure aluminium by melting it at a high enough temperature, but heating it that much cost energy. Creating 1 kg of Al from "ore" takes the same amount of energy as recycling 5 kg.

Aluminum. Aluminum is the most abundant metal element in the Earth's crust. Bauxite ore is the main source of aluminum and contains the aluminum minerals gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. Aluminum is used in the United States in packaging, transportation, and building. Because it is a mixture of minerals, bauxite itself is a rock, not a mineral.

Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

Aluminium is the most abundant (found in large quantities) metal in the Earth's crust . It is expensive, largely because of the amount of electricity required in the extraction process. Aluminium ore is called bauxite .  Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2000°C) so it would be expensive to melt it.
