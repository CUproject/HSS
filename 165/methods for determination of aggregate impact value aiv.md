## Aggregate Impact Value (AIV)
One of the tests that are done on aggregate is impact value test. The amount of patients obtained by this way is related to the value of fragmentation and can, in fact, be used as an alternative test. Materials used to test the impact value must pass the sieve No. 1/2" (12.5 mm) and stuck on the sieve No. 3/8" (9.5 mm). The impact test for

## Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV). British 
The average aggregate crushing value (ACV) and the aggregate impact value (AIV) obtained from the evaluations is 28.7 % and 29.5 % respectively and are within the acceptable standard limits. The specific gravity and water absorption gave average values of 2.60 and 0.22 % respectively while the flakiness index obtained from the analysis is 26.7%.
