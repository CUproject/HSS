## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## Characteristics Of Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology | STET
Iron Ore Beneficiation. Once deposits of iron ore are extracted from the ground, they must be processed in order to increase the iron content and decrease the concentration of gangue minerals. Each deposit has its own unique chemical properties. In order to create a usable amount of iron (Fe), other minerals must be removed from the ore.

Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.

## pelletising Archives - International Mining
Metso Outotec says it has signed a landmark contract for the delivery of an iron ore beneficiation and travelling grate pelletising plant to Africa. While the parties have agreed to not disclose the value of the contract, the scope of delivery includes the engineering and supply of key process equipment for the beneficiation and pelletising plant.
