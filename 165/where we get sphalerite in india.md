A rare treasure for gemstone collectors, sphalerite (pronounced SFAY-luh-ryte) has a fire and brilliance that is unforgettable. Sphalerite has a greater dispersion than diamond. Dispersion refers to the rainbow colors we see in some gemstones. Dispersion is the property responsible for the separation of visible white light into its spectral colors.

## Sphalerite
Sphalerite (sometimes spelled sphaelerite) is a sulfide mineral with the chemical formula (Zn,Fe)S. It is the most important ore of zinc. Sphalerite is found in a variety of deposit types, but it is primarily in sedimentary exhalative, Mississippi-Valley type, and volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. It is found in association with galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite (and other sulfides), calcite
