## weight of crushed rock per cubic foot
General Weights. Solid rock is estimated at 2.5 to 3tons per cubic meter. If rock is crushed into uniform sizes, the presence of open space between the particles causes the load to be lighter -- approximately 1.6 tons per cubic meter. Mixed sizes of crushed rock can range from 1.6 to 2.2 tons per cubic meter.
