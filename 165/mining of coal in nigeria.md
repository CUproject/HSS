## All you need to know about Nigeria's new mining law
Dec 17, 2021"There is definitely an interesting story behind the mining sector in Nigeria," says Kwadwo Sarkodie, a partner at legal firm Mayer Brown International. Before the brutal civil war between 1967 and 1970 there was an active mining sector in Nigeria, and the country was a significant exporter of certain mined minerals including coal and tin.

## Nigerian Coal Corporation
In 1909, coal was discovered in Enugu, Nigeria. The Ogbete drift mine opened six years later. The Ogbete mine's operations and others in the country were merged into a new corporation in 1950: The Nigerian Coal Corporation. The NCC was tasked with exploiting coal resources, [2] and held a monopoly on coal and coke mining, production, and sales
