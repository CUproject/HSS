Steam was generated by a boiler (Collard-Trolart, France) and introduced at constant steam flow rate (1.7 kg h −1) into the vertical tube 18.5 cm from the top. The steam/powder ratio is constant (0.53). During its fall, the powder was moistened by the steam flow inside the tube and agglomerated. Download : Download high-res image (93KB)

## Steam turbine flow & operation | Processing Magazine
After the steam leaves the exhaust section, it enters a condenser, where it is cooled to a liquid state. The process of condensing the steam usually creates a vacuum, which then brings in more steam from the steam turbine. The water is returned to the steam generation system, reheated and reused.

Granulation is the process of forming grains or granules from a powdery or solid substance, producing a granular material.It is applied in several technological processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Typically, granulation involves agglomeration of fine particles into larger granules, typically of size range between 0.2 and 4.0 mm depending on their subsequent use.

1. Introduction. Granulation, also known as agglomeration, pelletization, or balling, is a "size-enlargement process" of small particles into larger coherent and stable masses (granules), in which the original particles are still identifiable [].The aim of the granulation process is to improve the properties of the final product compared to the powder form, such as giving better flow

## Principle of compound fertilizer processing by drum steam granulation
Sep 2, 2020The important principle of compound fertilizer production by drum steam granulation is to reduce the addition of water during granulation as much as possible, and moderately increase the temperature and solubility of materials, so as to reduce the heat consumption and improve the qualified rate of pelletizing, increase the output and reduce the production cost of fertilizer production line.

Steam Granulation which is a modification on wet granulation. Steam is used as a binder instead of water. This process has many benefits. It offers higher distribution uniformity, a higher diffusion rate into powders and more favourable thermal balance during drying.
