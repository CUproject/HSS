## How Windmills Work - Realonomics
The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft which spins a generator to create electricity. How does a windmill make electricity? Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity.

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? | Department of Energy
A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.

How does an offshore wind farm work? The force of the wind turns the blades . The blades are attached to the nacelle through the hub . The low-speed shaft spins at the same speed as the blades (7 - 12 turns per minute). The gearbox increases this speed more than 100 times and transfers it to the high-speed shaft.

Naturally there will be uneven heating of the earth's surface. During the day, land heats up and the warm air over the land gets lighter and rises

The turbine needs to somehow transform the wind into electricity. To do this, it needs a way to get the generator into motion. All of the wind turbine features work together in sequence to create this

## Windmill
A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades, specifically to mill grain (), but the term is also extended to windpumps, wind turbines, and other applications.The term wind engine is sometimes used to describe such devices.. Windmills were used throughout the high medieval and early modern periods; the horizontal or panemone

## Windmill - Evolution, Types, Working of Windmill and FAQs - BYJUS
The wind energy is converted into rotational energy. The working of the windmill is explained in the figure below. When the high-speed wind blows over the windmill, the blades or sails are turned. The blades move such that the shaft starts to spin, resulting in the production of electricity. Blades control the functioning of rotor speed.
