## Adani's coal mine in North Kalimantan devastates the local environment
Adani is one of those exporters, with a large coal mine on the small island of Bunyu in the province of North Kalimantan. In early 2019, an Indonesian non-government organisation called JATAM published a report describing the impacts of mining on small islands along the 5000-km archipelago of Indonesia.
