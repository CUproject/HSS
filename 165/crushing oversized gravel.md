Probably self compacting. #57, which is 1/2 to 3/4-inch gravel is generally considered to be self compacting. This is because there are no fines to inerfer with the movement, so it goes to where there is direct contact between the particles. Short of braking the rocks, which would require a great deal of force, the material won't get any tighter.
