## Graphite Beneficiation Process - JXSC Machine
Graphite flotation process. The scale graphite flotation process is generally a closed-circuit process of multi-stage grinding, multi-stage sorting, and medium-mine order (or centralized) return. There are three forms of multi-stage processes, namely re-grinding of concentrates, re-grinding of mines and re-grinding of tailings.

Graphite flotation. Graphite diffusing from cast iron melts rising to the top of the melt. In metallographic specimen floating graphite is very clearly identifiable even with low degree of magnification. At broken or machined surfaces, the diffused and floated spherolites can be identified as dark spots even with the unaided eye ( Figures 1 to 3 ).

## 5 Stages of Graphite Processing | Mining Pedia
Jun 11, 2021Since crystalline graphite has natural floatability, and flake graphite has good floatability, so we basically use flotation method to process graphite. Kerosene and diesel oil are usually used as collectors, 2# oil (pine oil) and 4# oil are used as foaming agents. These two can be added as original liquid without preparation.
