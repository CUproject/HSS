Copper ore is a mineral block found underground. Deepslate copper ore is the deepslate variant of copper ore, usually found deeper underground. Copper ore can be generated anywhere on the Overworld in the form of blobs. In Java Edition, copper ore tries to generate 6 times per chunk in groups from 0 to 16, in layers −16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the

The SI unit of hardness is N/mm². The unit Pascal is thus used for hardness as well but hardness must not be confused with pressure.

mtngun posted this 24 February 2016. I was curious how the hardness of my 45 BHN cast bullets compared to the hardness of jacketed bullets.

## Can copper be hardened? Explained by FAQ Blog
Copper. Copper was the first metal in common use for tools and containers since it is one of the few metals available in non-oxidized form, not requiring the smelting of an ore. Copper is easily softened by heating and then cooling (it does not harden by quenching, e.g., quenching in cool water).

## How to Test the Hardness of Copper
For half hard copper, its hardness value is often designated as H02 according to ASTM B370 as the standard specification. It has a minimum tensile strength of 37Ksi and a maximum of 46Ksi with a yield strength of 30Ksi which makes it useful for instances where malleability and strength are both important.
