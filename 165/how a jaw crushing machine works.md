## how jaw crusher works | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
How Jaw Crusher Works. The distinctive feature of jaw crusher is the two plates which open and shut like animal jaws. The jaws are set at an acute angle to each other, and one jaw is pivoted so that it swings relative to the other fixed jaw. Material fed into the jaws is alternately nipped and released to fall further into the crushing chamber.
