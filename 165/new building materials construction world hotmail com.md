## List of Common Building Materials Used in Construction
Bricks were widely used from the 1700s to the 1900s because they were fairly cheap to produce, but they weren't resistant to earthquakes.. In modern times, to prevent brick buildings from falling, architects reinforce them with steel rods.. Masonry most commonly finds its use in foundations, gabion construction, walls, fireplaces, and decorating finishes.

Jan 16, 2022Apr 11, 2019· The history of building is marked by a number of trends. One is the increasing durability of the materials used. Early building materials were perishable, such as leaves, branches, and animal hides.Later, more durable natural materials—such as clay, stone, and timber—and, finally, synthetic materials—such as brick, concrete, metals, and plastics—were used.
