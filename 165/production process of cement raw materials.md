## KGS--Bull. 134, Part 2--Cement Raw Materials in Kansas
This type of small plant will produce a minimum of 150,000 barrels of cement (376 lb. per bbl.) per kiln per year. The average American plant produces about 2 to 2 1/2 million bbl. per year. The initial investment for the small plant described in the article is about $1,000,000, or 1/10 to 1/20 the cost of the conventional plant. This small

## Manufacturing Process Of Cement - Construction How
The primary raw materials for the mass production of cement can either be calcareous or argillaceous. The former ingredient is obtained from limestone, marl, cement rock, chalk, etc., whereas the latter one is procured from clay, slate, blast furnace slag, shale, etc. The process of manufacturing cement can either be a wet process or a dry process.
