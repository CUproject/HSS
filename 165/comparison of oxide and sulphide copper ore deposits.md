## In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore?
The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulfate ores. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper.

## Sulfide Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A basic principle of many processes for extracting copper and nickel from sulfide ores is to overlay the molten ore or matte with a lime-silica-iron oxide slag and blow with air or oxygen. Some of the iron present in the ore oxidizes and as a result, partitions to the slag phase, while some of the sulfur is carried off as sulfur dioxide.

## Comparison Of Oxide And Sulphide Copper Ore Deposits
Copper from beginning to end. copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. it is found in ore deposits around the world. it is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. and as alloyed in bronze coppertin alloy about 3000 bc, was the first engineering material known to man.

## sulfide and oxide gold ore
copper content if the copper oxide zone developed is to be of potential ore grade, and requires also that removal of copper be minimal. Distinction between these protore environments is signiﬁcant in exploration for copper oxide and supergene sulfide enrichment targets because prospects dominated by reactive rock units are likely

## (PDF) Leaching of low-grade copper ores: A case study for 'Kraku 
This paper deals with the investigation of column leaching of low-grade ores from the copper mine Cerovo, Serbia (the approximate Cu content in the ore ranges from 0.2 - 0.3 % with >10 % copper
