## What is a conveyor belt? All the answers you need about a conveyor belt
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system, one of the many types of conveyor systems available today. Each conveyor system requires different modules in order to function properly and do the tasks required by the belts. The different tasks can range depending on the weight required, the speed required, and the throughput

## Belt Conveyors - Design, Operation and Optimization
The design of belt conveyor systems has been one of the most common occurrences in the South African mining field for over one hundred years. Conveyors are seen on virtually all mining installations, and are the biggest problem for the plant maintenance engineer, being the cause of most plant shutdowns.

## Conveyor belt design
One example is a new family of heavy-duty conveyor belt cleaners, designed so the blade cartridge can be pulled away from the belt for safe access and replaced by a single worker. The same slide-out technology has been applied to impact cradle designs. The systems are engineered so operators can work on the equipment safely, without breaking.

Weight: The weight of the product is one of the important considerations while selecting an appropriate belt because heavy materials can bend or wrap the belt. To keep the system running properly you will need to determine the weight of your product. Size: The size of the product should be the next consideration when you purchase a belt.

Conveyors free up space in plant productions. This can create opportunities for new lines or implementing new industrial processes. They support cleaner, more sanitary stations as materials are transported on the conveyor belt system. Considering the importance of controlled sanitation in today's uncertain world, this is a major benefit.

The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.
