Coarse aggregates refer to irregular and granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone, and are used for making concrete. In most cases, Coarse is naturally occurring and can be obtained by blasting quarries or crushing them by hand or crushers. It is imperative to wash them before using them for producing concrete.

The choice of aggregate is determined by the proposed use of the concrete. Normally sand, gravel, and crushed stone are used as aggregates to make concrete. The aggregate should be well-graded to improve packing efficiency and minimize the amount of cement paste needed. Also, this makes the concrete more workable.

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Feb 19, 2022Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

Coarse aggregate is used to describe particles larger than 4.75 mm, and the term fine aggregate is used for particles smaller than 4.75mm. Fine aggregates contain particles in the size range 75 µm to 4.75 mm, and coarse aggregates from 4.75 to about 40 mm, except for mass concrete which may contain particles up to 150 mm.

Granular soils are sand or gravel . You can easily see the individual particles and water drains quite easily from them. Just like at the beach when you make a sand castle, if you take a wet handful of granular soil and make a ball, as soon as it dries it will crumble. Granular soils have the highest bearing strength and compact easily.

## Physical And Thermal Properties Of Aggregate And Its Effect On Concrete 
The effective absorption is used to calculate the weight of water absorbed (W abs) by the weight of aggregate (W agg) in the concrete mix: W abs = (EA) W agg. SM = W wet - W SSD x 100%. W SSD. It is used to calculate the additional water (W add) added to the concrete with the aggregate. W add = (SM) W agg.
