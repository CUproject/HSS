## Optimization of magnetic separation process for iron recovery from 
Fe in the steel slag is usually found in the form of steel (Fe), iron oxides (FeO, Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4 ) and iron-bearing minerals, which can be separated from slag by applying mineral processing

## Iron Recovery From Slag Processing
Iron Recovery From Discarded Copper Slag In A Rhf Direct. By using DR followed by a magnetic separation process for iron recovery from copper slag, Yang obtained iron powder of 92.05% iron content with an iron recovery rate of 81.01%, and Wang obtained iron powder of 92.96% iron content with an iron recovery rate of 93.49%.
