Always switch the machine off and allow the wheel to stop revolving. Allow the wheel to be trapped or pinched in the cut. Apply excessive pressure onto the wheel so that the driving motor slows down. Grind on the side of cutting-off wheels. Grind with a depressed centre grinding wheel at an angle below 30° to the workpiece.

5. Always use the face of the grinding wheel that is meant for grinding. 6. One should slowly move job-pieces across the face of wheel in a uniform manner. This will keep the wheel sound. 7. Grinding wheels should be checked properly timely for soundness. Suspend the wheel on a string and tap it. If the wheel rings, it is probably sound.

## TEST YOUR GRINDER SAFETY KNOWLEDGE - Fabricating and Metalworking
A worker steps up to an abrasive wheel grinder and places a piece of metal against the wheel's spinning surface. But because the machine was not adjusted correctly, the metal catches in the grinder. A split-second later the grinding wheel explodes, sending stony chunks, as deadly as shrapnel, shooting through the shop.
