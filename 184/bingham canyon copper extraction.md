The Bingham Canyon orebody is exposed over ~1.6 km vertically and has the shape of an inverted cup with distinct metal zoning. Fluid inclusions in the barren but highly veined and potassically altered deep center of the system have intermediate density  Copper was selectively precipitated in the peripheral ore zone, in contrast to complete
