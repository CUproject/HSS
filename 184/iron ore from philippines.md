## Mineral Resources | Philippine Statistics Authority
Iron ore, one of the Philippines' largest mineral deposits, is not being extracted at present. This was due to the higher cost of production, making the local prices of iron not competitive to world prices. However, exploration for possible mining sites is still being done. In 1989, there was an addition of 10.1 million MT in total reserves.

The iron ore deposit of Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine islands, occurs as a surficial mantle over serpentinized ultrabasic rocks. The ore is lateritic in origin, having been derived by subaerial decomposition of the parent serpentine rock. The Surigao deposit resembles closely the lateritic iron ores of Mayari, Cuba.

## Is there iron ore in the Philippines? - Short-Question
Iron ore, one of the Philippines' largest mineral deposits, is not being extracted at present. This was due to the higher cost of production, making the local prices of iron not competitive to world prices. However, exploration for possible mining sites is still being done. In 1989, there was an addition of 10.1 million MT in total reserves.
