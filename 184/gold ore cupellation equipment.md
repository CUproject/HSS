## Cupellation Furnace - Fire Assay Furnaces - Qingdao Decent Group
Qingdao Decent Group cupellation furnace is a kind of fire assay equipment used to detect the content of gold, silver and precious metals, also known as muffle furnace. As professional laboratory equipment, the industrial standard furnace chamber can be loaded with 50 or 100 cupels. It significantly improves the efficiency of laboratory work

## Cupellation Process - Gold Refining Machine
In the traditional cupellation process for gold and silver, the amount of silver in the gold obtained is very important. A good clean separation is difficult to achieve, as gold protects silver from attack. Therefore, the amount of silver should be sufficient. If it is less, 99.99% pure silver should be added which is called quartation.

The proper temperature for cupellation of gold ores is the same as for silver ores. The lowest temperature at which good soft lead uncovers is about 675°—that is, a dull red heat—and a good temperature for the air in the muffle is 700°, which need not be reduced throughout the operation. Litharge freezes at about 640°.

## Process Of Refining Gold | My Gold Guide
Cupellation. Cupellation is a process that purifies ores by separating gold and silver from base metals and other impurities. The process makes use of a cupel - a high temperature resistant flat bowl. The ore is placed in this cupel which is put in a special furnace.  It is also possible to refine gold without any large-scale equipment. In

## Gold Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Gold Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is to make Gold Bars, which can be used to make the Gold tier of equipment, as well as crowns, Thrones, and several other items. The equivalent of Gold Ore is Platinum Ore, which will sometimes replace Gold in a world. Gold Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes.

## Process for treating refractory gold ores by roasting under oxidizing 
The recovery of gold from refractory sulfidic-carbonaceous ores after roasting pretreatment was studied. With the addition of an oxygen-containing gas (e.g., air or oxygen-enriched air), sulfides of iron, zinc, copper and other metals arc transformed into solid oxides or sulfates and gaseous sulfur dioxide at elevated temperatures (e.g., 400

When cupellation started to be used as a way of assaying precious metal content is unclear. What we do know is that by the time Georgius Agricola wrote his De Re Metallica, which was first published in 1556, the practice was known and understood which indicates that it had already been in use for a long time. When determining the gold content of an alloy is the objective the testing process is
