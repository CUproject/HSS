## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing - GREAT MINING
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Fine ore at minus 19mm (¾") sizing is fed at a controlled rate into the open-circuit 2600mm x 3960mm (8'-6 x 13'-0) Hardinge rod mill at an average feed rate of 2,106 STPD or 87.75 STRH. Rod mill discharge at a nominal size of minus 16 mesh and a pulp density of 75 percent solids combines with ball mill discharge

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different
