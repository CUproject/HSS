## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

Iron Mining Process. From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces.  The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism
