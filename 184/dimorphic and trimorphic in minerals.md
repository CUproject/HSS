So it is, as I have myself observed, with some dimorphic plants. Esto sucede, como he tenido ocasión de observarlo yo mismo con algunas plantas dimorfas . So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic and trimorphic plants previously alluded to.

## The trimorphic life cycle in foraminifera: Observations from cultures 
With the discovery in some foraminifera of a schizont generation, a trimorphic sequence, gamontagamont-schizont-gamont, was suggested by Rhumbler in 1909 [28] (hypothesis of trimorphism). However, not until 1938 and 1990 respectively the steps schizont-gamont and agamont-schizont were described, each step in a different species [18, 34].

Feb 1, 2021In botany, diaspore heteromorphism is a phenomenon in which fruits/seeds differing in morphology and/or ecological responses are produced by an individual plant. This allows the plant to spread the risk of plant establishment over time. Diaspore heteromorphism has been described in ~300 species in 26 families of flowering plants and is an
