## Blasting Practices in Mining - what you need to know - GRT
Apr 6, 2021Air blasting in mining is a method of blasting in which compressed air at very high pressure is piped to a steel shell in a shot hole and discharged. It is often called air overpressure. An air blast is the airborne shock wave generated by an explosion. In underground mining, after an explosion a strong rush of air follows.

More than one row of holes can be blasted in the same round. A time delay in the detonation between the rows creates new free surfaces for each row.
