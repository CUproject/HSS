based on the coal screening process. The coal screen is a four-part process consisting of the following steps: 1. Identify areas with coal development potential. 2. Apply the coal unsuitability criteria (20 criteria ). 3. Assess multiple land use considerations. 4. Consult with surface owners concerning surface mining of federal coal under their

## Screening and Grading of Moist Fine Coal
Screening and classification of moist fine coal is a difficulty in screening technology research at home and abroad. As moist fine coal binds to each other, material adheres to the screen surface and blocks the screen hole, thus reducing the effective screening area and screening efficiency. And the viscous materials are not loose and stratified, making the screening process more difficult.
