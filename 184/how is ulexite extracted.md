Jan 4, 2021Ulexite is a Calcium Sodium borate crystalline mineral that is only slightly soluble in water. The expectation of a white haired chemical engineer is that if the three solutions of sodium borate, lime, and boric acid were mixed together in the right proportions, the borates and lime would react and solid would probably be something close enough

Ulexite (NaCaB 5 O 6 (OH) 6 ·5H 2 O, hydrated sodium calcium borate hydroxide), sometimes known as TV rock or Television stone, is a mineral occurring in silky white rounded crystalline masses or in parallel fibers. The natural fibers of ulexite conduct light along their long axes, by internal reflection. Ulexite was named for the German chemist Georg Ludwig Ulex () who first

everchem. #ULEXITE. 29/10/2019. Ulexite is a source of Boron that's commonly used in the chemical industry. Apart from being the main component of Boron fertilizers, Ulexite is also used in glazing, bleaching agents, glass production, flares and much more. Ulexite is usually not a mineral that is found alone.

Supercritical CO2 is an important solvent which was used in the extraction of boric acid from ulexite mineral. Heterogeneous reaction between ulexite and CO2 was studied in the presence of water at various CO2 pressures (50-90 bar). Supercritical conditions enhanced the extraction efficiency of boric acid from ulexite mineral. A 88.7% boric acid extraction efficiency was obtained at 70 °C, 90
