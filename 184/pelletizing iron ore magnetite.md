## Study of Temperature Profile in the Induration of Magnetite Iron Ore 
The pelletisation study of magnetite iron ore fines starts with green balling using limestone and bentonite as additives. Heating cycle of iron ore pellets is one of the prime segments of the whole pelletisation process. Drying, pre-heating, firing and cooling processes are collectively named as heating cycle of the process. A temperature profile is maintained throughout the induration process

Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.
