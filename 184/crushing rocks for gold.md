## How To Extract Gold From Rocks | Mojave Gold Mining
Sep 23, 2021The purpose of a gold mill, at least a simple one, is to crush and grind rock fine enough to release small particles of gold. After liberating the gold from the rock or gangue, it is then run through a gravity separation step, which will concentrate most of the gold and wash off the lighter waste rock. Step 1.

Gold ore separation uses comminution techniques to break down the excavated rock, but the material hardly looks like a lustrous yellow-orange metal. In order to properly free this rich element from the rock, the crushing stage has to be followed by a chemically active stage, such as the cyanidation process or the carbon in pulp release method.
