## Grinding Machining Process : Complete Notes - mech4study
The grinding machine provides high accuracy and fine surface finish with minimum tolerances. The machining process is done by the abrasive action of the grinding wheel; the abrasives are embedded over the periphery of the rotating wheel. In Grinding machine grinding wheel is work as a cutting tool and responsible for all machining processes.

## Classification and Selection of Cutting Tool Materials
Jun 18, 2022A cutting tool is a wedge-shaped tool with sharp edges. During machining, a cutting tool is used to shear off extra layers of material from the workpiece to achieve the desired shape, size, and accuracy. It is fixed to the machine tool. To handle the heat during the cutting process, the cutting tool should be tougher than the material to be cut.
