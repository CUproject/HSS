## Compressive Strength of Concrete - Test, Results & Procedure
The compressive strength of concrete cube test is a measure of the performance and strength of a given concrete mixture. By this single test, one can judge whether concreting has been done properly or not and whether the structure has the required strength as per the specifications. The compressive strength of concrete varies from 2500 psi (17

When, its strength have reached 99% in 28 days, still concrete continues to gain strength after that period, but that rate of gain in compressive strength is very less compared to that in 28 days. After 14 days of casting concrete, concrete gains only 9% in next 14 days. So, rate of gain of strength decreases.

Concrete is divided into several strength grades according to strength, and the strength grade of concrete is strongly divided by compression. The strength of concrete is divided into twelve grades such as C7.5, C10, C15, C20, C25, C30, C35, C40, C45, C50, C55 and C60.

## Quick Answer: What Is Compressive Strength Of Concrete?
What is standard concrete strength? Concrete footings and slabs on grade typically require a concrete of 3,500 to 4,000 psi. Suspended slabs, beams, and girders (as often found in bridges) require 3,500 to 5,000 psi. Traditional concrete walls and columns tend to range from 3,000 to 5,000 psi, while 4,000 to 5,000 psi is needed for pavement.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete | Cube Test, Procedure, calculation 
Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load carried by specimen / Cross Sectional Area surface of specimen. Take it as, Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 1500mm = 22500 mm 2 or 225 cm 2. Assume the compression load is 400 KN, Compressive Strength = (400000 /22500) = 17.77 /9.81 = 181.22 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N

## Conventional grade C20, C25 and C30 concrete mix ratio
1, meet the strength grade of concrete design. 2, meet the concrete peaceability. 3, meet the durability of the use of concrete. 4, meet the above conditions to save cement and reduce the cost of concrete. The strength of concrete is divided into twelve grades, such as C7.5, C10, C15, C20, C25, C30, C35, C40, C45, C50, C55, C60 and so on.
