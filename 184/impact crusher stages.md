## VSI Crushers - REMco
REMco Vertical Shaft Impactors are typically used in the third or fourth stage of crushing circuits. Feed rates are from 15 to 1500 TPH. Machine drive powers range from 50hp to 1500hp and feed sizes can be from 4" (100 mm) to 1/8" (2.5 mm) or less. Seven models in over 40 configurations ensure that the VSI you buy is suited to your crushing needs.

## Impact Crushers
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as

## Stationary HSI Impact Crushers, Horizontal Impact Crusher, HSI  - SRP
The modularization within our horizontal impact crushers ensures you have the same size bearings and shaft diameter used between models. This is consciously done to reduce stockholding and the costs involved. Through our parts and services section, you can easily get hold of any spare parts needed. The HSI crusher is the leader in the field
