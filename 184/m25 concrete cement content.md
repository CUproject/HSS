## Concrete Mix Design Calculation for M15 Grade as per IS 
Step 5: Cement Content Calculation. From step 2, Water cement ratio = W/C = 0.57. From step 4, Water content W = 191.6 liters = 191.6kg. 191.6 / C = 0.57. Finally, C = 336.14 Kg / m 3 of concrete. But from table 5 of IS, Minimum cement content required for moderate exposure condition for M15 grade concrete is = 240 Kg/m 3 of concrete.

mix ratio for m25 concrete = 1:1:2. We have to do following calculating steps:- Step 1 :-we have wet volume of concrete is equal to 1 cubic metre (1m3), but when we calculate actual quantity of dry ingredient cement, sand and aggregate of concrete we have to calculate dry volume of concrete. For converting wet volume to dry volume of concrete we will multiply 1.54 in wet volume of concrete

## Calculation of Cement, Sand and Aggregate for M-10, M-15, M-20 and M-25 
Cement Required for 1 ㎥ of Concrete = 565 Kgs. Assume W/C ratio = 0.45 . Water required for 1 ㎥ of Concrete = 565 x 0.45. Amount of water required for 1 ㎥ of Concrete = 254 kgs = 254 litres. Hence 254 Litres of Water is required for 1 ㎥ of M25 Concrete. Summary: - M-10 grade. concrete. 4.52 bags of cement required for 1 cu.m of M-10

Procedure for Concrete Mix Design of M25 Concrete A-0 — Determination Of Target Strength.  In the present example against mild exposure and for the case of reinforced concrete the minimum cement content is 300 kg/m 3 which is less than 362 kg/m 3. Hence cement content adopted = 362 kg/m 3. As per clause 8.2.4.2 of IS: 456

Method 3: Take a sample of each in a container/cistern (of equal volume) and fill them The CSA ratio of the M25 is 1: 1: 2, while that of the M30 is mix design (but is generally greater than M25). As the weight of the aggregate is dominating the mixture, the weight of the M30 sample will be greater. Thus, we can differentiate between samples.
