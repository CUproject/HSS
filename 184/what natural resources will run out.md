## Has the Earth Run out of any Natural Resources?
New technologies will change resource demand - from the development of hybrid cars to making timber renewable through recycling. Based off the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, it is clear that, like in the instance of cryolite, humans will likely find substitutes for natural resources before they run out.

## Natural resources will never run out | VietJack
Many people still believe that natural resources will never be used up. Actually, the world's energy resources are limited. Nobody knows exactly how much fuel is left. However, we also should use them economically and try to find out alternative sources of power. According to Professor Marvin Burnham of the New England Institute of Technology

## How Much Natural Gas Is Left In The World, & When Will We Run Out 
US total natural gas proved reserves have increased from 172.44 trillion cubic feet in 1998, 473.29 trillion cubic feet in 2020. It might be accurate to say that if reserves are staying stable or increasing year to year, unless there are issues in the supply chain, natural gas isn't at risk of running out.

At the present rate, oil deposits could run out within 50 years. Natural Gas. Compared to coal and oil, natural gas is the most renewable. Huge reserves come from ancient dead microorganisms, but not all sources are millions of years old. For example, landfills and livestock produce methane, which is a natural gas.

Natural resources include: clean air, fresh water, wind, trees and forests, animals, plants, coal, oil, soil, natural gas, phosphorus, minerals like bauxite and metals like iron, copper and gold. Renewable resources are natural resources that get replaced in nature over time. Some are remade all the time, like fresh water, or grow, like trees.

Coal and natural gas are expected to last a little longer. If we continue to use these fossil fuels at the current rate without finding additional reserves, it is expected that coal and natural gas will last until 2060. However, the consumption of natural gas grew considerably last year, rising by 4.6%.

We use natural gas to heat our homes and coal to help us produce electricity. Freshwater fish are a staple in the American diet and we pump billions of barrels of oil out of the ground to fuel our automobiles.

And if that really happens, so the deposit of gas will run out less than a decade after the stock of oil has been consumed all.
