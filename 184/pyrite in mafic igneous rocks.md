## 4.3 Classification of Igneous Rocks - Principles of Earth Science
Classification By Mineral Abundance. Igneous rocks can be divided into four categories based on their chemical composition: felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. The diagram of Bowen's reaction series ( Figure 4.6) shows that differences in chemical composition correspond to differences in the types of minerals within an igneous rock.

Relative mineral abundances of felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic volcanic (extrusive) and plutonic (intrustive) igneous rocks. For example, based on the chart, granite is composed of about 40% orthoclase, 25% quartz, 15% plagioclase, 8% muscovite, 7% biotite, and 5% amphibole; in contrast, peridotite is composed of about 75% olivine and 25% pyroxene.

## 6 Igneous Rocks and Silicate Minerals - Mineralogy - OpenGeology
Igneous rocks and minerals form from magma, molten rock that originates beneath Earth's surface. Magma often collects in large magma chambers at depth in Earth, but magma is also mobile and can flow through fissures and sometimes reach the surface. Mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones contain most magmas at or near Earth's surface.

Hornfels is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that was subjected to the heat of contact metamorphism at a shallow depth. It was "baked" by heat conducted from a nearby magma chamber, sill, dike, or lava flow. Common temperatures for the formation of hornfels range from about 1300 to 1450 degrees Fahrenheit (700 to 800 degrees Celsius).

Peridotite is a very basic, heavy (G = 3 to 3.3), green to black, coarse-grained rock, sometimes schistose, composed mostly of olivine (peridot), the other minerals being pyroxene, hornblende, with sometimes magnetite, garnet, etc. Very little or no feldspar. It usually occurs in dikes and bosses. Contains 35% to 45% of silica.

##  Cobalt—Styles of Deposits and the Search for Primary Deposits - USGS
Central African Copperbelt. The Central African Copperbeltis the only sedimentary rock-hosted stratiform copper district that contains significant cobalt. Its presence may indicate significant mafic-ultramafic rocks in the local basement. The balance of primary cobalt production is from magmatic nickel-copper and nickel laterite deposits.

## What Is Mafic Magma - Realonomics
Jan 19, 2022What does mafic mean? Definition of mafic: of relating to or being a group of usually dark-colored minerals rich in magnesium and iron. What does mafic lava mean? A mafic mineral or rock is a silicate mineral or igneous rock rich in magnesium and iron. .Mafic lava before cooling has a low viscosity in comparison with felsic lava due to the lower silica content in mafic magma.

## Pyrite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
What is Pyrite? Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster.It has a chemical composition of iron sulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineral.It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many geologists would consider it to be a ubiquitous mineral.
