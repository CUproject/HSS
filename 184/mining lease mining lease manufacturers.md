Privately-owned minerals typically are leased by companies seeking to develop them, sometimes with an option to purchase. Mining leases tend to have quite a long term -- 20 years generally is the minimum. Some leases have a stated primary term and are extended by mining operations or production, while others have a fixed term and are renewable.
