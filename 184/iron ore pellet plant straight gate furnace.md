## Iron Ore Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Shaft furnaces use pellets (produced in the same way as pellets for the BF), or lump ore. Raw material for pellets is produced by crushing and grinding low-grade iron ores—typically of the taconite class and finer than 325 mesh (0.044 mm)—and magnetically separating the iron oxide (magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 ) from the siliceous gangue.

## PLASMA HEATED FURNACE FOR IRON ORE PELLET INDURATION - Justia
In the present pelletizing apparatus, the induration of iron ore concentrate pellets is achieved in a tunnel furnace heated by plasma torches, wherein the generation of by the conventional iron ore pelletizing processes is reduced by using electricity powered plasma torches instead of burning natural gas, heavy oil or pulverized coal in burners, thereby reducing considerably industrial

## Grate-Kiln Process - Iron Ore Pelletising - PDF Free Download
The first Grate-Kiln Iron ore pelletizing plant was installed for Cleveland Cliffs Company at Humboldt, Michigan mines, USA in 1960. Since then 51 other Grate-Kiln plants have been built all over the world and the 52nd is under construction. The total installed capacity of Grate-Kiln plants exceed 122 million tons per year (year 2004) compared
