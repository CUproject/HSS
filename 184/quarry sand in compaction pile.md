## How to Compact Granular Soils - The Balance Small Business
The pile moves downward under its weight, plus the weight of the vibratory hammer. An amplitude of at least one inch is usually required to cause enough soil disturbance to achieve pile driving. Vibratory compaction works well, as the soil disturbance due to vibration causes the soil particles to move into a denser configuration.

## Sand Compaction Piles Design Guidance | Geo-Institute
Four different methods (A through D) exist for the design of SCPs in sandy soils. Kitazume (2005) provides guidance for selecting an appropriate design procedure for SCPs in sandy soils based on the application. Methods are also available for designing SCPs to support embankments on clayey soils and for mitigation of liquefaction and lateral
