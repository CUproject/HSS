Deposits of comparatively lower grade iron ore that remain relatively untouched or by-passed, are now most important because of increase in consumer demands. Deposits of comparatively low grade specular hematite amenable to beneficiation by flotation have produced concentrates superior in grade to direct shipping ores.

In some places reduction roasting of the low grade hematite ore is done to convert it into magnetic ore before the application of the magnetic separation method for the ore beneficiation. Another method which can be employed is the use of a dense medium in a gas-solid fluidized bed for the enrichment of iron ore.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
Australia is one of the world's major iron ore producers.  The Brockman Iron Formation in this province is the most significant host for high-grade hematite iron ore deposits. Magnetite is an iron oxide mineral that is generally black and highly magnetic. The latter property aids in the beneficiation of magnetite ores. Magnetite contains 72.

## The Beneficiation Techniques for 5 Types of Iron Ores in Vietnam
Mar 25, 2022There are many iron ore reserves in Vietnam and the most common types of iron ore are magnetite, hematite, siderite, limonite and high-sulfur-phosphorus iron ore.  Siderite iron ore processing flow chart. Beneficiation techniques of limonite Theoretically, being rich in crystal water, limonite has a low grade. The iron concentrates can
