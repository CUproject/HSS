## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line. As secondary crushers, they are often used behind jaw crushers

## VSI Crusher Vertical Shaft Impactor - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
The Vertical Shaft Impactors or VSI Crusher are one type of impact crushers, which offer higher reduction ratios at a lower energy consumption. These impactors. can be considered as a 'stone pump' operating like a centrifugal pump. The material is fed through the centre of the rotor, where it is accelerated to high speed before being discharged through openings in the rotor periphery.

What Is Impact Crusher|Working Principle, Parts And Types. Impact crusher working principle. When the stone falls into the working area of the blow bar (hammer), it is crushed by the impact of the blow bar on the high-speed rotating rotor, and is thrown to the apron for a second impact, and rebounds until the rotating blow bar (hammer) is hit again.

## Impact Crusher | Description | Advantages - Engineering Intro
The word impact makes sense that in this particular type of crusher some impaction is being used for crushing of rocks. In normal types of crusher pressure is generated for the crushing of rocks. But, impact crushers involve an impact method. There is a hopper one side that takes the crushing material into the machine.

## Impact Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The impact crusher (typically PE series) is widely used and of high production efficiency and good safety performance. The finished product is of cube shape and the tension force and crack is avoided. Compared with hammer crusher, the impact crusher is able to fully utilize the high-speed impact energy of entire rotor.
