Nov 2, 2020The operation of processing silica sand deposits is basically the same as processing hard rock. In a small silica sand washing plant, a jaw crusher is used to crush the raw ore to about 25mm. In large-scale silica sand washing plant, it is better to use two-stage crushing, and impact crusher is better than jaw crusher.
