## Quartz crystal in Brazil - USGS
The peak production of Brazilian quartz crystal was reached in 1943 when 2411 metric tons were exported. Minas Gerais, Goiaz, and Bahia are the principal producing states. Minor quantities are obtained from Espirito Santo and Northeastern Brazil.Primary veins and pegmatites yield secondary deposits of eluvial, colluvial, and alluvial origin.

## Quartzite
Quartzite is a very hard rock composed predominantly of an interlocking mosaic of quartz crystals. The grainy, sandpaper-like surface is glassy in appearance. Minor amounts of former cementing materials, iron oxide, silica, carbonate and clay, often migrate during recrystallization, causing streaks and lenses to form within the quartzite. [1]
