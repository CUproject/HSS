## Zimbabwe Holds Potential Lithium Deposits | E & MJ
Zimbabwe already ranks as the fifth largest producer of lithium concentrate, albeit from a single mine. Bikita Minerals, in the south of the country, has been in production for more than 50 years, producing lithium feedstock, mostly for the ceramics industry. Now, with worldwide demand for lithium at an all-time high, others are looking to get in.
