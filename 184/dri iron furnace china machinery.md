## History of the stove timelinewniaodziezy-warszawa.pl
Aug 10, 2015 · During the 1910s, gas stoves appeared with enamel coatings that made the stoves easier to clean. One important gas design of note was the AGA cooker invented in 1922 by Swedish Nobel prize winner Gustaf Dalén.

## Solving iron ore quality issues for low-carbon steel | IEEFA
Aug 9, 2022DRI-electric arc furnace (EAF) technology is proven and in use today. However, it requires high-quality iron ore (DR-grade) with iron (Fe) content of 67% and above, which has lower levels of impurities. DR-grade iron ore currently makes up only about 4% of global iron ore supply. Some fossil fuel-based steelmaking supply chain incumbents

##  Decarbonization challenge for steel - McKinsey & Company
Steel can be produced via two main processes: either using an integrated blast furnace (BF)/basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or an electric arc furnace (EAF). While integrated players produce steel from iron ore and need coal as a reductant, EAF producers use steel scrap or direct reduced iron (DRI) as their main raw material.
