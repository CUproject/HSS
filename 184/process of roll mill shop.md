## Finishing Rolling Mill Process Explanation - Hani Tech
The rolling speed is needed to set at a suitable speed, which allows the last stand to perform the final reduction at the finishing temperature between 1500° and 1650°F, to reach certain mechanical properties. After all this processing of the rolling mill through the finishing mill machine, the steel has been rolled into a flat bar nearly 200 feet.

## Why Roll Forming? - Dahlstrom Roll Form
It's the process of gradually bending a flat strip or coil of metal into a longitudinal, uniform profile. To get the desired shape, the operator passes the workpieces through a series of mated tool dies. Roll forming is a cold forming process that doesn't require heating up the metal. High-temperature, specialized equipment isn't

The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.

The presence of friction between rollers and the strip is making it pull the strip into the rollers without applying any pulling and pushing.
