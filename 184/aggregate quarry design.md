Sep 7, 2022When it comes to the type of gravel for your front garden, Gravel Master says: "We recommend that you use a 20mm sized gravel as this is easy to walk on, stand the weight of car tyres and will not scatter about. A 10mm gravel may get stuck in tyre treads and any aggregate larger than 20mm will be difficult to walk on." Schad1953Getty Images
