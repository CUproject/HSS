## Slope Stability Issues in the Opencast Limestone and Iron Ore Mines in 
The practical approach to slope stability is guided by the basic geological data, geo-technical characteristics of the slope mass, ground water details and a good measure of engineering judgment. The paper presents in brief the slope stability studies conducted by the author indifferent Indian opencast mines in limestone and iron ore sectors.

## Instability assessment of slopes in heavily jointed limestone rock 
A critical problem in surface mining is the stability of rock slopes, which is governed by the presence of geological structures such as joints, fractures, faults, shear zones and bedding planes along which failure may occur. The main purpose of rock slope stability analyses is to obtain a safer and more economic design for mining operations.

## Conditions of Stability in a Marl and Limestone Opencast Mine
The slope stability modelling included LEM analysis by Janbu and Fellenius Methods. They took into account the conditions resulting from the mining method and weather. The calculations detected that the slope was stable in dry conditions (Fs=1.19-2.45). In the wet conditions, slope stability was reduced (Fs= 1.01-1.65).

## Slope stability analysis Hero Dictionary
Slope stability analysis is a static or dynamic, analytical or empirical method to evaluate the stability of earth and rock-fill dams, embankments, excavated slopes, and natural slopes in soil and rock. Slope stability refers to the condition of inclined soil or rock slopes to withstand or undergo movement.The stability condition of slopes is a subject of study and research in soil mechanics,

They proposed the use of a stability number Ns, where: 2γH Ns = σc and γ = unit weight of rock, H = height of rock slope, σc = uniaxial compressive strength of rock. They observed that values of Ns less than about 0.5 suggest increased likelihood of brittle behaviour while values in excess of 1.0 suggest likelihood of ductile behaviour.

## Analysis of stability law and optimization of slope angle during 
Jul 21, 2022Occasional collapse failure is a typical occurrence during mine slope excavation processes. This study aimed to investigate the disaster law in the process of mining slope excavation, and further explore the optimal selection of excavation angle. Based on the systematic analysis of the residual sliding force and deformation response characteristics during slope excavation, the increment of the
