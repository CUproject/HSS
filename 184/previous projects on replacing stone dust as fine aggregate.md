## (Pdf) Studies on Unprocessed Stone Dust As Fine Aggregate in Making 
Although the specifications for sand (fine aggregate) to be used in mortar and concrete do permit the use of crushed stone dust, there appears to be a general hesitation amongst the field engineers, regarding its use, even in those areas where crushed stone dust is available almost free of cost in abundance.

## Partial Use of stone dust in concrete as an alternative of sand
Crusher stone dust can be an economic alternative to the river sand. Crusher stone dust is produced during crushing of stones into aggregates of desired size say 10mm, 20mm etc. These dusts are generally used in making blocks or land filling. It has potential to be used as partial replacement of natural river sand in concrete.

## Experimental Study of Property of Cement Concrete replacing Fine 
The suitability of crushed stone dust waste as fine aggregate for concrete has been assessed by comparing its basic properties with that of conventional concrete. The equivalent mixes were obtained by replacing natural sand by stone dust partially and fully. The test result indicate that crushed stone dust waste can be effectively used. Expand
