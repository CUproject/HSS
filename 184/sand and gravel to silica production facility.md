Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

## Construction Workers Should Know Silica: It's not just dust
Crystalline silica is a bigger worry for the health of our lungs. The most common form of crystalline silica is quartz, which is found in sand, gravel, clay, granite, diatomaceous earth, and many other forms of rock. Non-crystalline silica is found in glass, silicon carbide, and silicone. These materials are much less hazardous to the lungs.

About Silica Sand. Silica Sand--also known as quartz sand, industrial sand, white sand--is formed from quartz that has been broken down through wind and sea erosion. Commercial silica sand is mainly used in construction materials like mortar, flooring, cement/asphalt, shingles, and sealant, as it is resistant to corrosion and the elements.
