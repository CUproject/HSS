## Power Plant Explained | Working Principles - RealPars
In its simplest form, a Power Plant, known also as a Power Station, is an industrial facility used to generate electricity. To generate power, an electrical power plant needs to have an energy source. One source of energy is from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas. Then we also have nuclear power, and finally
