## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Jan 7, 2021In hard rock mining, much of the world's annual output of copper, gold and iron ore is won from open-pit operations. Other commodities produced from open-pit mining include diamonds, molybdenum, manganese, lead and zinc, uranium and a variety of industrial minerals, such as borates, talc and specialist clays.

Mar 25, 2021A rotary drill rig is one of two main types of drills used for mining. The other type is a percussion or hammer drill. For a rotary drill rig, the drill bit turns under pressure to cut into the rock. As the bit turns, the rock grinds down while compressed air sends it back up the drill to the top to keep the hole and bit clean.

By using ore sorting equipment, ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations. The entire processing line can be planned in semi-mobile form and consists only of crushers, screens, belts and sorting machines. This allows immense cost savings for transport, since the waste rock is disposed of on-site.
