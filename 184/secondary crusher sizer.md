## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The secondary crusher is mainly used to reclaim the primary crusher product. The crushed material, which is around 15 cm in diameter obtained from the ore storage, is disposed as the final crusher product. The size is usually between 0.5 and 2 cm in diameter so that it is suitable for grinding. Secondary crushers are comparatively lighter in

## Primary and secondary crushers - Welding Alloys
Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.

A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.
