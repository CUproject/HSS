The waste bottles are connected to each other by inserting the bottleneck of each bottle in the base of another bottle. However, similar to the plastic walls, plastic bricks can be used as a structural material to a limited extent - albeit with a low strength. Similarly, construction can also be made using plastic wastes made up of LDPE.
