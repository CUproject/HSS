## Igneous rock
Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic.Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust.Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of

## List Sulphide Minerals - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Taking the atomic weight of copper as 64, there are 64 parts of copper, 56 parts of iron, and 2 x 32 = 64 parts of sulphur, a total of 184 parts; hence, the proportion of copper is 64/184 = .348 = 34.8%, which is also the proportion of sulphur. The proportion of iron is 100 — (34.8 + 34.8) = 30.4%.

## Is copper a rock? Explained by FAQ Blog
There are two distinct types of copper deposits: sulfide ore and oxide ore. Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the sulfide ore mineral chalcopyrite, which accounts for about 50 percent of copper production. Sulfide ores are processed via froth floatation to obtain copper concentrate.

The most prominent characteristics of igneous rocks are their color and the size of the crystals formed in them. Their color usually varies from pink to black, depending on the mineral content of the rock in question. In these rocks, the crystals of varying size are interlocked into each other; this gives stability to the rock structure.

Copper deposits occur in sedimentary and volcanogenic rocks within a wide variety of geologic environments where there may be little or no evidence of hydrothermal alteration. Some deposits may be hypogene and have a deep-seated source for the ore fluids, but because of rapid cooling and dilution during syngenetic deposition on the ocean floor, the resulting deposits are not associated with

Facts About Copper Live Science. A few metals such as gold silver and copper can be found in pure form as metal elements Nuggets or flakes of these metals can be taken straight from rock In the title adopted for this paper the term igneous rocks is used to include all rocks which of the prairie or are gathered into heaps of coarse gravel miles east of Manhattan a piece of native copper in

##  Preliminary Model of Porphyry Copper Deposits - USGS
Relations to Igneous Rocks Porphyry copper deposits result from the condensation of supercritical fluids derived from a crystallizing magma reservoir or set of linked reservoirs in the shallow crust; most likely, the source reservoirs are at depths of 8-10 km or more.  extent of copper ore is approximately 1.4 km (Babcock and others, 1995
