## Penicillin: Biosynthesis, Structure, Fermentation Process and Uses
Benzyl penicillin is produced in exchange of α -α-AAA with activated phenylacetic acid (Fig. 6.3). About 38% of the penicillins produced commercially are used as human medicine, 12% in veterinary medicine and 43% as starting materials for the production of semi-synthetic penicillins.

## Antimicrobial resistance
The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism. A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe. All types of microbes can develop drug resistance.

The β-lactam ring is formed by isopenicillin-N synthetase; finally, side chains are added. By fermentation technology penicillin is produced from Penicillium chrysogenum.
