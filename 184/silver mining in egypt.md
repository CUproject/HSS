## Egyptian Coins - Guide to Value, Marks, History - WorthPoint
Sep 7, 2022Since there were no silver mines in Egypt, all silver had to be imported from elsewhere. The production of silver coins, therefore, was an expensive venture. Over time, the importation of silver became more and more difficult, leading Egyptian mints to rely more heavily on bronze. Most outside trades were still conducted with silver or gold.

Silver production from primary silver mines increased by 10.2 percent, as they are concentrated in countries where mining was heavily impacted by COVID restrictions in 2020. The recovery from pandemic-related disruption also led to higher silver output from gold and lead-zinc mines, by 5.8 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.

## Forgotten archaeological gems: The ancient turquoise mines of South 
Wadi Maghara, Wadi Kharig, Bir Nasb and Serabit al-Khadem were among the premium mining spots in antiquity, and visiting them today offers a different experience for history and archaeology aficionados than the temples and tombs of the Nile Valley and Delta, which reflect ancient Egyptians' beliefs in the afterlife.
