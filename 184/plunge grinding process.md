## ATLANTIC :: Centreless plunge grinding
Centreless plunge grinding. This grinding process is used whenever the workpiece is unsuitable for through-feed grinding due to its geometry. (e.g. caused by an array of different outer diameters). In terms of its basic structure it corresponds to the centreless through-feed grinding process in many aspects. In plunge grinding, however

In the previous section, Eq.(4) represents the transfer function of the plunge grinding process. In the common grinding applications, the grinding wheel wear stiffness is several orders of magnitude higher than the cutting stiffness, as it has been shown by Snoeys and Brown .Taking into account this consideration the wear stiffness can be supposed infinite compared with the cutting stiffness

## Centerless End-Feed & Plunge Grinding | Sturdy Grinding
In end-feed grinding the work piece rests between a fixed blade and a regulating wheel. As the regulating wheel spins the part, the grinding wheel comes in from the opposite side and grinds the steel. End-feed grinding is ideal for smaller parts with heads or multiple diameters that can't pass through a grinding machine. CALL NOW! (586)

## Direct adaptive control of plunge grinding process using acoustic 
The plunge grinding process is either planned a priori or adaptively controlled to achieve a desired surface finish quality using the experimentally calibrated empirical models. This adaptive control system is interfaced to a commercial CNC cylindrical grinding machine tool, and its effectiveness is demonstrated with grinding tests.

## Centerless End-Feed & Plunge Grinding | Sturdy Grinding
In end-feed grinding the work piece rests between a fixed blade and a regulating wheel. As the regulating wheel spins the part, the grinding wheel comes in from the opposite side and grinds the steel. End-feed grinding is ideal for smaller parts with heads or multiple diameters that can't pass through a grinding machine. CALL NOW! (586) .

Cylindrical grinder. The cylindrical grinder is a type of grinding machine used to shape the outside of an object. The cylindrical grinder can work on a variety of shapes, however the object must have a central axis of rotation. This includes but is not limited to such shapes as a cylinder, an ellipse, a cam, or a crankshaft.
