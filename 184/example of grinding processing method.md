In centered grinding, the shaft workpiece will be drilled holes the two ends and fixed with thimbles first. That can ensure the inner and outer concentricity and simultaneously carry out multi-section outer diameter grinding processing. It can grind more complex workpieces such as special-shaped, inclined, and eccentric workpieces.
