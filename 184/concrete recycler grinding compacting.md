## Ways to Recycle and Reuse Concrete - The Balance Small Business
How Concrete Is Recycled. Concrete is recycled by using industrial crushing equipment with jaws and large impactors. After the concrete is broken up, it is usually run through a secondary impactor and is then screened to remove dirt and particles and to separate the large and small aggregate. Additional processes and equipment, such as water
