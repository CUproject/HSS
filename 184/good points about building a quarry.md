## How do you check the quality of your regression model in Python?
Therefore, it is imperative that good data science pipeline, in addition to using an ML-focused library like Scikit-learn, include some standardized set of code to evaluate the quality of the model using statistical tests. In this article, we show such a standard set of evaluations for a multivariate linear regression problem.

## Terrain pyramids—Help | ArcGIS for Desktop - Esri
Terrain pyramids are generated through the process of point reduction, also known as point thinning. This reduces the number of measurements needed to represent a surface for a given area. For each successive pyramid level, fewer measurements are used, and the accuracy requirements necessary to display the surface drops accordingly.
