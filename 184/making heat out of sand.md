## Sand dribbling out under baseboard. What could cause this?
Differential air pressure in the basement and the room results in a small wind, which brings dust and (yes) bits of sand from the concrete or mortar. A little bit of spray foam (using the gun, not the instant-clogging single use cans) solved the problem. Share. Improve this answer. answered Nov 20, 2013 at 2:45.

## How To Make Heat Press Transfers: 7 Methods!
Iron, EasyPress, or heat press. Cutting machine. Freezer paper. Speedball screen printing ink. The design is cut (with the cutting machine) out of freezer paper to make a stencil. You've got to remember to weed out the design rather than the excess in this case!

Clicking noises mostly comes from the rear wheel area. Loose bolts, damaged bearings at the wheel area can cause clicking noises. High pitched beeping noises can be pretty irritating. Maybe a bad solenoid or bad F&P switch or damaged tires is causing it; replace them immediately. EZGO golf cart making grinding noise from the rear end.
