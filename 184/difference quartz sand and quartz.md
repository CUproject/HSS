## The mineralogy of sandstones: Quartz grains - Geological Digressions
This variety of quartz is most commonly sourced from metamorphic and sheared rock. Grains consist of several interlocking crystals (or sub-crystals), each having straight or undulating (strained) extinction. Small crystals of mica and feldspar may be included. Grains of polycrystalline quartz are best identified at medium sand size and coarser.
