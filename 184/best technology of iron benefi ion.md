## the best available technology for ore beneficiation efficiency
Apr 03, 2014 Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material.

Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

## Characteristics Of Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology | STET
Iron Ore Beneficiation. Once deposits of iron ore are extracted from the ground, they must be processed in order to increase the iron content and decrease the concentration of gangue minerals. Each deposit has its own unique chemical properties. In order to create a usable amount of iron (Fe), other minerals must be removed from the ore.
