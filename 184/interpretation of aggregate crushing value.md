Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects, systems, or organizations, [1] and comes from Latin constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction. [2] To construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: how something is built, the nature of its structure.

Aggregate crushing value result interpretation aggregate crushing value test determine aggregate aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed or finer material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions and the strength of the aggregate used in road.

##  Relationship Between Aggregate Crushing Value (Acv) and Ten Percent 
Nigerian the aggregate impact value (AIV) and aggregate crushing value (ACV) are used in scrutinizing aggregates to determine their suitability for use in road constructional work. The ACV test which is prescribed for strong and hard aggregates according to the BS 812, part 110(1990) is a relative measure of the resistance of
