## The Process Of Dolomite Mining: What You Should Know - Metis Steel
Dolomitization is the geological process in which Magnesium ions replace Calcium ions in a mineral called calcite to form carbonate mineral dolomite. It depends on specific conditions which include low Ca: Mg ratio in solution, reactant surface area, the mineralogy of the reactant, and high temperatures. Hence the dolomite mining companies are

## Cinnabar
Cinnabar (/ ˈ s ɪ n ə ˌ b ɑːr /), or cinnabarite (/ s ɪ n ə ˈ b ɑːr aɪ t /), from the Ancient Greek: κιννάβαρι (kinnabari), is the bright scarlet to brick-red form of mercury(II) sulfide (HgS). It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments.
