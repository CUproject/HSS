##  Beneficiation of a Low Grade Limestone by Flotation Column
The beneficiation study of limestone was carried out for low-grade limestone from a small Mine, near Sankagiri, Salem district. The various rock types encountered within this limestone deposit are pegmatites, quartz veins, biotite gneisses and pyroxene gneisses. A few run of mine samples were collected for petrological characterization.

Once the beneficiation plant is in place, low-grade limestone will be processed to 12.5% SiO2 content. The cement plant will then use equal quantities of beneficiated and high grade limestone. beneficiation is the solution to separate the unwanted materials so that the upgraded limestone can be fed to the cement raw meal.
