## Estimation of Organic Impurities in Aggregates as per IS: 2386 Part-2 
Jun 6, 2021Organic substances in fine aggregate or sand: If sand is extracted from the river bed; it may contain humus, organic soil, decayed vegetation, decayed animal material, etc. These organic materials interfere with the cement setting and ultimately affect the strength of concrete.

## What are organic impurities? - TeachersCollegesj
Abstract- The organic impurities in sand primarily comprise of carbon material in the form of decay of vegetables, trees and remains of animals. This paper covers an approximate determination of presence of possible injurious organic compounds in natural sand, which is to be used in cement mortar or concrete.

The level of silt and clay content ranged from 42% to 3.3% for while organic impurities ranged from 0.029 to 0.738 photometric ohms for the unwashed sand samples. With regard to compressive strength, 38% of the concrete cubes made from sand with varying sand impurities failed to meet the design strength of 25 Mpa at the age of 28 days.

## Determination Of Organic Impurities In Sand For Concrete
Jan 14, 202129/02/2016 Organic impurities in sand may be either due to decayed vegetation, humus, coal particles, or organic and industrial wastes depending upon the source of the sand. It is generally considered that organic impurities retard the setting of cement and thus have deleterious effect on the strength of concrete or mortar.

## Quality Testing of Sand for Concrete | Quality Testing of Sand for 
In order to detect presence of organic impurities in sand, add sand to the solution of sodium hydroxide or caustic soda and then stir it. Take a pinch of sand and taste it. If tasted salty then there exist some salt in sand. Take sand and rub it against the fingers. Methods of Sand testing Moisture Content Test. Clay Content Test.

## Organic Impurities in fine aggregates | Lovibond
Organic impurities, usually in the form of tannic acid and its derivatives, are typically present in fine aggregates such as sand. These may interfere with the chemical reaction of hydration and may effect the strength of the mortar or concrete where the aggregates are used. The test method for this determination conforms to the alternative procedure specified in ASTM C40.
