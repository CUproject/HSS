## Proposed beneficiation of low-grade iron ore evokes mixed reaction from 
Aug 25, 2022Steel secretary Sajay Kumar Singh on Wednesday stressed the need for beneficiation for utilizing the rising percentage of low-grade iron ore. He was of the view that in nearly 17 percent of total iron ore produced in India was of low grade. This figure, Singh said, has increased to 21 percent in .

Low grade iron ore bodies can be beneficiated using the DEC Flotation column and produce a saleable product at a low production cost per ton. Coal Industry Recovery of fine coal - which is generally minus 4mm (1/8 inch) material - began in most industrialized countries only at the start of the 1950's.

## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

"To encourage enrichment of low-grade iron ore, of which we have huge reserves, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on plant and machinery imported for setting up or substantial expansion of iron ore pellet plants or iron ore beneficiation plants from 7.5% to 2.5%".

## Investigation of Microwave Route for Beneficiation of Low-grade Iron Ore
India's 2030 vision requires a huge amount of quality iron ore, and the utilization of low-grade iron ores such as banded iron ores will play an important role to achieve the same. The absence of alumina impurities in the Banded Hematite Jasper (BHJ) ore provides it an edge over other low-grade iron ores, and has a promising potential as feed material in a blast furnace.
