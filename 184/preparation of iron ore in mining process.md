Iron ores in the form of hematite ferrous oxide and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore .

## Mining
Mining of sulfur from a deposit at the edge of Ijen's crater lake. Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
After the iron ore has been prepared by crushing and grinding during ore extraction, the ore is actually processed. The aim of this is to reduce the undesirable high proportion of admixtures to a desired minimum in order to increase the iron content. This is done by processes such as flotation or magnetic separation.
