Below 50% CS too little energy is imparted to fracture particles and above 70% CS the media will start to cataract or be thrown from the top of the pile of media with each piece of media making a single energetic impact at the bottom of the mill. Too high a speed can lead to poor milling, increased milling time and accelerated media and shell wear.

## Ball Mill Critical Speed - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball, rod, AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell. The imagery below helps explain what goes on inside a mill as speed varies. Use our online formula. The mill speed is typically defined as the percent of the Theoretical

The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies.

Too fast or too slow rotation speed will weaken or lose the crushing effect. Fodamon engineers introduce you to different grinding effects at different speeds. In order for the ball mill to perform normal grinding operations, its working speed must be less than the critical speed. Ball mills generally work in a "dropped" state.

This may cause by the change of particle size of the composites after ball milling. However, for the 9MgH 2-1LiH, the hydrogen yield increases with ball milling time but the kinetics decrease gradually. This may be due to the gradual movement of LiH from the surface to the interior of MgH 2 and to the covering of MgH 2 after ball milling.
