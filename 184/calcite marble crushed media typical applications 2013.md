## Calcite Media - H2O Distributors
Calcite is a crushed and screened white marble media which can inexpensively be used to neutralize acidic or low pH waters to a neutral, less corrosive effluent. Advantages. Low uniformity coefficient for maximum contact for controlled pH correction. Slower reacting for controlled pH correction. Inexpensive. Physical Properties. Color. Near white.
