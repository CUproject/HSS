## Easy Gardening Idea: Creating Seed Balls - Birds and Blooms
Add a pinch or two of potting soil - don't add too much or you'll have trouble closing up your ball. Then add your seeds. I added 2 - 3 sunflower seeds to each seed bomb. For herbs and vegetables, I would add 4 - 5 seeds. If you are making a wildflower seed bomb, be sure to add a good amount of seeds - at least 10 - 15.
