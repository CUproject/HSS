## Chapter 153: 15.5 Beneficiation - The Coal Handbook: Towards Cleaner 
Coal is an important fossil fuel resource for many nations due to its large remaining resources, relatively low production and processing cost and potential high energy intensity. Certain issues surround its utilisation, however, including emissions of pollutants and growing concern about climate change. The coal handbook: Towards cleaner production Volume 1 reviews the coal production supply

## COKING COAL BENEFICIATION | SciTech Connect - Elsevier
The first step of Beneficiation is to crush or grind the coal to liberate the coaly matter from ashy matter which can theoretically yield complete liberation. In the case of intergrown texture, finer grinding up to a few micron size is necessary for complete liberation whereas for free dirt ordinary crushing is sufficient (Kumar, D., 1982).

As India's coal is high in ash content, coal beneficiation should be done to reduce the ash content and improve its grade. Note: Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both.
