Double-roll crushers are able to crush more finely than single-roll crushers, because they are designed with teeth that mesh together rather than rotating past a smooth plate. They can reduce coal to as little as ¼ inch (0.6 cm) topsize, although they are more commonly operated close to 2 inches (5 cm).

Coal is probably the largest user of roll crushers, currently, though. Coal plants will use roll crushers, either single roll or double roll, as primary crushers, reducing the ROM coal. Usually, these crushers will have teeth or raised forms on the face of the roll. (Roll crushers used for minerals and metal ores have smooth faced rolls.)
