## What is the Difference Between Gravity Separation and Magnetic 
Jul 26, 2021The key difference between gravity separation and magnetic separation is that gravity separation uses gravitational force for the separation of components in a mixture, whereas magnetic separation uses magnets or magnetic material to separate components in a mixture.. Separation techniques are very important in industrial applications in order to purify and isolate desired substances by

## How does a magnetic separator work and what uses can it have?
A magnetic separator is a device that uses a magnet to remove impurities and other magnetic materials from metal. Magnetic separators can be used before, during and after the production of a material and can be adjusted to attract different types of magnetic materials at different intensity levels. Although its use is almost always industrial

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.
