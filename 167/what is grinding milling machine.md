Milling says: Remember a casting has a draft. This makes the depth of the cut vary when cutting with the draft. Make sure that the machine has enough horsepower and the work holders sufficient strength to handle the greatest depth of cut which will be encountered. This is particularly important when machining to a corner or shoulder.

Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.

## What is the Difference Between Turning, Drilling and Milling Operations 
Drilling produces a round hole in a workpiece. A tapping or drill press machine performs drilling operations. However, drilling can also be handled with a milling machine. When machining a workpiece, chips are the waste material produced during the machining process. The way the drill bit is shaped enables chips to fall away from the workpiece.

## Cryo Milling | Material Milling | AVEKA
What is Cryogenic Milling? Cryogenic milling, or cryo-milling, is the process of using liquid nitrogen to lower the temperate of the material and/or the milling process. AVEKA 's cryogenic hammer mills can typically reduce the particle size from small pellets down to the 100s of microns. Cryo-milling can be used for:

## Milling VS Grinding - DESHENG PRECISION
Milling VS Grinding Questions 3: What is Grinding? Grinding, on the other hand, is a machining process that involves the use of a disc-shaped grinding wheel to remove material from a workpiece. There are several types of grinding wheels, some of which include grindstones, angle grinders, die grinders, and specialized grinding machines.
