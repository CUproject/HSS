Results. The 18% manganese liners used prior to the trials lasted for a maximum of 12 weeks (16,800 tonnes through crusher). The first trial liners using hardfacing lasted 38 weeks (53,200 tonnes through crusher), providing 216% extra life. As this proved such a success, it was decided (correctly) that a lower-cost manganese could be used.

## What affects liner life? — SRP
Maximizing the life of wear parts is a major consideration in any efficient crushing operation. Extending the life of liners in your cone crushers can significantly reduce maintenance costs and improve productivity, so its vital that any problems in this area are identified and minimized. Sandvik&rsquo;s research has revealed five areas where liner life can be compromised.

## Maintenance of Aggregate Crushers | Agg-Net
As cone crusher liners wear, the operator threads the bowl inwards, bringing the bowl liner closer to the head, which reduces the feed opening. The reduced feed opening may decrease crusher throughput at a cost; once that cost is greater than the price of the liner change the operator should consider changing the liners.

## What Affects Liner Life? - Cast Steel Products
Poor Feeding conditions. The number one issue affecting liner life is poor feeding conditions. Compared to a properly fed crusher a poor feed can reduce the lifetime of liners by up to 70%. Feed problems often lead to uneven wear on liners, meaning they must be replaced even though large parts of the liners are still in good condition.
