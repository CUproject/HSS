## What is Kaolin? - Industrial Minerals Association - North America - IMA-NA
The primary constituent in kaolin is the mineral kaolinite, a hydrous aluminum silicate formed by the decomposition of minerals such as feldspar. The name kaolin derives from the Chinese and means high ridge. High ridge is a reference to the hill in south-eastern China where the clay was originally discovered and used.

## What is Kaolin | The Kaolin and Ball Clay Association
WHAT IS KAOLIN? Kaolin or china clay is a commercial clay composed principally of the hydrated aluminosilicate clay mineral kaolinite. The commercial value of kaolin is based on the mineral's whiteness and its fine, controllable particle size. Particle size affects fluidity, strength, plasticity, colour, abrasiveness and ease of dispersion.

Kaolin, or 'china clay' as it is commonly called, is a hydrated aluminum silicate crystalline mineral formed over many millions of years by the hydrothermal decomposition of granite rocks. Hydrous kaolin is characterized by its fine particle size, plate-like or lamellar particle shape, and chemical inertness.
