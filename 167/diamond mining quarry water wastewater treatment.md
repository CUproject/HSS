## How Does Water Treatment Work in Mining? - Netsol Water
When treating mining wastewater, one of the first steps is to return the water's pH to its original level. This is vital not only for maintaining the quality of your water, but it will also aid in the precipitation of dissolved metals. Positively charged metal ions react with negatively charged hydroxide ions when the pH of the water is raised.
