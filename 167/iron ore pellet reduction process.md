Simulation of Rotary Kiln Used in Sponge Iron Process.Rotary kiln is cylindrical in shape and is 80m long having 4.2m internal diameter.This is the reactor of the process where reduction as well as combustion reactions are carried out.The role of kiln is to convert the raw material (iron ore,coal and dolomite) into the sponge iron [8].

## Direct reduced iron
Process. Direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to remove the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)).

## WOA1 - Process for the improvement of reducibility of iron 
The present invention discloses a new process for the improvement of reducibility of iron ore pellets comprising the steps of i) preparing a raw material mixture which contain metallic Ni powder; ii) pelletizing the said mixture obtained; iii) burning the said raw pellets and iv) reducing the said burnt pellets under reducing conditions with presence of CH 4.
