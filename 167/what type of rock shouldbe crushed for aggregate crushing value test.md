## Aggregate Crushing value test procedure | Civil4M
The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.

Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.
