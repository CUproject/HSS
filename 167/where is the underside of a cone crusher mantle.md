Depending on the application, If the Cone Crusher liner is wearing evenly throughout the chamber, when it has worn down to about 1" (2.5 cm) thick at the bottom it is generally time to consider changing it. At about 3/4" to 5/8" (1.9 cm to 1.6 cm) thick, the liner will crack, causing the backing material to begin to disintegrate.
