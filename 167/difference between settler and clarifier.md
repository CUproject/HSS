## The Use of Tube Settlers in Water Treatment - Green Prophet
The difference between tube settler Vs tube clarifier is that a clarifier uses mechanical means when removing solids created by sedimentation while a settler aids in sedimentation. Tube clarifier clears what is created by tube settler. CONCLUSION . Plate settler and tube settler both are technologies used to enhance sedimentation only.

## Rectangular vs. Circular Clarifiers | Brentwood Industries
Rectangular clarifiers typically require less land than circular clarifiers for a similar surface area (21% less in theory). The reduction becomes even more significant in a multiple-unit design, where common concrete walls are used between rectangular basins. The resulting land availability is a major advantage for treatment plant layout.

generally, uv filters that people call 'sterilizers' are of a higher wattage (40 W, 60W) compared to 'clarifiers' (which can be 5W, 9W, 18W). But this is only a very rough guideline. For example, a 25W sterilizer in a small sized pond (say 1000 gallons), will only be able to act as a clarifier in a bigger pond (for example 4000 gallons).
