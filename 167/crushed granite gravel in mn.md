## Decomposed Granite vs Pea Gravel: Pros & Cons
Decomposed granite is a natural stone made by crushing larger pieces of granite into smaller ones. On the other hand, pea gravel is harvested from a gravel mine and is screened to be of uniform size and shape. Crushed granite tends to have a rougher surface than pea gravel. Pea gravel has been smoothed by erosion and is similar to river rocks.
