An example of the effect that crusher setting has on the product gradation is as follows: If the target crusher setting is 3/8 in. (10 mm) but the setting is not checked and it wears open to 1/2 in. (13 mm), then the end result is a 15 percent decrease in the minus 3/8-in. (10 mm) material size. This is a substantial decrease in productivity.

## Crusher Hero Dictionary
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
