## Biomining Rare-Earth Elements | Cornell Engineering
Cornell engineers are pioneering a novel method for mining metals that are key to unlocking a sustainable future. In the search for more sustainable energy technologies, many of the solutions humans are turning to - rechargeable batteries, massive wind turbines, electric cars, LED lighting - rely on what are known as rare-earth elements.

The rare-earth elements (REE), also called the rare-earth metals or (in context) rare-earth oxides, or the lanthanides (though yttrium and scandium are usually included as rare-earths) are a set of 17 nearly-indistinguishable lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Scandium and yttrium are considered rare-earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides

Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

## Mining the consequences of the rare earths industry | Greenbiz
In the 1990s, a number of successful Chinese mining operations began, with their rich supply of high-quality rare earths flooding the global market and driving prices down to near-record lows. The same phenomenon that lured the United States into the rare earths business — rapid price fluctuation — ushered their exit as well.
