## Construction Waste - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Construction and demolition (C&D) wastes are considered the major wastes that are produced by the construction and demolition industries. Construction and demolition waste may include packaging material and land-clearing debris. As a result of disposing of such wastes, there is a minute impact to the environment.

Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.. Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and non-polar.Its properties are similar to polyethylene, but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant.
