## The Suitability Of Limestone Aggregates For Use In Structural Concrete
Crushing Limestone to produce fine aggregate results in the generation of a substantial amount of fine sizes (minus 0.075mm or #200 mesh) commonly referred to as dust. These fines do not aid in the production of good quality concrete and therefore must be removed from the sand before combining with Coarse Aggregate and cement.
