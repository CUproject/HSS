Fill the pot with well-draining, sandy, loamy soil, and ensure there are adequate drainage holes in the bottom to prevent the roots from sitting in water. Keep the soil moist, but not wet.

## Flax Production in North Dakota | NDSU Agriculture and Extension
North Dakota is the leading producer of flax for oil and food use in the U.S. While fiber flax used to be an important crop in the U.S., almost none is grown commercially now. Fiber flax production dropped dramatically during the 19th century as cotton replaced flax as the country's dominant plant fiber. Some fiber flax still is grown in Canada.

## Flax Plant: Fibers, Seeds, And Everything Else - Epic Gardening
Flax will grow and bloom in cool weather best but can withstand lows in the mid-20s, and highs in the 90s for brief periods. At temperatures above 100 degrees, flax decreases pollen production. If you expect a snap freeze in spring, grow flax plants under frost cloth. Excessive heat reduces seed development.
