## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.

## Fruit presses and fruit crushers
Electric apple and fruit crushers. Electric scratters and crushers for apples crush the fruit into small pieces. It is easy to press the resulting mass, and the juice yield is 50-70%. The apple mills are also suitable for crushing pears, quinces, grapes, pineapples, carrots, pumpkin, ginger and other fruit and vegetables.

A construction crusher signifies a piece of equipment that is intended to reduce the size of large rocks or gravel, for construction purposes. Crushers can also be utilized to transform the shape of waste matter for simplicity in disposal, or recycling. Crushers are also employed for reducing the raw materials mix size for their differentiation, and segregation.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Cone and gyratory crushers. Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are also compression-type machines that crush material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The output is controlled by the setting between the two pieces of steel. Though the chamber is round in shape, the moving piece of steel is not meant to rotate.

## Crushers - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
