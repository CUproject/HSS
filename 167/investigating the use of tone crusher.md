Crushed stone is exceptional as a base material for asphalt, gravel, and concrete walkways. Crushed stone is also perfect for roads, and driveways. This provides durability, a strong structure, and the perfect sub-base for a building's foundation. Unlike mulch, crushed stone does not require replacement from decomposition, or attract pests.

## The Benefits Of An Impact Crusher Portable Plant - Sepro Aggregates
Jaw crushers use compression between a fixed and swing jaw in an eccentric motion to force material through the crushing chamber. One of the disadvantages of the jaw crusher is that the aggregate it produces has a flat, slabby particle shape. For most construction applications, a rounder shape is more ideal as it has better compaction
