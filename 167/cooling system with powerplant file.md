The exhaust system of a diesel engine performs three functions. 1. The exhaust system routes the spent combustion gases away from the engine, where they are diluted by the atmosphere. 2. 3. The exhaust system confines and routes the gases to the turbocharger, if used. The exhaust system allows mufflers to be used to reduce the engine noise.

HVAC Systems Are Essential to Safe Power Plant Operation. Plant equipment often costs tens of millions of dollars to maintain, yet the HVAC system may be the last item on the list in terms of regular maintenance. Yet, without the function of a well-maintained HVAC system, all the other components may be at greater risk of malfunction.

## Water for Power Plant Cooling | Union of Concerned Scientists
In the western US, wet-recirculating systems are predominant. Dry-cooling systems use air instead of water to cool the steam exiting a turbine. Dry-cooled systems use no water and can decrease total power plant water consumption by more than 90 percent. [2] The tradeoffs to these water savings are higher costs and lower efficiencies.

## Powerplant Engine Cooling Systems Oral Questions
It shortens the life of the engine parts, changes the behavior of combustion, and impairs lubrication. What is the purpose of cooling fins? They provide a larger cooling surface area for removing heat from cylinder heads of air-cooled reciprocating engines. Airflow around the cooling fins transfers the heat from the cylinder heads to the air.
