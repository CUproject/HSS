History of cement. The origin of hydraulic cements goes back to ancient Greece and Rome.The materials used were lime and a volcanic ash that slowly reacted with it in the presence of water to form a hard mass. This formed the cementing material of the Roman mortars and concretes of more than 2,000 years ago and of subsequent construction work in western Europe.
