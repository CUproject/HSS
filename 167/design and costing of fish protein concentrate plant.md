Ronald W. Hardy, Andreas Brezas, in Fish Nutrition (Fourth Edition), 2022 9.3.6.8 Flavorings. As fish feed formulations shift from using high levels of fish meal to using plant protein concentrates, the effects of these changes on feed intake must be considered.Fish are sensitive to certain tastes in their food, a trait that can be advantageous and detrimental in feed production.

Background: Bioprocessing of plant feedstuff can be a novel approach for reducing the overwhelming dependence on fish meal in aquaculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei fed solid-state fermented protein concentrates in order to replace fish meal in the diet.
