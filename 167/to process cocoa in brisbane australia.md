## Processing Cocoa, Archives RFC Australia - Growables
In well-fermented cocoa, the seed-coat is loose, and the cotyledons are easily broken into segments. D.H. Urquhart, in his book Cocoa (Longmans, 1955), describes artificial fermentation, used to assess the flavour of small batches, single pods or even individual beans. The pods were swabbed with an antiseptic, then opened under aseptic conditions.
