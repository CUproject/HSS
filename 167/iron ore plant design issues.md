## Safe carriage of Iron ore & other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.24­0.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous
