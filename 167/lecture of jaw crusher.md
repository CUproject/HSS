Jaw crusher movement is guided by pivoting one end of the swinging jaw. and an eccentric motion located at the opposite end. [4] The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws .For instance, a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22" by 30", a 46 x 46 jaw crusher has a opening of 46" square.
