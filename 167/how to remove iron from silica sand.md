## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

Granular silica removal. Silica can exist in water as relatively large particles, known as silica granules or granular silicates. Granular silica removal is generally accomplished through physical chemical separation. The most common approach is lime softening, which is a process where calcium hydroxide (lime) is added to water to remove hardness.
