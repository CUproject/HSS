## What is Dolomite - Watheroo Dolomitic Lime
True Dolomite is sourced from rock and requires crushing and screening in order to be used in agriculture or industry. It is a carbonate limestone type product that should contain between 8-12% Magnesium as Mg and 18-22% Calcium as Ca. Dolomite should contain less than 0.2% Sodium as well, so make sure you check this prior to purchasing.

Sep 3, 2021Dolomite noun. a kind of sedimentary rock resembling limestone but consisting almost entirely of the mineral dolomite. Limestone noun. A rock consisting chiefly of calcium carbonate or carbonate of lime. It sometimes contains also magnesium carbonate, and is then called magnesian or dolomitic limestone. Crystalline limestone is called marble.

Aug 10, 2021Dolomite countertops. Dolomite, also referred to as dolostone and dolomite rock, is a sedimentary rock. By weight, it contains more than 50 percent of the mineral dolomite. Dolomite's appearance is pearly or glassy. Dolomite forms naturally when limestone undergoes a chemical change after coming in contact with magnesium-rich groundwater.

## The Helpful Benefits of Dolomite Lime in Your Garden
Dolomite is a limestone compound containing calcium and magnesium. The best mixtures contain 8 to 12 percent magnesium and 18 to 23 percent calcium. These elements influence the soil pH while providing valuable nutrients to your plants. It's helpful to know Dolomite can often contain sodium, but it should only be 2 percent or less.

## How To Use Dolomite Lime For Plants
Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

Like limestone, dolomite is also a sedimentary rock. It is made up mainly of the mineral dolomite. Dolomite is also referred to as dolostone or dolomite rock. It can be found in sedimentary basins throughout the world. It is believed that dolomite forms when limestones are modified or lime muds are changed by a post deposit chemical change.

Dolomite is a double carbonate of calium and magnesium, CaCO 3, MgCO 3. It is of sedimentary origin and is supposed to have been formed due to chemical action of sea-water containing high percentage of magnesia, on limestone. Theoretically, dolomite contains: CaCO 3 - 54.35% MgCO 3 - 45.65% In other words, it contains: CaO - 30.4% MgO - 21.7%

## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference 
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

Dolomitic limestone is a combination of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. It also neutralizes acids in the growing medium, but in general is a harder limestone and dissolves slowly in the growing medium, resulting in longer term pH stability. Dolomitic limestone also provides some calcium and a little magnesium.
