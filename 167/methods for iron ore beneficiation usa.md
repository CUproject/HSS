## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

## Iron ore Beneficiation Plant - FTM Machinery
Generally, after the processing of beneficiation, the purity of iron ore is about 60%, the copper ore is about 25%, and the cobalt ore is about 20%. 3.Finishing work. After the separation, you should dry the concentrates and tailings. The fine materials should be precipitated, concentrated, filtrated, dried and washed.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Iron Ore Beneficiation Process. During the last ten years great strides have been made, on the Mesabi range, in the practice of beneficiating low grade iron ore material. By beneficiation is meant all methods of removing impurities, and raising the iron content to a point where it can be sold in open market, the principal impurities being
