## The fractional distillation of coal tar yields: - Vedantu
Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions. Chemical compounds are separated by heating them to a temperature at which one or more constituents of the mixture will vaporize. Generally, the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25°C from each other under atmospheric

Distructive distillation of coal is a process of heating a complex substance i.e. coal in limited supply of air so that it breaks down into simplier substances. In this process the coal is heated to 1000 degree celcius in absence of air to obtain different useful components such as coke, coal tar and coal gas. Scholr Boy.

## Fractional Distillation In The Coal Tar Industry
Nature Of Coal Tar. Coal tar is essentially the thick viscous liquid which is obtained by the carbonisation of coal, and is a by-product in the ordinary manufacture of coal gas. It should be differentiated from all the other forms of tar. When coal is submitted to dry distillation in horizontal or vertical retorts, the products of carbonisation

## Interaction between coal and distillation residues of coal tar during 
Abstract Co-pyrolysis of Huainan coal (HN) and its distillation residue of the primary coal tar (DRPT) was carried out in a tubular furnace. The experimental results show that the pyrolysis tar yields are 3.74%-1.48% (relatively) higher than the calculated values from blending ratios of DRPT:HN = 1:100 to 5:100, and decrease by 0.95% (relatively) at DRPT:HN = 10:100.

Purpose: Crude coal tar and its derivatives have been used in modern medicine for the treatment of psoriasis since at least 1925 as part of the Goeckerman regimen. To this day, coal tar remains a safe and highly effective option for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. However, the mechanism by which coal tar has its therapeutic effect is unknown.

## Distillation
Distillation, or classical distillation, is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation. Dry distillation is the heating of solid materials to produce gaseous products (which may condense into liquids or solids). Dry distillation may involve chemical changes such as destructive distillation or cracking and is not
