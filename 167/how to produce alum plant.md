Loosen soil before planting, and make sure to give each bulb enough space to grow. Fill planting hole with rich, amended soil. Growth Habit: Think: garden lollipop. In early spring, 2-3 flat, strappy leaves will emerge from the soil and remain close to the ground. By late spring, a single hollow flower stalk (scape) will emerge, with a papery tip.
