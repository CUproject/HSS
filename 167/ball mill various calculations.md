## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

Sep 15, 20208.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth, such as an end mill or face mill. Calculations use the desired tool diameter, number of teeth, cutting speed, and cutting feed, which should be chosen based on the specific cutting conditions, including the workpiece material and tool material.

D. Sumanth Kumar,  H.M. Mahesh, in Synthesis of Inorganic Nanomaterials, 2018 3.6.1.1 Ball Milling. A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend bulk material into QDs/nanosize using different sized balls. The working principle is simple; impact and attrition size reduction take place as the ball drops from near the top of a rotating hollow cylindrical shell.
