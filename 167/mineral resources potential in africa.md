## African Mines | Mining in Africa | Pan African
Mining is a major economic activity in South Africa, contributing approximately R350 billion to the country's GDP. There is an estimated R35 trillion worth of mineral resources still to be mined, and this will create wealth and employment for decades to come. South Africa is a leading producer of PGMs, gold, diamonds, vanadium, manganese
