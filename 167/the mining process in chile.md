## History of mining in Chile
History of mining in Chile. During most of Chile's history, from 1500 to the present, mining has been an important economic activity. 16th century mining was oriented towards the exploitation of gold placer deposits using encomienda labour. After a period of decline in the 17th century mining resurged in the 18th and early 19th century this

Chile is the number one producer of copper in the world. In 2018, the sector produced 5.8 million tons of copper. Its current world production market share is 30%. The mining sector's contribution to the country's GDP is approximately 10% (GDP 2018: ~USD $300 billion). The industry represents about 50% of the country's total exports.

The mining sector in Chile is one of the pillars of Chilean economy and copper exports alone stands for more than one third of government income. Most mining in Chile is concentrated to the Norte Grande region spanning most of the Atacama Desert.Mining products of Chile includes copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, iron and coal.Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of copper, iodine

The mining industry represents one of the main economic activities in the country; it currently represents between 12% to 14% of the GDP. This is largely explained by the fact that Chile has important reserves of different minerals, being the main producer of copper and having the largest copper reserves in the world, along with holding 51% of the reserves of lithium in the world, being one of

The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.
