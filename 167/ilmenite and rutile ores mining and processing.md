## Ilmenite
Ilmenite can be converted into pigment grade titanium dioxide via either the sulfate process or the chloride process. Ilmenite can also be improved and purified to titanium dioxide in the form of rutile using the Becher process. Ilmenite ores can also be converted to liquid iron and a titanium-rich slag using a smelting process.
