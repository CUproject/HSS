The rate of loading is 0.6 ± 0.2 N/mm 2 /s. Record the maximum force from the machine. The same procedure is followed in the testing of concrete cylinders also. Compressive strength can be calculated from the following equation. Compressive Strength = Applied Maximum Load / Top surface area of the specimen.
