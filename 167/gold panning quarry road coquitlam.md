## Local Gold (Lower mainland / Fraser Valley) - ClubTread Community
Jul 14, 2022Location: Langley, B.C., Canada. If you want to find any gold by panning. Look for bedrock with cracks in it that you can dig the dirt out of. Most of the time you have to open them up with a crow bar or you can scrape the dirt out with a spoon or sometimes a screw driver.
