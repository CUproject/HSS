## Solvay_process
The Solvay process, also referred to as the ammonia-soda process, is the major industrial process for the production of soda ash (sodium carbonate).The ammonia-soda process developed into its modern form by Ernest Solvay during the 1860s. The ingredients for this process are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from mines).

## Solvay soda ash production - Climate Policy Watcher
Jul 4, 2022About 75 percent of the world production of soda ash is synthetic ash made from sodium chloride. In the Solvay process, sodium chloride brine, limestone, metallurgical coke and ammonia are the raw materials used in a series of reactions leading to the production of soda ash. Ammonia, however, is recycled and only a small amount is lost.
