## Bio-Beneficiation of Australian Iron Ores - Potential Applications of 
Iron ore currently mined in Australia generally requires very little beneficiation. However, depleting high-grade resources means that in the future low-grade iron ore deposits will need to be mined to meet the increasing demands of the global steel industry. Along with the increased demand, the industry faces additional pressure to reduce the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing.

## Beneficiation Iron Ore In Australia
Beneficiation Iron Ore In Australia. Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite Fe 3 O 4, hematite Fe 2 O 3, goethite FeOOH, limonite FeOOH nH

## Australian iron ore beneficiation case-MECRU
The iron ore magnetic separation production line is widely used in the whole beneficiation production line, and the technology is relatively mature. Classification, the iron ore below 3mm is subjected to magnetic separation operation in the magnetic separation equipment, and the magnetic material and the non-magnetic ore powder are separated.
