The main outputs of blast furnaces includes pig iron and slag, which is formed by combination of limestone with sulfur and other impurities. Pig iron is typically tapped every 3 to 5 hours in quantities of 300 to 600 tons.After tapping, the pig iron is transported, typically in liquid form, to steel-making operations.

## Blast Furnace Process - Steel Museum
The term blast furnace comes from the blast of hot air that is blown into the lower part of the furnace at between 1400º to 2100ºF. Molten iron is produced in a blast furnace by the following steps: 1. Charge (solid iron ore, coke, and limestone) is constantly dumped into the top of the furnace. 2.

## Development of engineered cementitious composites with limestone powder 
Nowadays limestone powder and blast furnace slag (BFS) are widely used in concrete as blended materials in cement. The replacement of Portland cement by limestone powder and BFS can lower the cost and enhance the greenness of concrete, since the production of these two materials needs less energy and causes less CO 2 emission than Portland cement. .

## How it works: The Blast Furnace - THE POTTERIES
The purpose of a blast furnace is to chemically reduce and physically convert iron oxides into liquid iron called "hot metal". The blast furnace is a huge, steel stack lined with refractory brick, where iron ore, coke and limestone are dumped into the top, and preheated air is blown into the bottom. The raw materials require 6 to 8 hours to

## Steel Production - American Iron and Steel Institute
The blast furnace is the first step in producing steel from iron oxides. The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day. Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved, the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same. The blast furnace uses coke, iron ore and limestone to

## Who invented the blast furnace?ntal
When was the first blast furnace invented? The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day. Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved, the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same. The blast furnace uses coke, iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron.
