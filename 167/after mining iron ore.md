## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2).

Nov 11, 2021According to Trading Economics, the global iron ore price has collapsed from a peak of $229.2 per tonne on 12 May this year to just $115 per tonne on 19 October. As key industrial producers, such as China and Brazil, have increased production, following disruptions earlier during the Covid-19 period, the value of iron has almost halved.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship. For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands

Therefore, the mining of iron ore has been controlled by several large companies. Iron ore is the main component of steel and accounts for 95% of the world's metal use each year. The world's largest single iron ore producer is the Brazilian mining company called Vale, which produces more than 350 million tons of iron ore per year.
