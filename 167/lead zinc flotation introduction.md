##  Lead and Zinc - Energy
Lead and Zinc Lead and zinc ores are usually found together with gold and silver. A lead-zinc ore may also contain lead sulfide, zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, iron carbonate, and quartz.  Flotation is the usual mineral separation or concentration process of choice. In flotation, workers use slurry reagents to float the heavy mineral away from

The lead grade in the ore varies between 4% and 40% depending on the ore type. These lead minerals are sparingly soluble in sulfuric acid solution during zinc leach process. In the recovery of lead from leach residues, flotation is a common method. In the conventional hydrometallurgical processing of zinc, the first stage is lead flotation.

##  Effects of Process Parameters on Selective Flotation of Lead-Zinc Ore
Introduction Bulk of the world's lead and zinc is supplied from their sulphide deposits which generally occur  flotation of lead and zinc bearing minerals. For flotation of zinc the xanthate dosage was varied from 0.094 kg/t to 0.752 kg/t. The results are shown in Fig. 6. These experiments were carried out

## Copper-Lead-Zinc ores - Danafloat
The zinc reporting to the bulk flotation tails feeds the zinc circuit which is operated as previously described in the lead-zinc flotation section. Which flotation scheme used in the differential copper-lead bulk concentrate separation is generally and often dependent upon which mineral has the greater mass in the bulk concentrate.
