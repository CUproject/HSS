##  Geological Summary of the Belingwe Greenstone Belt
The Belingwe Greenstone Belt contains a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, set in a granite-gneiss terrain. Five main tectonic units are identified. The oldest unit is the ~3.5 Ga Shabani-Tokwe Gneiss Complex, forming much of the terrain to the east of the belt and partly underlying much of the greenstones.

## Archean Greenstone Belt - [PPT Powerpoint]
Belingwe Greenstone Belt (Zimbabwe) Samples taken from the NERCMAR drill hole in the 2.7 Ga Manjeri Formation in the Belingwe Greenstone Belt contain oxide and sulphide ironstones that are indicative of a complex bacteria community. The REE compositions imply an oceanic deposition similar to that of the late Archean (Bickle et. al, 1999).

## Kilimapesa Gold Mine
Kilimapesa covers the eastern end of the historically producing Migori Archaean Greenstone Belt with gold mineralisation occurring along a WNW trending complex of shear zones with orientations that roughly parallel the strike of the belt. The Migori Greenstone Belt is responsible for the majority of Kenya's gold production and comprises a
