## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

Iron ore beneficiation facilities in the country are highly inadequate i.e., only 52 concentrators cater to the need for iron ore production of about 220 MTPA (mines-316). Of this around 50% of the concentrators are exclusively in Goa region (production 33 MTPA; mines 72) dedicated solely for export and not meant for domestic consumption.

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
