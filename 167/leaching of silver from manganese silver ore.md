## Effect of Manganese on Silver Leaching - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Effect of Manganese on Silver Leaching. In Mexico and elsewhere there are large bodies of valuable silver ore containing manganese which present great, and hitherto insuperable, obstacles to a satisfactory extraction by cyanide. The proportion of the silver that is soluble in cyanide varies greatly and may be as low as 5% only.

## leaching of silver from manganese silver ore
A method for obtaining silver and manganese metal from a silver-manganese ore includes the step of leaching the ore with acidified thiourea. More specifically, the method includes the step of leaching the ore with an acidic thiourea solution to form a leach liquor containing compounds of silver and manganese and an insoluble ore residue.

## Leaching Method for Recovering Silver & Manganese
Column-leaching tests were conducted on minus 2.5- plus 1.3-cm ore pieces to evaluate a dual in situ or heap leaching method for the recovery of manganese and silver from domestic manganese deposits. The method features an initial leach of the manganese with a 5-wt-pct-SO2 solution followed by a neutralization rinse, and then a second leach of
