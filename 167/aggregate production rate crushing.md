## production rate for aggregate crusher
 Then, the feeder carries the rocks to the primary crusher determining the maximum achievable production rate. The automatic control of the primary feeder is in the scope of this paper. A new feed-forward control -based approach is presented for allowing a non-interruptible and a more productive aggregate production.

As excessive wear can cause a 10-20% reduction in production, it is important to find the optimal time for the jaw turn or change in terms of cost and benefit. Again, with the same scenario with C130, we would have approximately a 70 stph reduction in production, in other words, a decrease of USD 4000 to 8000 in revenue for one day.

## Crushing Equipment Purchase Price Means Less Than You Think
Here's the math. Let's take a mid-sized crushing operation and try to quantify these costs. Assume: • 250 tons per hour production • Crushing price of $2.50 per ton • 3 crew members on shift, average hourly wage $20 per hour • 60 hours per week operation • Crushing season 26 weeks or 130 Days - Approximately 6-7 months of operation
