## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Beneficiation of Iron, Iron Extraction Process, Iron Ore Extraction
Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process. Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing, tailings were discarded with three scavenging, middlings returned to efficient thickener. Finally, iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Common Iron Ore Beneficiation Methods - Mining-pedia
The principle flow of polymetallic magnetic iron ore beneficiation process is divided into two types: weak magnetic separation-flotation method and floatation-weak magnetic separation method. The directions of the aggregate of magnetite and sulphide in these two processes are different. In the former process, the aggregate mainly enters the
