## In extraction of copper,the flux used is - Byju's
Solution. Flux, in metallurgy, is any substance introduced in the smelting of ores to promote fluidity and to remove objectionable impurities . When it is heated with ore, it combines with the earthly impurities present in ore to form easily fusible mass known as slag. The slag is lighter and insoluble in the molten metal.

## Extraction of copper from complex carbonaceous sulfide ore by direct 
Nov 1, 2021A gradual increase in copper extraction was noted when the temperature was increased from 100 to 160 °C, during which a temperature increase of 20 °C, accordingly yielded an increase of about 20% in copper extraction. However, a further increase in temperature to 180 °C, did not yield a significant improvement in copper dissolution.

## How to extract copper?aroni
Why is extracting copper bad for the environment? The extraction processes are called heap and situ leaching; during these processes, particles react with each other to create acidic mists that not only harm people's skin, eyes and lungs, but also destroy crops, deteriorate the quality of the land, and damage nearby buildings. The acid dust both smells and tastes bad.

## Extraction of copper(II) from hydrochloric acid  - ScienceDirect
The extraction behavior of copper (II) was studied with 0.1 mol/L Cyanex 921 in kerosene by varying HCl concentration from 3-7 mol/L. It was observed that extraction depends on the aqueous phase acidity. With 3 mol/L HCl only 16% extraction was obtained which increases up to 56% with 6.5 mol/L HCl and then decreases ( Fig. 1 ).

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction. Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.

In this experiment, students heat copper(II) oxide in the presence of hydrogen gas to extract copper. The copper(II) oxide reacts with hydrogen and is reduced, producing copper and water. This can be used to show the relative positions of copper and hydrogen in the reactivity series, and can also be used for percentage yield-type calculations.
