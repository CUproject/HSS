Instead breaking ores now drop raw metals. So breaking 1 iron ore results in 1 raw iron. But instead of 1 raw iron turning into 2 dusts when placed in the enrichment chambers like ores do, it takes 3 raw iron to get 4 iron dust. So instead of getting a x2 boost to ore production, the Tier 1 ore processing only gives a x1.33 boost.
