## Precision Metal Grinding - Metal Cutting Corporation
In fact, grinding is often considered a subset of cutting, and vice versa, since each grain of abrasive on a grinding wheel acts like a microscopic, sharp cutting edge that shears a tiny chip from a part surface. In general, precision metal grinding processes are used to remove small amounts of material in order to achieve a particular finish

The grinding Process is one of the widely accepted finishing operations because of its material removal capacity in a very small size of chips ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 mm.  The Coolant used in the Surface Grinding Process is used to cool the work region so that heat cannot be dissipated into the workpiece and grinding wheel.

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? | Department of Energy
A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.
