## How to Build a Decomposed Granite Patio | Wild Bloom
Spread and compact the DG in even layers. Once you have the decomposed granite, you'll spread it over the patio area in lifts. Lifts are simply incremental layers that allow you to compact only a small thickness at a time. We recommend laying down and compacting your DG in lifts of 1.5-2" at a time until you have your full thickness.

## Decomposed Granite | Walkways & Driveways - Landscape Design Advice
Decomposed granite is a paving material you might consider for certain areas, such as paths, walkways and driveways. In contrast to other materials, such as concrete, it provides a more natural appearance. Depending on how it is used, it may be more or less expensive than concrete. There are different color choices available.

## Decomposed Granite | Texas Architecture | UTSOA
Decomposed granite, or DG, is made from crushed stone and comes in a variety of colors. It is most often used as a more garden-esque paving material, or softer trail/pathway material than concrete or asphalt. If the sub-base is not compacted and a stabilizer is not applied to the DG, then it can be considered permeable.

## Calculating Decomposed Granite For Walkway
 Decomposed granite, or DG, is made up of granite aggregates a 1/4″ or smaller. Sometimes DG is so fine that it resembles sand. Decomposed granite is the least expensive way to pave a patio, walkway, or driveway. During the winter, when rain is frequent, loose decomposed granite paving will become mushy and muddy.

## Garden Guides | What Is Decomposed Granite?
Definition. Decomposed granite begins as normal granite stone, often older stone found at quarries and other areas. Over time, wind, rain, cold and heat wear away at this granite until it breaks apart into smaller and smaller pieces, finally becoming gravel. This gravel is harvested and then either kept the same size or ground down to finer

## How Much Decomposed Granite Do You Need - Blessing Gravel
Here are Two Factors to Consider: 1. Dimensions. The measurements you need to determine before ordering your decomposed granite include length, width and depth (thickness). Determining the depth of your project is especially important. Some projects like road construction, pathways or patios need thicker gravel. 2.

Our decomposed granite is crushed to 3/8″ minus. It can be used for pathways as a pavement building material. It can also be used for driveways, garden walkways, and heavy-use paths. We also offer our decomposed granite with stabilizer. Stabilizer is a non-toxic organic soil additive for decomposed granite or crushed stone surfaces.

Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.
