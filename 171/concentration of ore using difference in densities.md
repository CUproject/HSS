R.W. Kapp Jr., in Encyclopedia of Toxicology (Third Edition), 2014 Background. Titanium ore was first discovered in 1791 in Cornish beach sands by an English clergyman, William Gregor. The actual identification of the oxide was made a few years later by a German chemist, M.H. Klaproth, who gave the metal constituent of this oxide the name titanium, after the Titans of Greek mythology.

The difference ∆ of 1.0 %w/w corresponds to a density change of 0.0071 g/cm³, thus the accuracy of the NaCl solution is: (1.0 x 0.000005)/0.00710 = 0.007 %w/w. This is the average accuracy for the overall range as defined above, and only true assuming the relation of density to concentration is linear.

## Molar concentration
Molar concentration (also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. In chemistry, the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per liter, having the unit symbol mol/L or mol/dm 3 in SI unit.

Aug 29, 2022Definition of Concentration of Ore. Ore concentration is the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals in their pure form. In other words, it is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## Concentration of Ore Definition, Types and Properties of Ore - BYJUS
Magnetic Separation: This involves the use of magnetic properties of either the ore or the gangue to separate them. The ore is first ground into fine pieces and then passed on a conveyor belt passing over a magnetic roller. The magnetic ore remains on the belt and the gangue falls off the belt.
