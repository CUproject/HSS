## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

Alluvial deposits are either dredged from pond and river bottoms or sluiced from banks and floodplains with high-pressure hydraulic hoses.  More gold is recovered by cyanidation than by any other process. In cyanidation, metallic gold is oxidized and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution.  The most common method is to roast gold
