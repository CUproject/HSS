In this drill, place a thin towel about 6 inches behind the ball. Then, attempt to hit the golf ball while missing the towel. A good positioning of the towel will make it very difficult to not move the low point ahead of the ball, as a low point too far behind the ball will only result in hitting the towel.

Process Processing of the ore ranges from simple crushing and screening to a standard size, through to processes that beneficiate or upgrade the quality of the iron ore products. This is done by physical processes, which remove impurities by differences in particle density or size gravity or size separation. Processing may be wet or dry.

## Problems Drilling Wrought Iron | eHow
Drilling wrought iron also raises several safety problems. Even with the right tools, drilling can create metal shards that the drill ejects at high speeds. These shards can cause eye damage, which makes eye protection a necessity. Rough edges are another danger, which workers can safeguard against by wearing gloves and filing down the drilled

## How to drill through cast iron | Drill Villa
Nearly any drill bit can drill a hole through cast iron, including the best budget drill bit for cast iron. Usually, cast iron doesn't resist the drill bit's twisting motion, making it easier to drill. The only issue you may find is the debris. So if you want to make the cast iron drilling process more convenient, go for the black oxide

## iron processing - Iron making | Britannica
The primary objective of iron making is to release iron from chemical combination with oxygen, and, since the blast furnace is much the most efficient process, it receives the most attention here. Alternative methods known as direct reduction are used in over a score of countries, but less than 5 percent of iron is made this way. A third group of iron-making techniques classed as smelting

## How to Drill Into Cast Iron | Hunker
The best drill bit to use for cast iron is a cobalt bit with a 135-degree point angle. The angle is sharper than that on a conventional bit, making drilling faster and more accurate. Cobalt bits are brass-colored. As an alternative, you can also use a gold-colored titanium nitride bit. In fact, any high speed steel bit intended for metal
