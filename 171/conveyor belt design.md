## Conveyor belt design - keep it simple! - Habasit Expert Blog
In fabric conveyor belts every shaft affects the tracking. The number of these can be decreased by adjusting the design, although you must keep in mind the minimum roller diameters. Too small diameters will accelerate the ageing of the conveyor belt. Selection of a belt with special properties and materials may lead to unnecessarily high costs.

As belt tensions are often highest at the head pulley, belt edged stresses in these areas are also the highest in the belt. However, many conveyor design calculation programs ignore these
