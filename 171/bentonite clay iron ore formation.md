## What is Bentonite? - Industrial Minerals Association - North America
Bentonite is a clay generated frequently from the alteration of volcanic ash, consisting predominantly of smectite minerals, usually montmorillonite. Other smectite group minerals include hectorite, saponite, beidelite and nontronite. Smectites are clay minerals, i.e. they consist of individual crystallites the majority of which are <2µm in

## Methods of Testing Bentonite Clays for Agglomerating Iron-Ore 
One binder that is widely used in the production of iron-ore pellets is bentonite. The main mineral in bentonite - montmorillonite - has a unique ability to absorb water and undergoes a significant increase in volume. This phenomenon is called swelling . Study of the kinetics of swelling shows that this process is near completion after 24 h.

## Effects of bentonite fiber formation in iron ore pelletization
In the production of iron ore concentrate pellets, binders are required to improve pellet green strength. The most popular binder for this purpose is bentonite clay, which is added at a rate of approximately 0.5-1.0% by weight of moist concentrate. Bentonite is a significant cost item in iron ore pelletization, and also contributes undesirable amounts of silica to the finished pellets.
