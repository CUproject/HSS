## Coal Mining in Africa - Mining Africa
The History of Coal Mining. Coal was used in South Africa as far back as the Iron Age (300 - 1880 AD). During this time charcoal was used to melt copper and iron. Large-scale usage of coal only started happening around the middle of the 19th century. Coal mining has undergone major development over the years.
