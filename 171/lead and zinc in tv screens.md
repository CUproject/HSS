Soil sampling and characterization. A soil, which was classified as a Technosol (IUSS-WRB, 2014), was sampled in a former zinc mining area in Vazante (Minas Gerais; 17° 55′ 43″ S, 46° 49′ 15″ W), in an opencast mine whose operation discontinued for more than 15 years.According to Köppen classification, the climate is "Aw," characterized by a long period with low rainfall.

## Bioaccumulation of cadmium, lead, and zinc in agriculture-based insect 
Globally, the metal concentration in soil is increasing due to different anthropogenic and geogenic factors. These metals are taken up by plants and further transferred in the food chain through different routes. The present study was designed to assess the transfer and bioaccumulation of the heavy metals, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), in food chains from soil to berseem plants

## Lead and Zinc
The museum tells the story of lead and zinc mining that caused the community in southwestern Missouri to grow into a boomtown in the last years of the 19 th century. ALL THAT GLITTERS — Galena (the cubes) and sphalerite (the smaller masses) are often found together in the mines of the Springfield plateau of the Ozarks.

## Lead - Zinc | Energy & Mining
Around 30% of zinc used in the western world comes from recycling. In 2013 the annual world mine production of lead was is ~5.4 Mt, and zinc was 13.5 Mt. Australia's annual mine production was bout 0.69 Mt of lead and 1.35 Mt of zinc. China is the world's biggest producer of lead (56%) and zinc (37%), while Australia is the world's largest
