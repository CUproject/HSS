## Comparative Assessment of Two Methods in the Production of Fermented 
Milled dried fermented cassava root materials give the lafun (cassava flour). Lafun is fermented cassava flour, popularly consumed in south west Nigeria, owing to its high carbohydrate content which serves as a source of energy. It is usually prepared as a stiff porridge using boiled water, prior to being consumed (Oyewole and Afolami, 2001)
