Go with the foam, knowing that it won't be a perminant fix and that eventually that slab will have to come out. The gravel that was under there was meant to drain and support. The foam will only support and will eventually breakdown unless you pour concrete around the exposed area to seal it up., 10:09 AM #4.

Granite fines or rock dust is a by-product obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust. In recent days there were also been many attempts to use Fly Ash, an industrial by product as partial replacement for cement to have higher workability, long term strength and to make the concrete more economically available.

## Sand or gravel under concrete slabe-barssel
Granular soils are sand or gravel . You can easily see the individual particles and water drains quite easily from them.
