## Which Screening Setup Can Optimize Your Crushing Operation?
May 7, 2021One of the key factors that can dictate which screening setup will be most valuable is how many differently sized products is desired in the end. For example, if a portable plant utilizes more screening features such as a 3-deck versus a 2-deck screening setup, it will be able to separate product into more uniquely sized stockpiles.
