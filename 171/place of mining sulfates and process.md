Sulfide mining, unfortunately, poses several significant environmental risks. The most significant one is the threat to water quality. When sulfide ores are exposed to air and water, the result is sulfuric acid, which causes the leaching of potentially toxic heavy metals and the release of sulfates that contribute to the methylation of mercury.
