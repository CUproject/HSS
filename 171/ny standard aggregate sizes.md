4.5.2 Aggregate Size. Nominal aggregate sizes ranging from sand up to 20 mm are used in sprayed seals. Aggregate sizes up to 14 mm are common in single/single seals; 10 mm and 14 mm aggregate are usually used where there is sufficient traffic volume to warrant the use of large sized aggregates. For lower traffic volume roads and low speed

## Aggregate | Washington Asphalt Pavement Association
Aggregate. "Aggregate" is a collective term for sand, gravel and crushed stone mineral materials in their natural or processed state (NSSGA 1991). In 2009, the U.S. produced nearly 2 billion tons of aggregate at a value of about $17.2 billion. Roads and highways constitute31 percent of the total sand, stone and gravel market (NSSGA 2010).

Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.
