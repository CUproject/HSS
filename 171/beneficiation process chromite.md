## Iron Gold Chromite Ore Beneficiation Processing Plant Equipment
The materials will be fed into screen after crushing process. By screening,the suitable size material (≤25mm) will go to the next step. Oversize(>25mm) material will go back to secondary crusher to crush again. This forms a closed crush circuit. In this process, material will be grinded into suitable sizes (about 200 mesh) for beneficiation.

Chromite ores are primarily used for extraction of chromium, which is an expensive metal. For low grade chromite ores (containing less than 40% Cr 2 O 3), the chromium extraction is not usually economically viable. India possesses huge quantities of low grade chromite reserves. This deposit can be utilized after proper physical beneficiation.
