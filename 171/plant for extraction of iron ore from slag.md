## Extraction Of Iron From Plant
Extraction of iron from copper-plant slag SpringerLink. Jan 05, 2017 In the production of copper from sulfide ore, slag accumulates at the processing plant. In the present work, the phase transformations that occur in such slag during its reduction by the gasification products of carbon at 1100 and 1200°C are investigated.

In the metallurgy of iron, limestone (CaCO3 ) acts as a flux and forms calcium silicate CaSiO3 (slag). How is slag removed during extraction of iron? In this part, Haematite (Fe 2 O 3) and Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are reduced to Ferrous Oxide (FeO). The limestone also decomposes to CaO which removes the silicate impurity of the ore in the form of

Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues.
