## eccentric shaft gyratory crusher
The older long-shaft gyratory crusher which has the gear above the eccentric (Fig. 23) has another difference in that the eccentric bearing is supported by a bottom plate A. The majority of the current primary gyratory crushers are the hydraulically supported short-shaft

## Sandvik CG820 Primary Gyratory Crusher For Safe Crushing Operations - SRP
A robustly designed one-piece main shaft and reinforced shells are made for tough use. The one-piece spherical spider bearing offers 5 times longer wear life than competing spider bushing design. Well-designed crushing chambers built from strong materials make a fulcrum point that ensures a constant eccentric throw, guaranteeing up to 90% of

## Knowing the Basics Leads to Better Care - Timken Company
In a typical jaw crusher, two outer bearings located on either side of the main frame support an eccentric shaft, while two inner bearings support a movable jaw. These are commonly known as "Pitman" bearings. The reciprocating motion of the shaft moves the Pitman against a second, stationary jaw.
