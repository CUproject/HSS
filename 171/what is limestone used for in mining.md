## Uses of limestone in Nigeria
Limestone mining happens in quarry benches, where the limestone rock is separated and divided into blocks. After that, limestone can be used in all kinds of spheres. But there is a catch:  Limestone can be used to increase the alkalinity and remineralise purified water, which restores its nutrient levels and prevents pipe corrosion.

## Limestone - PUB2902 | Missouri Department of Natural Resources
Oct 13, 2020Limestone mining and utilization in Missouri began in the mid 1800s. The amount mined prior to 1920 is not known for certain. Since that time, however, reliable statistics do indicate that 3.1 billion short tons of limestone having a present value of about $17.5 billion have been mined in Missouri from 1920 to present.

Another added value was that the stone was also used by the railroad companies themselves.The durability and hardness of the limestone made it an excellent choice for the foundations for underpasses, trestles, and grades.

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Limestone is a producer of quicklime and slaked lime. It is widely used for the production of Portland cement and mortar. Limestone is burnt to create lime, along with other raw materials ash, and sand. Together, they form a product called clinker. Clinker is then mixed with gypsum and crushed to form a powdery mixture.

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone has many other uses. Powdered limestone is used as a filler in paper, paint, rubber, and plastics. Crushed limestone is used as a filter stone in on-site sewage disposal systems. Powdered limestone is also used as a sorbent (a substance that absorbs pollutants) at many coal-burning facilities. Limestone is not found everywhere.
