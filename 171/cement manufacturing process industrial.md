Producing a calcium-silicate Portland cement that conforms to specific chemical and physical specifications demands careful control of the manufacturing process. First, the raw materials - limestone, shells or chalk along with shale, clay, sand or iron ore - are mined from a quarry that's usually near the manufacturing plant.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

6 steps of the cement manufacturing process. When we talked about the manufacturing of cement, anyone who knows the cement manufacturing process slightly will mention "two grinding and one calcination", they are namely: cement raw material preparation, clinker production, and cement grinding. In the real cement production line, we detail the cement manufacturing process in six steps

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
