The result shows that 10% is the maximum replacement of sand with kenaf core to produced brick that using 50% of quarry dust. The compressive strength value of the 10% of kenaf core at 28 days is 8.16 N/mm2 while for density is 1830 kg/m3 at 28 days. All the result shows that kenaf core has the potential to be used as a lightweight fine aggregate.

The sample of quarry dust, shown in Figure 2, was analyzed in terms of physical properties and is presented in Table 4. The sieve analysis results are presented in Table 5. Table 4: Physical properties of quarry dust and natural sand.

## [PDF] Experimental Investigation on the Effect of Replacement of Sand 
Thus an increased need to identify a suitable substitute, that is eco-friendly and inexpensive quarry dust being extensively used as an alternative to the sand in the production of concrete. In this paper an attempt has been made to determine the properties of hollow concrete blocks produced by replacing sand by quarry dust.
