## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
When used underground, jaw crushers are commonly used in open circuit. This is followed by further size reduction in crushers located on the surface. When the run of mine product is conveyed directly from the mine to the crusher, the feed to the primary crusher passes under a magnet to remove tramp steel collected during the mining operation.

Presently, belt life is considered to be unlimited, with minimal, largely routine, maintenance. Crushing and conveying cost is presently $. 15/ton ($ 1. 93/ton/total mining cost) as compared to $ 24/ton haulage cost alone prior to 1968. Feeder-breakers run untended, although a mechanic visits each one twice per shift.

Jaw crushers are the most common solution in underground applications when the throughput is below 1000 tonnes per hour, depending somewhat on the scalping solutions. Above 1000 tph, primary gyratory crushers are an option. After the throughput reaches 2000 tph, jaw crushers are very rare, with the exception of a parallel plant layout.
