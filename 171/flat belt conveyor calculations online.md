## Improved Design of Large Inclination Belt Conveyor
2 days agoThe main inclined shaft of Caoyue Coal Mine (formerly Caoyao Coal Mine) adopts DTC100/35/2×500S 30° large inclination upward conveying belt conveyor, which improves the management level and transportation efficiency of coal transportation and reduces the labor intensity of workers, and obtained good economic and social benefits, but there are also some problems in practical use.
