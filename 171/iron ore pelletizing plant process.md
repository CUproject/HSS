## Pelletizing plant - Global Energy Monitor
Pelletizing plant. This article is part of the Global Steel Plant Tracker, a project of Global Energy Monitor. Pelletizing is the process of converting very fine iron ores into spheres (normally 8mm-20mm in diameter), known as pellets. These pellets are suitable for both blast furnaces and direct iron reduction processes.

## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is
