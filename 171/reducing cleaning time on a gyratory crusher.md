A 60-89 gyratory crusher has a standard lining of 6 tiers of concaves that need to be changed during a planned shutdown event. Normally, all the concaves would be removed piece by piece and new concaves installed. However, switching to concave segments with a different design is a quick way to reduce both downtime and maintenance.

## Crusher Hero Dictionary
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Raw material of various sizes are brought to the primary crusher by rear-dump haul units, or carried by a wheel front-end loader. Primary crushing reduces excavated rock to a more manageable size. There are different types of primary secondary and tertiary crushers including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crushers, and autogenous crushers.
