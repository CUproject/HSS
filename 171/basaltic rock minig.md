## Sprinkling basalt over soil could remove huge amounts of carbon dioxide 
Aug 1, 2021Costs for distributing basalt on a sufficiently large scale would include mining and crushing the rock, transport and distribution. Goll says that a cost of roughly $150 per tonne of removed carbon dioxide is realistic, assuming that basalt is applied to land reasonably close to human infrastructures using aircraft.

Basalt makes up most of Earth's sea floor, as well as Iceland and the Hawaiian Islands. Despite being an extrusive igneous rock, basalt has a lower mining time than granite and diorite, which are intrusive. Basalt is the only rock-like block to have both a polished and smooth variant.

Answer and Explanation: 1. The most often used method for mining basalt is surface mining in a quarry operation. Some mine large rectilinear pieces to be cut into slabs for counters, tiles, etc., but most often it is mined with explosives where the fragmented rock pieces are collected, sent to a crushing system (often multiple stages for size
