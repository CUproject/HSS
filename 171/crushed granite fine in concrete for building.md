Dig down 8 inches within the guidelines. Pour 2 inches of sand over the base of the excavated area. Pour 1 inch of a finer grade crushed stone to fill in gaps between stones. Wet the driveway, thoroughly soaking it with a garden hose, or wait for a heavy, soaking rainfall. The water helps to move stone into air pockets and tighten the structure.

Concrete fines is a recycled product made from recycled concrete aggregate and a typical substitute for natural stone aggregates. It ranges from 3/8" to a fine powder and its compact nature makes it a great sub-base material. Concrete fines is generally used as a base for pavers, roads, parking areas, and building foundations.

Decomposed granite, abbreviated as "DG" and resembling fine gravel or coarse sand, is formed from broken down granite rock. Loose DG drains well, making it an ideal mulching material for garden beds.

Probably self compacting. #57, which is 1/2 to 3/4-inch gravel is generally considered to be self compacting. This is because there are no fines to inerfer with the movement, so it goes to where there is direct contact between the particles. Short of braking the rocks, which would require a great deal of force, the material won't get any tighter.
