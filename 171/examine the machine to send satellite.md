The satellite sector makes the good point that it uses much less electricity for broadcast transmissions. Satellites in space use solar energy, while DTT transmission towers rely on terrestrially generated energy to transmit to consumers. Nevertheless, that energy consumption and related carbon emission is only a small part of the picture.

Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.

## A machine learning breakthrough: Using satellite images to improve 
Jul 20, 2021Now, a team based at UC Berkeley has devised a machine learning system to tap the problem-solving potential of satellite imaging, using low-cost, easy-to-use technology that could bring access and analytical power to researchers and governments worldwide. The study, "A generalizable and accessible approach to machine learning with global satellite imagery," was published today (Tuesday, July

## Choosing a SEND Device | West Marine
A SEND uses commercial satellite systems, rather than the international Cospas-Sarsat satellite system, to transmit GPS location-based distress calls, tracking messages and check in with family. Since SEND devices transmit over commercial satellite systems they require a subscription plan.  Send and receive free-form 160 character text messages.
