Crushing setting: Efficiency. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6:1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 per cent versus the discharge size that passes 80 per cent.

## Crushing Circuit - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The first step of physical beneficiation is crushing and grinding the iron ore to its liberation size, the maximum size where individual particles of gangue are separated from the iron minerals. A flow sheet of a typical iron ore crushing and grinding circuit is shown in Figure 1.2.2 (based on Ref. [4]).This type of flow sheet is usually followed when the crude ore contains below 30% iron.
