## metamorphic rock - Pressure | Britannica
The pressure experienced by a rock during metamorphism is due primarily to the weight of the overlying rocks (i.e., lithostatic pressure) and is generally reported in units of bars or kilobars. The standard scientific notation for pressure is expressed in pascals or megapascals (1 pascal is equivalent to 10 bars). For typical densities of crustal rocks of two to three grams per cubic

There is only the shaping of the rock till it reaches the zone where the displacement is large enough. The investigation of the maximum crushing force shows the same tendencies than the known effects on smaller particles (Schönert, 1984, Szczelina, 2000, p. 74). The projection area related crushing force decreases with the particle diameter.
