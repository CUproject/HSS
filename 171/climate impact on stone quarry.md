Surprisingly, reliable data on their extraction in certain developed countries are available only for recent years. Sand was until recently extracted in land quarries and riverbeds; however, a shift to marine and coastal aggregates mining has occurred due to the decline of inland resources.

Impacts on Forest Growth and Productivity. Many aspects related to climate change are likely to affect forest growth and productivity. Three examples are described below: increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, and increases in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Warming temperatures generally increase the length of the growing season.

Early Paleoindian toolkits have superbly made artifacts of chipped stone and carved bone—projectile points, scraping and engraving tools, cutting tools known to archaeologists as spokeshaves, and toward the end of the period, axlike adzes. Stone tools, particularly early in the period, were commonly made of the highest-quality materials.

## Quarrying and Mineral Extraction - What effect can Quarries have 
Whilst a quarry is in use the effects on the local environment are more than just the loss of wildlife habitats and the obvious visual impact. A working quarry needs methods of transportation and this means that large amounts of machinery and heavy traffic will be brought into the area, causing an increase in local noise, pollution and erosion.

Abstract. The study aimed at assessing the distribution and composition of dust produced at Pomona Stone Quarry mine in Harare, Zimbabwe. The source contribution to ambient PM 2.5 and PM 10 dust levels were quantified and their spatial distribution from the quarry to the receptor (community). The study also analysed the pH of soils around the mine, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 levels in quarry dust.

Well, it's because the campaign to protect Stonehenge World Heritage Site - particularly from damage by local road expansion - raises big issues about how we look after the climate, air quality, our landscape, our heritage and our future. Transport is now officially the biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.

## Impact of Air Pollution from Quarrying and Stone Cutting Industries on 
More than 300 quarries and 1000 stone cutting industries are exist in Palestine, with a total annual yield of 100 million tons of raw stone and 25 million square meters of good stone. Unfortunately, this industry is usually associated with air pollution. To assess the impact of such action on agriculture and plant biodiversity, two methods including measurement of the particulate matters (PM
