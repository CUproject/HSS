The resultant silver chloride was then picked up by adding mercury. This inefficient method was superseded by the von Patera process.

Historic Gold Mining Method for Processing Ore. An arrastra, also known as a Mexican Rastra, was a primitive method used by early miners to process gold and silver ores. It was introduced to the new world by the Spanish in the 1500's. They were used throughout the world, often at remote locations where other processing methods were not feasible.

The ore is transferred to underground rock crushers. Crushed ore is then hoisted up to the surface or driven by truck via a spiral tunnel or decline ramp. On the surface, the ore is crushed even finer and then ground. A flotation process separates silver-bearing galena from waste rock particles called tailings.
