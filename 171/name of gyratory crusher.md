## Different types of crushing equipments - Constro Facilitator
Gyratory crusher. Gyratory crushers are principally used in surface-crushing plants. The gyratory crusher consists essentially of a long spindle, carrying a hard steel conical grinding element, the head, seated in an eccentric sleeve. The spindle is suspended from a "spider" and, as it rotates, normally between 85 and 150 rpm, it sweeps out

## Crusher
A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap
