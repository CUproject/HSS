Thus it is crucial to control the adverse effects of blasting. 1. Factors Affecting Vibration. When a controlled blast is fired, the vibration level is controlled by two principal factors, distance and charge size. Obviously, it is safer to be far away from a blast than to be near it. 2. Safe Limits of Vibration.
