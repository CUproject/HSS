## Standard Test Method for The Determination of Bulk Density
The bulk density is more in compacted state as compared to the loose which shows that the bulk density greatly depends on the degree of compaction or how densely it is packed.; Usually increase in bulk density should be above 15% for coarse aggregate and should be below 15% for fine aggregate, But in our results it is 11.20% for fine aggregate and 11.48% for coarse aggregate.

Experiment 2 How Dense Is It? An Introduction to Concrete Density and Aggregates Objective: The objective of this experiment is to determine the density of a concrete sample and to learn the effect of various types of aggregates on concrete's density. Scientific Principles: Density is the physical property of matter that measures the quantity of a substance per unit of space.

## Exp 5 Bulk Density - Civil Engineers PK
This test method is used to determine the bulk density of the given fine grained specimen. During the concrete mix design, when the aggregate is to be batched by volume or by weight, then it becomes necessary to know the mass of the aggregates that will fill the container of unit volume. If we know the bulk density of the aggregate material

Aggregates Testing. Aggregates make up the largest volume (66% to 78%) of material used in concrete. The aggregates must be clean, properly graded, hard, strong, durable, and free from chemicals or coatings of clay or other foreign materials that may inhibit the bond between the cement and aggregate. Testing must be performed to make sure that
