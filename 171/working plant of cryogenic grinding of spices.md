## Advance Technology for Spices Grinding- A Review
The main aim of this review is to summarize the knowledge of size reduction theory in grinding, working and importance of cryogenic grinding over convention method. Conventional grinding methods can be used to grind the species, but the problem of increase in the temperatures during grinding may lose the volatile oil compounds, natural flavour and aroma. But, in cryogenic grinding those

## Cryogenic Grinding of Spices Preserves Essential Oils
Cryogenic Technology grinds spices and herbs at a sub-zero temperature. i.e., from 0 degree to -196 degrees. It uses liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide. This helps to prevent the rising of temperature during the grinding process. The cryogenic grinding of powders gives you finer, better quality products with higher throughput.
