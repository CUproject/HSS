## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

## What Does Copper Ore Look Like - Realonomics
Mar 2, 2022How can you tell copper ore? In addition search for rocks that are green or pieces of ore that have green flecks. The green hue is characteristic of copper. Remove samples of the rocks and take them back to the lab for testing. If the rocks have a high part per million count of copper then you may have found a copper deposit.
