Teus Tuinenburg. First of all, a belt conveyor is a volume transporting device. The rate is calculated as : Volume = cross-section x velocity. The conveyed mass is then known by multiplying the volume rate by the density. You can change the spreadsheet calculation, where the only factor is mass flow.

## Technical solutions for conveyor roller performance - Quarry
Most rollers are selected on the basis of theoretical bearing life calculations, based mainly on load and speed. Idler life is determined by many factors, such as seals, bearings, shell thickness, belt speed, lump size/material density, maintenance, environment, temperature and the idler design that handles the maximum calculated idler load.

## Modeling and calculation of the powered roller conveyor
Powered roller conveyor is used as a segment of transport handling system within the warehouse. A model of this conveyor was developed using Autodesk Inventor Professional 3D CAD software.  The concept of calculations was adopted according to the procedures defined in the standards and recommendations. The goal was for adopted design to be
