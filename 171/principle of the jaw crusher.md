Mar 20, 2021The working principle of jaw crusher is very simple. The whole crushing process rely on the relative motion of the two jaw plates. One of the jaw plates stay still while the other move against it. And with the movement, the materials between the two plates would be crushed into small elements. While the plates move against each other, the

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate. The space at the bottom of the "V"-aligned jaw plates is the output gap that dictates the size of the crushed product from the jaw crusher.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - StudiousGuy
A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The movement of the jaw crusher is

All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
