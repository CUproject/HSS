## Transesterification of Methyl-10-undecenoate and Poly(ethylene adipate 
Selective removal from model polymer waste streams is possible. In our approach, the initial polymers result from polycondensation of long-chain building blocks, derived by state-of-the-art catalytic schemes from common plant oil feedstocks, or microalgae oils(15). This allows closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials.
