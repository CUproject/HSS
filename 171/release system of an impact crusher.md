 The spring release system of a cone crusher acts as an overload protection that allows tramp to pass through the crushing chamber without damage to the crusher. The cone crusher can be divided into four subtypes: compound crusher, css cone crusher, single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, and the multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher.

The three types of crushers most commonly used for crushing CDW materials are the jaw crusher, the impact crusher and the gyratory crusher (Figure 4.4).A jaw crusher consists of two plates, with one oscillating back and forth against the other at a fixed angle (Figure 4.4(a)) and it is the most widely used in primary crushing stages (Behera et al., 2014).

Impact Crusher Working Principle. E1 = crushing pendulum potential energy (before release) KE = kinetic energy of the two platens E2 = rebound pendulum maximum potential energy (after crushing) EL = system energy loss (sound, heat, vibration) The system energy loss, EL, is determined by plotting EL as a function of the initial height of the crushing pendulum with no rock present.
