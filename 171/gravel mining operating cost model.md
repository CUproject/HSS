gravel will often be blamed on the maintenance operator. But the operator cannot make good gravel out of bad gravel. Bad or poorly graded gravel can not be changed to good gravel without additional costs, but it is often well worth it. One common practice of improving surface gravel is to add new, clean, fine gravel. Good surface gravel. Get Price
