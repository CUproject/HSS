Source: "A Brief History of Bearings" by JVN Bearings FZE via YouTube 2600 BC - Ancient Egyptians used a form of roller bearings to assist in moving large stone pieces that were for the construction of the Pyramids.. 40 BC - An early known example of a wooden ball bearing was used to support a rotating table. This example was found in the remains of a sunken Roman ship in Lake Nemi, Italy.

An automobile ball joint is a pivoting element used to allow rotational motion between the parts of the steering and suspension systems. Depending on the car development, in general, most automobile ball joints are made of a socket, bearing, plug, and ball stud. The manufacturing process assembling these parts is called the caulking process.

## Ball Bearings Selection Guide: Types, Features, Applications 
Ball bearings are able to provide high performance and long lifetime in order to transfer the load from the balls to the inner races. The balls have minimal contact with the inner and outer races due to their spherical shape and this allows them to spin smoothly. A disadvantage of ball bearings is that the balls can become "flattened" over time

Bearings are machine elements which are used to support a rotating member viz., a shaft. They transmit the load from a rotating member to a stationary member known as frame or housing. They permit relative motion of two members in one or two directions with minimum friction, and also prevent the motion in the direction of the applied load.

Steel ball bearings are ideal for robust applications handling extremely high loads and fast rotations per minute (RPMs), and some feature a radial load capacity of up to 30,000 pounds. Another advantage of steel ball bearings is that they tend to be very precise due to the clearance that can be achieved during the manufacturing process.

## Bearing Races Manufacturer - Hartford Technologies
Hartford's bearing parts, particularly races, are typically manufactured from a forged blank or pipe / tube stock. The part is then machined and ground to precise ID, OD and width. Bearing races must withstand the high loading imparted by the rolling elements. This loading is theoretically a point in ball bearings and a line in roller bearings.
