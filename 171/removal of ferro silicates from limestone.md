The removal of silica and magnesia to certain specified limits can make them suitable for cement manufacture. Magnesia can be removed by a carbonation process after semi-calcination of dolomite but the removal of a large amount of silica prior to MgO separation, by the flotation process alone, is uneconomical.

Ionic silica is much smaller sized than colloidal silica and due to this, mechanical removal techniques such as flocculation, clarification, filtration and flotation are not an effective removal process. Technologies that allow removing silica are brackish or tap water reverse osmosis, Electrodeionization, Mixed Bed Deionizers or Ion Exchange.
