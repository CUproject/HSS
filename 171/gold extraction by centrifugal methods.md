## Summary of Gold Gravity Separation
1. Gold Gravity Separation Principle. Gold gravity separation refers to the gold extraction and separation process making use of different moving speed and direction of mineral with different particle sizes, traits and proportion under the combined action of gravity, centrifugal force, medium resistance and mechanical resistance.. Gold gravity separation is the oldest gold extraction process.

A process for extracting a component from liquids using dense phase gases or supercritical fluids (dense phase solvent). The process contacts a liquid and the dense phase solvent in a rotating mixer (18) to dissolve a desired fraction into the dense phase solvent to form a loaded solvent. Furthermore, the mixer separates the loaded solvent from the remaining raffinate.

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

## Gold Extraction Process Methods Summary - JXSC Machine
R-OH+Au (CN)2-═R-Au (CN)2+OH-. Gold extraction process flow. (1) Adsorption: When the gold-containing cyanide solution passes through the exchange resin column, an ion exchange reaction occurs, and gold is adsorbed on the resin. (2) Desorption: Desorbing the gold on the resin into the solution with a desorbent.
