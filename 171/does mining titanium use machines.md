## Titanium Cutting - AP Precision Metals, Inc.
Plasma Cutting for Titanium. Titanium can also be cut using a plasma torch or plasma CNC machine. Plasma cutting is extremely versatile, and can be especially useful for hard-to-reach angles or parts that do easily not fit on a bench or on a CNC bed. At AP Precision, we execute this technique using special gases to help ensure a clean cut.
