## Ore
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Records of small-scale copper production date back to 1908 and 1911, when mining took place at Kansanshi and Bwana Mkubwa mines, respectively. Almost 100 years has passed since sustained commercial-scale mining began in Zambia, when extensive exploration projects led to the discovery of substantial copper deposits in the 1920s.

Zambia is the eighth largest copper producer in the world. USGS assessments estimated that the potential for undiscovered copper deposits in Zambia is larger than once thought.  Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals
