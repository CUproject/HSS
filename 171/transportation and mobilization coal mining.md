Coal slurry is a mixture of crushed coal and a liquid such as water or oil. The traditional mixture, first patented in England in 1891, consists of 50 percent coal and 50 percent water by weight. So-called heavy coal slurries or slurry fuels consist of 65 to 75 percent coal, with the remainder being water, methanol, or oil.

Reclamation of surface mines in Texas became mandatory in 1978, requiring that overburden removed during surface mining (mine spoils) be emplaced in open mine pits and land surface reshaped to pre-mining topography. The reclaimed land surface then is revegetated to control erosion. Shallow ground-water-flow systems that develop in reclaimed areas have geochemical characteristics substantially

Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

In 2019, the average transportation cost of coal was $15.03 per ton, down from $16.07 per ton in 2018. Transportation costs accounted for about 40% of the total delivered cost of coal in 2019, down 1% compared with the previous year. In the past 10 years, coal commodity costs have fallen faster than transportation costs.
