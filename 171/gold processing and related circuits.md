## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Integrated circuit
An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) integrate into a small chip.This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller

Water is then added to the process to create a mud-like slurry that is pumped into a thickener where gold-bearing particles sink to the bottom and are passed to downstream processing. Typically, the next processing phase is a CIL, CIP or CIC circuit. All these methods use cyanide and activated carbon to extract the gold from the slurry.

Heap leaching allows generation of revenue early in the life of a project to help delay large capital investments required for milling and additional mining operations. Gold recovery from heap leaches is typically ~70 %, although it can range from 50 to 90 %, whereas silver recovery is typically ~55 %.
