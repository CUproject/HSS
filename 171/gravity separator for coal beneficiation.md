## Low gravity separation—Key to beneficiation of Illinois Coal
The purpose of this paper was to present, in a brief form, the research studies conducted during the past 10 years by the Inland Steel Co. on the beneficiation of Illinois No. 6 coal. This research effort resulted in the design of a preparation plant which, when completed, will be capable of producing a 5.5% ash metallurgical coal from the Illinois No. 6 seam coal. In order to cover the 10
