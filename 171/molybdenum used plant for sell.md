## 11 - Sources and Methods for Molybdenum Fertilization of Crops
Molybdenum Sources. There are fewer sources of Mo for fertilizers than there are for the other micronutrients (Table 11.1). Ammonium and sodium molybdates and molybdic acid are soluble compounds. These sources of Mo are sometimes applied with other fertilizers or are used as foliar sprays. Both MoO 3 a nd Mo frits are insoluble in water, but

## Molybdenum Deficiency in Cannabis - Premium Cultivars
This prevents your plants from absorbing Molybdenum. Using a soil-based system, the pH level should be between 6.0 and 7.0 for the best molybdenum absorption. Most gardeners will even avoid pH levels below 6.5 if they suspect a deficiency of Molybdenum. If you are growing plants in hydroponics, keep the pH between 5.5 and 6.5.

## Molybdenum Mining and Processing - IMOA
Molybdenum mining & processing. Molybdenum mining and processing techniques have been improved continuously since the first mine was started at Climax near Leadville, Colorado in 1916. Today, the principal moly mines, both primary and by-product, are found along the Great Continental Divide of the Americas, in China and in the CIS.
