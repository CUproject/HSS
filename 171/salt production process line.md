## Pag91 - Salt production and distribution
The company Pag 91 Ltd is an important Croatian salt producer, distributor and salt supplier founded in 1991. The company's headquarters is located in Pag, which is no coincidence, because Pag has been an important location for sea salt production since ancient times. Since the 10th century, Pag has had the most northerly salt pan in Croatia.

## Ever Wonder How Is Sea Salt Made? - Baker and Baker Salts
Making sea salt is actually a simple process but it can be quite time-consuming. Looking into history, the production of salt was from back prehistoric times. That's why salt production is one of the oldest chemical practices performed by humans. The first step to prepare sea salt is to evaporate the seawater. It is as simple as that.

Today there are three main methods for obtaining salt: Evaporation from sea water. Mining salt from the earth. Creating salt brines. Most common table salts are a product of salt brines, while specialty or gourmet salts are still produced via evaporation of seawater; salts used for industrial purposes are obtained through mining.

Jun 15, 2021We chose salinities of 3 and 15% because the fresh salt concentration entering into the sea salt production line has a salinity of 3-4%, and the salt concentration is subsequently enriched to 15-20% through evaporation processes as depicted in Fig. 1. The mixture was stirred for 3 h to completely dissolve the sea salt in DI water.

## Salt Production and Processing - Morton Salt
Another method of salt production used by Morton Salt is the evaporation of salt brine by steam heat in large commercial evaporators, called vacuum pans. This method yields a very high purity salt, fine in texture, and principally used in those applications requiring the highest quality salt. The first part of the operation is known as solution
