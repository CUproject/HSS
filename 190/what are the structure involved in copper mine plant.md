## Mining Management Hierarchy | Mining Management Plans - Hierarchy Structure
Mining Management Hierarchy. Mining refers to the act of extracting valuable minerals and/ or other materials from the depth of the earth. Naturally these minerals/ materials have a lot of value, and the most common materials mined across the globe include- coal, metals like gold etc., oil, limestone, gemstones, clay etc.

Since plants require nutrients in the form of elements such as carbon and potassium, it is important to understand the chemical composition of plants. The majority of volume in a plant cell is water; it typically comprises 80 to 90 percent of the plant's total weight.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

## Copper Mining Devastated Montana. Now An Industry Comeback  - HuffPost
The Vancouver, Canada-based firm, formerly Tintina Resources, is in the final stages of permitting to extract some 15 million tons of copper-rich rock from the "Johnny Lee" deposit. The proposed $250 million Black Butte Copper Project would be the first new copper mine to open in Montana in more than 40 years.

## Metagenome-scale analysis yields insights into the structure and 
Metagenomics allows us to acquire the potential resources from both cultivatable and uncultivable microorganisms in the environment. Here, shotgun metagenome sequencing was used to investigate microbial communities from the surface layer of low grade copper tailings that were industrially bioleached at the Dexing Copper Mine, China. A bioinformatics analysis was further performed to elucidate
