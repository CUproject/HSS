At the same time, the 1800s saw a great deal of British capital investment in overseas mining ventures. These British-owned mining operations recruited their skilled labour from Cornwall and by the mid-1820s, Cornish miners, or "Cousin Jacks" as they were called, were to be found all across Latin America sinking shafts and developing mines.

## Black Warrior Riverkeeper - Coal Mining
There are around 95 active coal mines located in the Black Warrior River watershed. Strip mining (a.k.a. surface mining) and longwall mining (a.k.a. underground mining) are the methods of choice for coal extraction in Alabama. As a result, many Black Warrior streams are impaired by sediment laden with heavy metals.
