## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Achieving Safe Limestone Mining | Engineer Live
By adding a 2500 SM Vario, the company was able to mine a total of 32,000m³ of limestone in 2018 - a significant increase from the 22,000m³ mined in 2017. The 2500 SM Vario is particularly suitable for hard rock, as is the case in Ube. Thanks to the central-drum concept, the drum is located very close to the centre of gravity of the 135-ton
