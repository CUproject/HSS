## Potassium hydroxide solution absorbs carbon dioxide
Potassium carbonate is a good solvent for carbon dioxide capture because of its low regeneration energy, low degradation rates and low corrosivity. However, one shortcoming of potassium carbonate in CO 2 absorption is that it has relatively slow reaction kinetics with CO 2 resulting in the need for large absorption equipment.

!! VERY LONG ANSWER !! Part (i) Start with the balanced chemical equation for the reaction that takes place between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid CaCO_(3(s)) + 2HCl_((aq)) -> CaCl_(2(aq)) + CO_(2(g)) + H_2O_((l)) Even before doing any calculations, you can predict that not all the HCl will be consumed by the reaction, since you need to determine the concentration of the H^(+) ions

It is also used in cement, is converted to quick-lime (calcium oxide) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). Ground calcium carbonate is slightly basic and can be used to neutralize combustion vapors or increase the pH in water or soils. Pure calcium carbonate is a relatively soft mineral/compound, with a Mohs hardness of 2.5 - 3.0.

The CO2 (actually carbonic acid, H2CO3) reacts with the calcium carbonate in solution, forming the bicarbonate, and shifts the equilibrium, allowing more solid calcium carbonate to dissolve and so on. If enough CO2 is present, a lot of CaCO3 can dissolve. My well water has 430 ppm CaCO3 hardness.

Metal carbonate compounds react with dilute acids and emit carbon dioxide gas. Balanced chemical equation of CaCO 3 and HCl reaction with physical states CaCO 3(s) + 2HCl (aq) → CaCl 2(aq) + CO 2(g) + H 2 O (l). Calcium carbonate is not soluble in water and exists as white precipitate in the water. When aqueous hydrochloric acid is added, calcium chloride, carbon dioxide and water are formed.

## Hydrochloric Acid Lab Report - 876 Words | Internet Public Library
Hydrochloric Acid Lab Report. Within the current investigation, the effects of the surface area of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) in combination with Hydrochloric acid (HCl) upon its rate of reaction. CaCO3, commonly referred to as limestone, is an organic substance and is, in a sense, the crystallised "carbonic salt" of the element, calcium2.

Calcium carbonate Wikipedia. Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca CO 3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs.Calcium carbonate is the active
