The three pertinent equations are: T0 = 4.20 Si (Wb + Wm) for 3% sag. T0 = 6.25 Si (Wb + Wm) for 2% sag. T0 = 8.40 Si (Wb + Wm) for 1.5% sag. In these equations, Si is idler spacing in feet, Wb is a weight per foot of the belt, and Wm is a weight per foot of the material. After calculating T 0 it is essential to add or subtract the weight of

## How to Calculate Load Carrying Capacity of Conveyor Rollers?
Calculating load on conveyor roller is simple arithmetic and very easy. Assume that you have to design a Gravity Roller Conveyor System for carton box conveying. Weight of the carton box is 50kg Length of the box is 400mm Width of the box is 300mm Lets Calculate width of the rollers = width of the carton box + 50mm So Roller length is 350mm Now we have to decide how many rollers will be below

## Belt Length Calculator
Belt length = ( (D L + D S)  π / 2) + (2  L) + (D L - D S) 2 / (4  L) where: D L is the diameter of the large pulley; D S is the diameter of the smaller pulley; and. L is the distance between the pulley axles. You can find the belt length calculated with this equation by clicking on the Advanced mode button.
