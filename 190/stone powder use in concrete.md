## Concrete - Minecraft Wiki
Concrete is a solid block available in the 16 regular dye colors. Concrete requires a pickaxe to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Concrete is formed when concrete powder comes into contact with a block of water (source block, flowing or waterlogged). It is not formed by contact with rain, filled cauldrons or water bottles. The bright and solid colors of concrete make

There are different types of stone dust available, in terms of both the stone from which it originates and the coarseness of the powder. There are pros and cons to using stone dust for paving compared to using sand. Many landscapers prefer to use sand with concrete as the base material and to use stone dust only for between the paving stones.
