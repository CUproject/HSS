## The History of the Milling Machine: How It Became Indispensable
Before the milling machine, a machinist mainly used files as tools and this required a highly skilled worker. The milling machine now made it possible for a less skilled labourer to produce quality parts. A century and a half later: the arrival of CNC milling machines. As with the first milling machine in history, the first CNC-controlled
