Ball Mill PINION SHAFT BEARINGS. Pinion shaft bearings are of the SKF anti-friction type mounted in a common twin bearing assembly. Bearings are fixed in place so that the pinion shaft of the mill is always in alignment with the drive components. V-belt driven mills are furnished with an outboard bearing of similar construction.

## bearings used on ball mills
May 17, 2017Â· The axial bearings used in these mills are angular contact ball bearings or deep groove ball bearings. In back-up rolls for large four-high hot strip mills, a deep groove ball bearing is often sufficient as an axial bearing. It generally has the same section height as the radial cylindrical roller bearing to which it is allocated.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.
