## Potential of Granite Dust to Improve the Engineering Properties of Soft 
Soft soils such as clay soils, mostly if they comprise swelling minerals may produce great damage to structures, particularly when these soils are exposed to wetting and drying situations. The geotechnical properties of soft soils could be enhanced by utilizing chemical additives. In this paper, granite waste dust was used to adjust the properties of clay soils.

## Uses of Granite - Introduction, Formation, Different Properties, Uses 
The Chemical Properties of this Stone are: Granite is an example of igneous rock and it, therefore, contains the most amount of silica in its core component that is made up of 70 to 77 % of silica. Alumina is also present in granite in 11 to 14 % of its chemical composition. Potassium oxide and soda make up about 3 to 5 % of their composition.

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ɪ t / (UK) or / ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t / (US) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.
