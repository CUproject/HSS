This method of separation is used when either the ore particles or the gangue associated with it possess magnetic properties. For example, chromite Fe(CrO 2) 2 being magnetic can be separated from the non-magnetic silicious gangue by magnetic separation.. This method is widely used for the separation of two minerals, when one of them happens to be magnetic.

This rudimentary piece of mineral processing equipment uses pulses of water to suspend the particles in water. As the pulses dissipate, the particles settle in the bottom of the jig. Particles with a higher specific gravity (like gold) settle faster than those with a lower specific gravity, effectively separating the gold so it can be collected.
