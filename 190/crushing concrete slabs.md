## Concrete Crush - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Similar to the NSC slab, concrete crush on the top surface was also observed and such failure was caused by the formation of the plastic hinge.  For over-reinforced beams, concrete crushing is the primary contribution to the failure of the beams (Nanni and Tanigaki, 1992).

## How Thick Should Concrete Slabs Be? - Home Inspection Insider
Sep 21, 2021Crusher run; 1. Concrete Slab Over a Dirt Base. It is possible to pour concrete slabs over a dirt base even though it is not advisable. That is because the dirt base will become unstable over time due to the strength of the concrete slab. And when that happens, the concrete slab may settle and begin to crack. However, you can still do that.

## Concrete Crushing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.

## Subgrades & Subbases for Concrete Slabs - Concrete Network
Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
