## Chrome Ore Beneficiation Process | Chromite Processing - JXSC Mining
The density of chromite ore is slightly higher than that of its other magnetic gangue ore. Therefore, the separation of ferrochromium from other minerals can be realized by gravity separation. Use spiral chute to separate the concentrate process tailings and the scavenging process concentrate respectively.

Dec 8, 2020Therefore, Pb-Zn ore could be sufficiently pre-concentrated by magnetic separation between 0.65 and 0.85 T to remove low-grade target elements. As a result, the mass of the sample fed into the flotation system was reduced almost by half, and the grade of zinc, lead, and copper was enhanced by 65%, 55%, and 33%, respectively.

## The ore that can be concentrated by magnetic separation method is 
Answer: If the ore or the gangue can be attracted by the magnetic field, then the ore can be concentrated by the process of magnetic separation. Ores of iron such as haematite (Fe₂O₃), magnetite (Fe₃O₄), siderite (FeCO₃), and iron pyrites (FeS₂) can be separated by the process of magnetic separation. Advertisement.
