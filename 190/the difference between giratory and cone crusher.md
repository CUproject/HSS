## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.
