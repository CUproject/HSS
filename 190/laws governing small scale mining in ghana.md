## Gold Mining as Subsistence: Ghana's Small-Scale Miners Left Behind
The government completely legalized small-scale gold mining in 1989 in a reactionary move after realizing that as much as 20 percent of gold output was being lost through unmonitored small-scale mining channels. But the operating climate has been as unattractive for small-scale miners as it has been favorable for large-scale miners.

Ghana's small-scale mining sector faces complex challenges, including environmental degradation and pollution, loss of life and increased health risks, despite several years of implementation of small-scale mining laws. These challenges, generally, are known to have escalated because of illegal small-scale mining, locally known as "galamsey". Despite the illegal status of this category

The causes are many, but illegal artisanal and small-scale mining is a major theme. The current government, which came into power at the peak of the crisis in 2017, took steps to deal with the issue by banning galamsey and ASM activities, and setting up an Inter-Ministerial Committee to develop appropriate regulations.
