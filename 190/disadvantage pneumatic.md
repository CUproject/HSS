Pneumatics takes advantages of the low friction, compressible nature of air. A lot of air can be moved rapidly, and although compressibility needs to be factored in, it can provide an advantage with unmatched response and cycle times. Most pneumatic applications are low inertia, so they tend to accelerate and decelerate quickly.

## The Advantages of Pneumatic Systems - Best Pneumatics
Pneumatic systems offer a number of distinctive advantages, including: Efficient - The atmosphere contains an unlimited supply of air for the production of compressed air, which can be easily stored in large volumes. Not only can compressed air be easily transported through pipes but after it's been used it can be released directly into the

## Advanced Electropneumatic Positioning Achieves Dynamic Force Control 
Oct 20, 2021There is one disadvantage: An EPS cannot be perfectly sealed, so an incremental or intermittent loss of air or pressure is unavoidable. Minor leaks can cause the pneumatic cylinder to move slightly (drift). Low air flow can cause the cylinder to begin undergoing stiction, or chatter, which degrades system accuracy and performance.
