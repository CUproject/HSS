What Is Coal Preparation? • Coal preparation is the removal of undesirable material from the Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal by employing separation processes which are able to differentiate between the physical and surface properties of the coal and the impurities. Through coal preparation, a uniform product is achieved.

Crushing is often one of the first steps in the production of rock, coal, and other minerals, as mined material can consist of boulders that are too big to fit through the processing plant.  Often the sheer crushing is combined with other crushing methods, such as compression, attrition, and impact, for mineral size reduction. For example

There are two main methods of extracting coal by underground mining: room-and-pillar (or, bord-and-pillar) and longwall mining. Room-and-pillar mining involves cutting a network of 'rooms' or panels into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. Initially, recoveries are reduced (to 50-60 per cent
