Minergy Coal Chief Executive Officer, Andre Boje says developing African countries including Botswana should be allowed to mine fossil fuels. Speaking at the 16th annual Botswana resource sector conference on Wednesday, Boje said developed countries were built on the back of fossil fuels and thus, it would be unfair for them to deny developing countries the opportunity of doing the same.
