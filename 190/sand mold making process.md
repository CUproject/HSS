## Sand Casting For Manufacture - Manufacturing Process
In fact, sand casting is one of the few processes that can be used for metals with high melting temperatures such as steels, nickel, and titanium. Usually sand used to manufacture a mold for the casting process is held together by a mixture of water and clay. A typical mixture by volume could be 89% sand, 4% water, 7% clay.

Die casting can also produce features that cannot be made in sand casting, reducing the secondary costs over sand. If your company is a high-volume producer of products with a long service life (casting runs of 1,000 or more), the die casting process is most likely going to be the right choice over sand casting.

As the iron travels down the molding line, the temperature gradually decreases from about 1,200 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature at this stage varies based on the size of the casting as well as the molding rate. At the end of the mold line, castings enter a shakeout process where the molds are shaken off and the sand is recycled for reuse.

Sand is packed around the pattern to form a mold impression. This is much like making footprints on wet beach sand. In fact a rough casting could be made by pouring plaster directly into the impression in the sand. After the mold is packed, the pattern is removed and molten bronze is poured into the finished mold to form the casting.

Metal casting is the process in which molten metal is poured into a mold and allowed to solidify into an object. The object that results from this process is also called a casting. In sand casting, sand is used to define the cavity inside a mold. In addition, sand is used to make any cores that are contained in the mold.

Mold-making - The first step in the sand casting process is to create the mold for the casting. In an expendable mold process, this step must be performed for each casting. A sand mold is formed by packing sand into each half of the mold. The sand is packed around the pattern, which is a replica of the external shape of the casting.
