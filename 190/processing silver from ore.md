The processing stone must be full durability to use. Durability is not used when using a processing stone, this simply means you must fully repair the max durability after enhancing to be able to use the stone. I recommend buying a cheap Loggia Processing stone (costs 1 million silver) from Camellia Loggia or Zaaira. Even with low processing

## How To Find Silver In The Ground - Realonomics
Feb 16, 2022What does silver look like in ground? Look for rocks that have either a rough dark gray to sooty black look or a silvery metallic look. . Rich silver deposits are found in rocks with a mixture of red pink and dark sooty crystals. The silver is in the dark crystals while the red and pink crystals are a manganese mineral called rhodochrosite.

Feb 18, 2022Ore processing. Silver is commonly extracted from the powdered ore by smelting or chemical leaching. . This is done by dissolving a gold alloy (less than 30% gold) and boiling with 30% nitric acid. Affination is the process of boiling silver and gold with concentrated sulfuric acid. This separates the silver and gold.
