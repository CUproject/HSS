## Gabon's Ancient Nuclear Reactor | Amusing Planet
Such a natural reactor was discovered sixteen years later, in 1972, in Gabon. At that time the French had been mining uranium in Gabon—a former French colony—for use in nuclear power plants. During a routine measurement of uranium ore from a mine in Oklo, in southeastern Gabon, the French noticed that the uranium-235 content in the ore was

McArthur River is also considered to be the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world. McArthur River uranium deposit was discovered in 1988 and mining began in 1999. It's proven and probable reserves as of December 2012 were 1.05 million tonnes of ore grading 16.36% uranium. Cameco operates the mine with a working interest of 69.8%.

## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

## Manganese | History, Uses, Facts, Physical & Chemical Characteristics
Physical Characteristics. Manganese is a greyish-pink metal. It resembles iron in its physical appearance. It is brittle and hard. Manganese has a paramagnetic nature. when exposed to air and moisture, it undergoes slow oxidation that leads to rusting. Manganese is a dense metal, with a density of 7. 43 g.cm- 3 at room temperature.
