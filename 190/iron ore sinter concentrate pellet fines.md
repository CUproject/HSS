## Sinter plant
Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature, to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.The final product, a sinter, is a small, irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called sintering, causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical

Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite

## What is iron ore pelletization?m.youramys
Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.  The process of pelletizing combines mixing of the raw material, forming the pellet and a thermal treatment baking the soft raw pellet to hard spheres.

## Pellet, iron ore concentrste, sintered iron ore: buy from Metinvest 
Iron ore pellets are produced from the iron ore concentrate by pelletizing and sintering and are used as the feedstock for the blast furnace process. Metinvest offers a range of iron ore pellets for the blast furnace process, such as non-fluxed pellets produced by Central GOK with a basicity of 0.1. and 65.5% iron content, non-fluxed pellets

## Intensive reduction of fuel consumption in the sintering process of 
Experimental results of ore blends containing 24%-36% specularite concentrate showed that pre-briqutting process made specularite into larger particles alone instead of distributing in sintering
