## Drilling
Drilling is a cutting process that uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular cross-section in solid materials. The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool, often multi-point.The bit is pressed against the work-piece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute.This forces the cutting edge against the work-piece, cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it is
