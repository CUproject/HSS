## Different Types of Secondary Rock Crusher
Gyratory crusher is a type of secondary rock crusher. There is a narrow opening at the bottom of gyratory crusher. Only if the stone is crushed into desired shape, it can fall through the opening. The gyratory crusher break down stones by pressing between two components--an eccentrically-gyrating spindle and an enclosing concave hopper.

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
