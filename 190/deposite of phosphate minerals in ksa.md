## Phosphate | Energy & Mining
Phosphate. Phosphate rock is a general term referring to rock with high concentrations of phosphate minerals, most commonly those of the apatite family with the general formula Ca 5 (PO 4 CO 3) 3 (F,OH,Cl). Ninety percent of phosphate mined is used to produce chemical fertilisers. Phosphorus is one of the three major nutrients required by

Phosphate ores are the only pronounced source of phosphorus. As a crucial component with high economic importance, phosphorus remains indispensable in the phosphoric acid industry, fertilizers, and elemental phosphorus production. The demand on phosphate has increased throughout the years. A total of 47 million tons P2O5 were consumed worldwide

## Geophysics Applied to Phosphate Exploration in Northern Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS) has had a long involvement in Saudi Arabia, and initially identified phosphate deposits in northern Saudi Arabia in the early 1960's (Sheldon, 1965).
