## Bacteria Make Space Mining 400% More Effective | Space - Labroots
Nov 14, 2020Researchers aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that bacteria can increase space mining efficiency by more than 400%. Their findings pave the way for easier access to materials such as magnesium, iron, and rare Earth minerals while in space.

## Copper Mining Using Acidothiobacillus - microbewiki
Copper is not a metabolite of At. ferrooxidans, so the bacteria is not directly responsible for the solubilization of copper. Rather, it occurs through an abiotic reaction between the copper ores and the ferric ions and protons produced by the metabolic activities of the bacteria. These reactions regenerate the reduced iron and sulfur compounds

Microorganisms, mainly bacteria as mentioned above, are indigenous to the ARD environment. These microorganisms play a role in the direct and indirect oxidation of sulphur minerals (e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite). Normally, sulphur oxidizing bacteria are incorporated for extracting metals from ores in metallurgical processes.

How is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore. There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open, cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.
