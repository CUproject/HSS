## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

The post-primary crushing sector is largely divided into impact crushers for the processing of softer stone and cone crushers for the processing of harder, more abrasive stone. The advantages of both machines are well known. The impact crusher, for example, has a higher co-efficient of reduction, produces crushed material with an optimal cubic

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.
