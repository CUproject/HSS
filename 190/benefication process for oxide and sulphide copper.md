## copper sulfide ore beneficiation process protable plant
Jan 7, 2021Copper beneficiation process - Yantai Jinpeng . Copper ore divides into ore sulfide,ore oxide and mixing ore according to its oxide rate . The main process for copper ore is flotation, for refractory mixed copper ore and refractory oxide ore, normally use hydrometallurgy process .It is a high technological enterprise that integrated research, manufacture, sales and service .
