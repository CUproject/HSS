## Lightweight Concrete types and properties - Structural Guide
Share. Lightweight concrete is a mixture made with lightweight coarse aggregates. Low-weight aggregates such as shale, clay, shale, slate, volcanic pumice, ash, or perlite are used to reduce the density. Lightweight concrete is a special type of concrete made to be used for special purposes. It is not commonly used as normal-weight concrete.
