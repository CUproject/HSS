## Coal Fired Thermal Power Station Explained - saVRee
Coal is delivered to the plant via road, rail or ship, and deposited in a coal yard.Stacker reclaimers are used to gather coal and deposit it into hoppers, the hoppers then feed flatbed conveyors.Conveyors transport the coal from the coal yard to day silos within the main power station building. Each day silo contains enough coal for a set period of time when the power station is fully loaded
