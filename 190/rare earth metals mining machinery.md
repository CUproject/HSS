## REE - Rare Earth Elements - Metals, Minerals, Mining, Uses - Geology
Rare earth elements are a group of seventeen chemical elements that occur together in the periodic table (see image). The group consists of yttrium and the 15 lanthanide elements (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium).

## Rare earth elements: Where in the world are they?
Nov 23, 2021Rare earth elements are a group of metals that are critical ingredients for a greener economy, and the location of the reserves for mining are increasingly important and valuable.

## Rare-earth element
The rare-earth elements (REE), also called the rare-earth metals or (in context) rare-earth oxides or the lanthanides though yttrium and scandium, are a set of 17 nearly-indistinguishable lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Compounds containing rare earths have diverse applications in electrical and electronic components, lasers, glass, magnetic materials, and industrial processes.

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining
Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

## rare earth metals mining machinery
All of the stages of mining, refining, and disposal come with unique issues. Mining. The physical process of removing the ores from the ground is disruptive to the environment. Most rare earth elements are mined through open pit mining, which involves opening the surface of the earth using heavy equipment and machinery. Creating this disruption
