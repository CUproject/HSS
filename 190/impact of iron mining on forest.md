## Forest-Smart Mining : Identifying Factors Associated with the Impacts 
As an industry, mining plays an important role in more than 80 countries worldwide and, when managed well, contributes to many of the global development goals. However, when managed poorly, the sector can lead to various negative social, environmental, and economic impacts potentially occurring across the mining life cycle.

The environmental impacts from mining include: Destruction of natural habitat. Oil, fuel and chemicals spills contaminating surrounding soil, rivers and groundwater resources. Air pollution from mining processing operations. Drainage and runoff from mining sites, including acid mine drainage. Acid mine drainage can go on for thousands of years.

In Niger, artisanal gold mining contributes to the socioeconomic development for populations and government. It involves more than 450.000 persons who pay artisanal gold mining taxes and more than 2.700.000 peoples depend on it. Gold panning produces between two and ten tons of gold per year, which represents 2.90% of Niger mining sector exports.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

## iron mining impact on environment
However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. It degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water quality, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs. Iron ore tailings usually contain large amount of Silica, iron, and traces of Hg, Se, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn etc.

Longwall mining is a method of carving "hallways" into underground coal seams and then mining long corridors of coal adjacent to the hallway. As the coal is mined and carried away via conveyer belt to the surface, the ceiling above the mined coal collapses. This can cause subsidence on the surface.

## Iron ore mining in Saranda forest, JH, India | EJAtlas
Iron ore mining causes devastation of pristine Saranda forests which are home to over 36,000 adivasis (tribals), dense sal forests. The forests also house a large number of flora and fauna, and serve as an important elephant corridor.  The impact that the loss of forest has on adivasis can be gauged by the statement of a part time labourer

##  Forest and terrestrial ecosystem impacts of mining - Save the Boundary 
Studies of impacts of mining on various measures of environmental quality and reclamation, for cases with acid mine drainage, open-pit and underground iron mining, have been published for northern forests (Rayfield et al. 2005, Northwatch and Mining Watch Canada 2008, DeLong et al. 2012, Anawar et al. 2013).

## Amazon mining | WWF - Panda
Other effects include: Deforestation: In the Carajas Mineral Province, Brazil, maybe the world's largest copper reserve (iron ore, manganese and gold are already found there), wood from surrounding forest is cut for charcoal to fuel pig iron plants, resulting in annual deforestation of 6,100 km 21. Pollution: A notorious pollutant used in
