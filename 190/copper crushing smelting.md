Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

smelting, process by which a metal is obtained, either as the element or as a simple compound, from its ore by heating beyond the melting point, ordinarily in the presence of oxidizing agents, such as air, or reducing agents, such as coke. The first metal to be smelted in the ancient Middle East was probably copper (by 5000 bce), followed by tin, lead, and silver.

Jan 25, 2022Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## Copper Arsenic Smelting
Jan 3, 2021Smelting Copper Concentrates in an 800-Kva Electric Furnace. Several combinations of chalcopyrite concentrates and smelter byproducts were blended by ASARCO to be processed in an electric arc furnace. The furnace charges were calculated to simulate the present and anticipated material flow through the cooperator's smelter in Tacoma, Wash
