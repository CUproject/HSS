Crushed concrete has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first, since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
The first step to recycling old concrete is to use industrial crushing equipment in order to break up the original structure. Next, the broken up concrete is run through a secondary impactor. After being crushed to an even smaller size, the crushed concrete is then screened so that dirt and other foreign objects can be removed.
