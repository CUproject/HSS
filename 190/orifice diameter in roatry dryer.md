## Orifice Meter - Types, Applications & Advantages | Aspire
Applications of Orifice Meter. Listed below are the two primary uses of an orifice meter: It is used to measure the flow rate of fluids in their single state (i.e. gaseous state or liquid state). It can also be used to measure the flow rate of fluids in a mixed state (both gaseous and liquid states) such as, wet steam, or natural gas with water.

## Orifice Spuds - Key Gas
Orifice Spuds. Orifice drill size replaces part number suffix -xx; e.g. part number specifies a #30 (0.1285) orifice drill. Three digit suffixes specify orifice diameter in inches, e.g. has .375 diameter orifice. Insert "S" as sixth digit in part number to order orifices with stamped identification, e.g. 24-077S-375.

Holes Diameter Calculation: PRESSURE > L/MIN > HOLES ∅. Calculation example: having a pump of 200 l/min at 1540 bar, a 6 rear jets nozzle and a 10% pressure loss, it is possible to calculate holes diameter as follows: P = 150 bar - 10% (pressure loss) = 135 bar. 200 l/min ÷ 6 holes = 33,3 l/min for each hole. See below schedule: 135 bar

## Choosing the Right Nozzle for Your Machine - Williams Cleaning
There are different size orifices (or holes) that range from 2 to 60 - a "number 2" orifice is smaller than a "number 8.5" orifice. Each pressure washer should have a specific nozzle size that comes with it. To better explain the importance of the orifice, I will use an example where a garden hose is used to water a yard.
