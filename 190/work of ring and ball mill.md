## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

## How to install and align the girth gear and pinion | prmdrive
The cost of edge drive is low, but the pinion needs to be replaced every 2-5 years. Edge drive is mainly used in coal mills and mills with small power. The girth gear(big ring gear) and pinion are the key of the edge transmission device. Their reliable operation is directly related to the stable production of the mill.
