Jun 27, 2022Jaw crusher features. The welded main frame makes for easier on-site assembly. Rotatable jaw plate ensures higher utilisation of wear liner. The smaller than average nip angle results in effective nipping and crushing of materials in the presence of moisture. Gap setting adjustment allows for easy adjustment through a hand-operated hydraulic arm.

## Jaw Crushers - Parker Plant
Rocksizer Jaw Crushers. RockSizer primary stage jaw crushers feature the upthrust toggle action which is also common to the StoneSizer range. Developed by Parker, this gives a slight downward movement to the swing jaw that promotes a forced feed and therefore increased output while at the same time minimising any rubbing action resulting in a well shaped product and reduced and even wear on

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
Toggle plate compressed between moveable jaw and main body. This mechanism ensures that any point on the moving jaw moves in an elliptical orbit. This mechanism makes a movement aka four bar linkage movement. Through this movement, the movable jaw applies both pressure and friction forces to the material to be crushed.

Jaw-crusher Construction. Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines and hence must be robustly constructed. The main frame is often made from cast iron or steel, connected with tie-bolts. It is commonly made in sections so that it can be transported underground for installation. Modern jaw crushers may have a main frame of welded mild steel plate.

Jaw crushers are reliable, robust machines, offering a 6:1 reduction ratio in most applications, and will accommodate hard, abrasive materials. Or The single-toggle crusher is the simplest and the lightest of the jaw crushers but is suitable only for producing low crushing forces and therefore used for soft rocks.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Basics of Jaw Crusher
Based on the mechanism used crushers are of three types namely Cone Crusher, Jaw Crusher and Impact Crusher. Fracture occurs in the feed material when the strain developed in it due to sufficiently applied impact forces, pressure or shearing effect exceeds the elastic limit .Generally crushers are very rugged, massive and heavy in design.
