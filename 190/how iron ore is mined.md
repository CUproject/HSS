## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral - Geology
The ore was processed by heating it by burning charcoal in simple stone furnaces. The iron ore deposits were small and difficult to exploit. When the large iron ore deposits of the Great Lakes region were discovered, iron ore was no longer mined in the eastern United States. Shown is the Vesuvius Iron Furnace of southern Ohio.

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef, or placer deposit.The exploitation of these deposits for raw material is based on the economic viability of investing in the equipment, labor, and energy required to extract, refine and transport the materials found at the mine to manufacturers who can

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Jan 22, 2022How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Iron ore - Rio Tinto
Our iron ore operations in the Pilbara comprise a world-class, integrated network of 17 iron ore mines, four independent port terminals, a 1,700-kilometre rail network and related infrastructure. Insights from data help us to explore and extract our iron ore efficiently.
