## Quarries - A Solution or a Dust Problem? - Soil Solutions
Quarries. Stone quarrying is a process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into desired sizes. This screened aggregate is then used for the construction of roads, rail lines, bridges, hospitals, schools, airports, factories, and homes, all of which has crucial impact on economic development of any country.

Screen-houses are a standard fixture in the quarry industry. Belt conveyors drop in processed, crushed stone from the quarry site at the top of the screen-house. The rock then passes over a series of different-sized vibrating grilles which initially allows the smallest pieces of dust and stone to fall through into a bin below.
