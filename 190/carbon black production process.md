## Carbon black | McKinsey Energy Insights
Carbon black. Also known as: Furnace black. Carbon black is a specialty product, mad up of solid carbon in a fine powder form.. Carbon black from petroleum is typically produced by thermal decomposition and partial combustion of highly aromatic resid material, especially FCC slurry and pitch from a steam cracker.. The major uses for carbon black are as a filler in rubber (tire) production and

## Carbon Black going 'Green' - Recycling Product News
Traditionally, most carbon black (about 95 percent) is created through burning crude oil, using the 'furnace' process, with an average input of 2.5 litres of oil to manufacture 1 kilogram of carbon black. Current production of carbon black uses Â± 31.751.465.900 litres of oil and is highly polluting, emitting more than 35 million tons of CO2

## Recovered Carbon Black - RCB
Carbon Black Recovery. About 1.5 tons of fossil fuel raw materials and large amounts of water are used to produce 1 ton of carbon black. During the Furnace process, approximately 2.5 - 3.0 tons of CO 2 emissions are released per ton of carbon black produced. As a result, the production of carbon black contributes greatly to the release of greenhouse gases and the associated problems.

In fact, carbon black can make up about 30% of the weight of a tire. Its job is to make the tires stronger and more long-lasting. Carbon black can also be found in the black ink used in inkjet printers and in the rubber parts of many industrial products. Carbon black's nano-scale particles mean that it has a wide range of applications.

## Polypropylene
Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.. Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and non-polar.Its properties are similar to polyethylene, but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant.

The process uses a pair of furnaces that alternate approximately every five minutes between preheating and carbon black production. The natural gas is injected into the hot refractory lined furnace, and, in the absence of air, the heat from the refractory material decomposes the natural gas into carbon black and hydrogen.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

## Case Study in Carbon Black Process Optimization
The carbon black process is a very fast process. The time to steady state is around 15-20 minutes. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is mostly applied is processes with large deadtime. MPC for fast processes requires special design and consideration. An online analyzer was needed to measure product quality.

## Carbon Black as a Polymer Filler | SpringerLink
Important stages during carbon black production and processing that can cover a broad range of compression states are: (1) carbon black powder after the gas separation step in the manufacturing process, (2) densified carbon black flakes or pelletized carbon black, and (3) the polymer compound.
