## The Leathered Quartzite Trend is In! - Academy Marble
Sep 5, 2021Quartzite is mostly solid quartz stone, while engineered quartz is a manmade product featuring about 90% or more crushed quartz, mixed with binding agents, like resins and polymers, to create a nonporous surface material. If you're looking for the prestige, strength, and durability of natural stone, quartzite is a fantastic option.

## Crushed granite or Crushed quartz?
The granite has about 10 to 14% of Al2O3, in acid soil, it will release Al into the soil. But the quartz will not release anything. That's why Al has a post about inorganic soil prefer PH in the upper 5 range. That means that Granite could be dangerous if the container PH is too low, while crushed quartz should not have similar problem.
