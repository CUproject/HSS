## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.  The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022Flotation is usually used by large scale miners but can also be applied in small scale operations. It is a process that works best for processing complex ore types, especially ores that are difficult to process using gravity methods. In flotation, a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine.

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
1. Gold Processing. The first step in gold smelting involves processing the gold ore. The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together. The gold ore is then pulverized using pressure to create very fine particles.
