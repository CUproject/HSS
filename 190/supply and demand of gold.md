## Gold Demand - Analyze it and Profit | Sunshine Profits
Gold Physical Investment Demand. The gold investment demand is made up of direct ownership of gold bullion, i.e., bars and coins, or indirect ownership via Exchange-Traded Funds ( ETFs) and similar products. The former component is known as gold physical investment demand. Gold bars and coins are viewed as a store of value asset by many investors.

## Gold Demand Ever-Growing; Supply Beginning to Fall
In terms of supply and demand fundamentals there are many positives in favor of gold - notably ever-increasing demand patterns, particularly in Asia, and the beginnings of a turndown in new mined supply.  New mined gold supply at around 3,200 metric tons a year, may well be beginning to fall (peak gold) as the drop in the gold price

Recycling is the source of gold supply that is most immediately responsive to the gold price and economic shocks. The majority of recycled gold - at least 90% - comes from jewellery, with gold extracted from technology providing the remainder. Of course, for gold to be of a guaranteed quality, it needs to be processed and refined.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.
