## Resource utilization of slag from desulphurization and slag skimming: A 
May 1, 20221. Introduction. Steel slag is a by-product produced by the conversion of carbon-rich molten iron into steel in basic oxygen furnaces (BOFs) and electric arc furnaces (EAFs) during the steelmaking process, accounting for about 15 to 20 wt% of the crude steel production .The global steelmaking industry produced 1.8 billion tons of crude steel in 2019, and China alone accounted for 996.3 million
