## Alternatives to mercury use in small-scale gold mining
Dec 30, 2020In Zimbabwe elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, resulting in the formation of the mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process is very dangerous and can lead to significant mercury exposure with serious environmental and health risks.
