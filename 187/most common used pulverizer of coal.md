## Vertical Grinding Mill (Coal Pulverizer) Explained - saVRee
Coal pulverizers are used to dry, grind and classify. Drying is achieved as hot gas passes through the pulverizer and removes moisture from the pulverized coal. The hot gases used should have a low oxygen content, this reduces the likelihood of accidental combustion within the mill. It is possible for hot gases to be taken directly from the

Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.

## used coal pulverizers
Pulverizers (coal pulverizer) are used to pulverize pieces of coal into fine particles (100μm) before placing into a boiler, to ensure efficient combustion. Pulverizers have three functions, pulverization, drying and classification. The classification function plays the important role of ensuring that only fine particles of the pulverized coal
