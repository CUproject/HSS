What happens chemically during these procedure - why does it work, and what are the byproducts of these reactions? This process cleans silver by a redox process. Aluminum is a more active metal than silver. This means that aluminum metal, Al(s), will reduce silver salts (salts of Ag +). The most common type of tarnish on silver is silver oxide

## What Are The Byproducts of Combustion | CCS Boiler Industrial Burners
Mar 2, 2022The By-Products of Combustion. Water vapor is a harmless by-product of complete combustion. Carbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas but can partially be absorbed by plants as a normal part of the biological carbon cycle. Carbon monoxide is an air pollutant and is toxic to the human body. It's called the "silent killer" because it

## Disinfection By-Products | The Safe Water System | CDC
Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by the chemist Karl Scheele 1. One of the first known uses of chlorine for disinfection was not until 1850, when Snow used it to attempt to disinfect London's water supply during that now-famous cholera epidemic. It was not until the early 1900's, however, that chlorine was widely used as a disinfectant 2.
