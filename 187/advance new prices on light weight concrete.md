INTRODUCTION: Light weight concrete is a special concrete which weighs lighter than conventional concrete. Density of this concrete is considerably low (300 kg/m3 to 1850 kg/m3) when compared to normal concrete (2200kg/m3 to 2600kg/m3). Three types of LWC - Light weight aggregate concrete - Aerated concrete - No - fines concrete 3. 4.

An important question always is how much this will cost. Lightweight aggregate concrete is about $20 to $30 per cubic yard higher than a normal weight mix. For internal curing, you may only be replacing about a third of the aggregate with lightweight so it may only add an extra $10 per cubic yard.
