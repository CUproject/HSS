## Use of Manufactured Sand in Concrete and Construction An Alternate to 
The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.

Higher concrete strength when compared to river sand. Lower concrete strength when compared with M sand. Sand particles of M sand are cubically shaped. This makes bonding strong. Excessive presence of flaky, sharp and angular grains makes bonding weak. Silt content is zero. Silt content is in between 3-20%.

## Why do we need sand filling under foundation footings?
We could also use crushed sand instead of river sand. Reason 5 - Sometimes, the water table level is equal to the depth of footing. So the soil looks very wet and clayey. If the concrete was poured directly on the wet soil surface, there is a chance for concrete ingredients segregation. It is also very critical for the compaction of concrete

## Readers ask: Sand Or Gravel Under Concrete Slab?
Pour concrete over a solid, well-drained base. Because concrete slabs "float" on the soil, soft ground or voids underneath may cause unsupported areas to crack under heavy weight like vehicles. Pack about 4 in. of sand or gravel over clay and other poorly draining soils to provide even support.

##  Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
The global consumption of natural sand is very high, due to the extensive use of concrete or mortar. The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass) and strongly influence the concrete's fresh and hardened properties. Now a day's sand is becoming a very scarce material.

Difference Between M sand and River sand. Concrete with m sand has very poor permeability as compared to river sand. But when river sand is used in concrete the permeability of concrete is less poor as compared to river sand. It has more water absorption 2 to 4 %. Whereas water absorption of river sand is less 1.5 to 3%.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
