## Electrolytic Refining of Gold - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Electrolytic Refining of Gold. The method just described aims at leaving gold in an insoluble state at the anode. Other impurities are usually left there, and the gold sponge, or slimes, needs further refining by methods, to be indicated later. By using a suitable electrolyte the gold can be dissolved from the anode bars and deposited in sheet

## Etching aluminum electrolysisnd-ostsee
The surface effect produced by most direct chemical attacks (e.g., as by an acid) is a uniform etching of the metal. On a polished surface, this type of corrosion is first seen as a general dulling of the surface and, if allowed to continue, the surface becomes rough and possibly frosted in appearance. The discoloration or general dulling of.

Set the gold ore and a small quantity of lead in a cupel. Place the cupel in a blast furnace. Heat the mixture until the lead and gold ore liquefy. The blast furnace batters the cupel with hot air. The lead combines with other metals and forms oxide compounds that separate from the gold. This process works best with small quantities of gold ore.
