## Gyratory VS Jaw Crushers: Advantages & Disadvantages
The jaw crusher will handle sticky,'or dirty feed better than the gyratory, there being no diaphragm below the crushing chamber on which such material can pack. Routine maintenance and repair jobs are generally more easily accomplished on the jaw crusher than on the gyratory. Major repairs are about a stand-off.

The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are

Gyratory crushers are principally used in surface-crushing plants. The gyratory crusher (Figure 6.5) consists essentially of a long spindle, carrying a hard steel conical grinding element, the head, seated in an eccentric sleeve. The spindle is suspended from a "spider" and, as it rotates, normally between 85 and 150 rpm, it sweeps out a

The primary gyratory crusher offers high capacity thanks to its generously dimensioned circular discharge opening (which provides a much larger area than that of the jaw crusher) and the continuous operation principle (while the reciprocating motion of the jaw crusher produces a batch crushing action). The gyratory crusher has capacities

## Gyratory Crusher l Introduce, Working Principle - JXSC Mine
Crusher Machine Advantage. The good effect of fine crushing 1. There are cracks and other weak spots or defects in almost any particle. The double-cavity gyratory crushing, because of the multi-directional pressure on the material, under the interaction of multi-layer material, makes the material easier to be broken from the defect.
