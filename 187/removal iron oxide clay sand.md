## Removal of Pb(II) using polyaniline composites and iron oxide coated 
In this research, natural sand and clay coated with polyaniline and iron oxide were used to remove Pb(II) from contaminated water.  As can be seen when iron oxide/clay, iron oxide/sand, polyaniline/clay and polyaniline/sand were used as adsorbent in a fix-bed column method, the removal percentage of Pb(II) were 97.50, 99.24, 72.99, 68.80%

## Interaction of aluminum and iron oxides and clay minerals and their 
Abstract Amorphous and crystalline aluminum and iron oxide minerals play a major role in stabilizing soil structure as measured by aggregate stability and clay dispersion. Aluminum and iron oxide interactions with clays are pH dependent. At low pH, where the oxides carry sufficient positive charge, they precipitate on clay surfaces. These coatings, once formed, are stable at higher pHs.

## Cleaning mineral specimens: a guide for mineral collectors and field 
The basic procedure is: First wash your minerals carefully in water to remove any loose sand and dirt and to make the acid last as long as possible (sand and dirt contain iron oxide and will exhaust your acid quickly).. Place your minerals in a large plastic container with a lid that can be tightly sealed.

## Iron / manganese removal - Lenntech
Iron removal by physical-chemical way consists in iron oxidation by air followed by sand filtration, but other techniques exist as well: O xidation + sand filtration. (physical chemical way) For water with pH > 7, low redox potential, low iron content (< 3mg/L) Oxidation + sand filtration + MnO 2 filter. For higher iron content and/or manganese.
