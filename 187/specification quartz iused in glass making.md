## Quartz Manufacturing Process Step by Step - Bsg Glass Chips
Nov 16, 20213) Pressing of Slabs. After the blending process, the slabs are formed. Using the vacuum and vibration method and pressure about 100 seconds at 100 tons pressure, the blended mixture is compacted to form the slabs. Using such process decreases water absorption and can minimize porosity.
