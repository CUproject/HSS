## Car making grinding noise when accelerating
A loud squealing sound when you accelerate might be a problem with your engine belt. When this part gets worn out or slack, it will make noise when you drive. If the problem isn't the belt itself, it might be an issue with the belt pulley. When they fail, they won't move the belt as they should to keep the car going.

## The history and processes of milling - Resilience
Stone mills were powered by water or wind to grind the grain between two large stones. Stone mills were common throughout Europe and they were excellent for grinding soft wheat varieties. The grain is poured into a hole in the upper stone, called the runner, and is distributed across the bottom stone, called the sleeper.

Different grinding machines are usually named as mills, for example rod mills, ball mills, and attrition mills. Because of the name, verb milling is also been used as a synonym for grinding.
