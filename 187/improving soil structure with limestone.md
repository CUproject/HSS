To add amendments before planting. Till the soil with a rototiller, spade, or garden fork 6 to 8 inches deep until the soil is workable. Work in the amendments throughout the soil. (Rotted manure and compost are of the most benefit if worked into the top 2 to 3 inches of the soil.) Rake the soil level for planting.

## Improving Soil Structure
The most common way to raise the pH of your soil (make it less acidic) is to add powdered limestone. Dolomitic limestone will also add manganese to the soil. Apply it in the fall because it takes several months to alter the pH. Wood ash will also raise the pH, and it works more quickly than limestone and contains potassium and trace elements.

Soils with a high proportion of exchangeable sodium (Na+) lose structure. Once soil is tightly packed, water and air penetration is reduced and root growth suffers. Water often puddles on the surface of these soils. To revitalize sodic soils, incorporate gypsum into the soil and then apply six or more inches of water.
