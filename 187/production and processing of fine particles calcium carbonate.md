## Influence of chemical additives on the formation of super-fine calcium 
A modified carbonation process for the synthesis of super-fine calcium carbonate particles from Ca(OH) 2 slurry at room temperature using a CO 2 -air gas mixture was investigated. The adaptation of a radial-shaped sparger and the addition of chemicals such as ZnCl 2 and EDTA accelerated the carbonation process, thus reducing the diameter of the precipitated calcium carbonate particles.

Abstract. Calcium carbonate production via CO2 mineralization offers an attractive route for carbon capture and utilization. The process sequesters CO2 in a stable form of fine precipitated calcium carbonate, a high-value product with unit price in the range of $230-$280/t and a global market projected to reach 99 M tons in 2020.
