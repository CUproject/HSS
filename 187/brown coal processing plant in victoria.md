## equipment for the processing of brown coal
Coal Mining and Production. Coal occurs in a wide range of forms and qualities. There are two broad categories: (a) hard coal, which includes coking coal (used to produce steel) and other bituminous and anthracite coals used for steam and power generation; and (b) brown coal (sub-bituminous and lignite), which is used mostly as on-site fuel.
