## Iron ore
Mining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening,  Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business,  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

How is iron ore mined? Iron ore undergoes a series of processes from pit to port before export. First, we explore the geology of the region to find the best iron ore prospects for our mining operations. Once the ideal site has been chosen, the ore is drilled and blasted. It is transported to the primary crusher for processing.

Crushing. A crusher is used to break the ore down to a smaller size suitable for transport. The crusher is made up of a number of components that include a vibrating screen, a jaw crusher and sizers. Fine material drops through the vibrating screen while larger material passes over the screen to the jaw crusher that breaks up the large rocks.
