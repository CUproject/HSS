## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.
