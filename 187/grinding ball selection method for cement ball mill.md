## The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide
22 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically

There are two methods for clinker pretreatment: pre-crushing and pre-grinding. 1) The pre-crushing uses a crusher to crush the clinker before grinding, which can reduce the diameter of clinker particle to 5 ~ 8mm. 2) The pre-grinding adds a roller press to the cement grinding system. In this system, the clinker is extruded circularly, dispersed
