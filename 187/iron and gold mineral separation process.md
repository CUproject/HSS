## Separating Iron and gold from rock. by Elsa Huber - Prezi
There are many ways to extract iron ore from rock. Iron is magnetic so you could use a method that involves magnets, and it is also heavier than a lot of substances, so you could use a shaker and see which pieces weigh more. However, the way that we thought to separate iron ore

## Mineral processing
Gravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation, classification, magnetic separation and leaching. Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.

Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.
