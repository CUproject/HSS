## Dolomite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Dolomite is a cheap, disposable catalyst that can significantly reduce the tar content of the product gas from a gasifier. It may be used as a primary catalyst, dry-mixed with biomass, or, more commonly, placed in a downstream reactor, in which case it is often referred to as a guard bed. View chapter Purchase book.
