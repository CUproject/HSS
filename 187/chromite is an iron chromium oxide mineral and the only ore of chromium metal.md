Studies on solid-state reduction of chromite have shown that the iron oxides get reduced more readily than the chrome oxides. Under such conditions, iron forms only one carbide Fe 3 C, which can dissolve chromium to form a complex carbide (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3. Thus, an ore rich in iron oxide will have high reducibility at relatively low temperatures.
