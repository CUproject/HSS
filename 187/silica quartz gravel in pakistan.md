## Crystalline Silica - Cancer-Causing Substances - NCI
An abundant natural material, crystalline silica is found in stone, soil, and sand. It is also found in concrete, brick, mortar, and other construction materials. Crystalline silica comes in several forms, with quartz being the most common. Quartz dust is respirable crystalline silica, which means it can be taken in by breathing.

## Construction Workers Should Know Silica: It's not just dust
Crystalline silica is a bigger worry for the health of our lungs. The most common form of crystalline silica is quartz, which is found in sand, gravel, clay, granite, diatomaceous earth, and many other forms of rock. Non-crystalline silica is found in glass, silicon carbide, and silicone. These materials are much less hazardous to the lungs.

## Why is Silica Hazardous? - Silica Safe
Silica, often referred to as quartz, is a very common mineral. It is found in many materials common on construction and oil & gas sites, including soil, sand, concrete, masonry, rock, granite, and landscaping materials. The dust created by cutting, grinding, drilling or otherwise disturbing these materials can contain crystalline silica particles.
