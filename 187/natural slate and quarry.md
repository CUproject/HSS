## Do's and Don'ts - Caring for Your Natural Slate Flooring - MSI Surfaces
The natural beauty of slate tile flooring makes it a popular choice - and it is as durable as it is pleasing to the eye. However, all natural stone needs a little more work and careful treatment to maintain its good looks. It's well worth the extra effort, and with the proper stone care and maintenance, a slate tile floor can last for decades.

## Stone Quarries | Select Stone
Flatwillow Moss Rock comes from a specific 4″- to 10″-thick sandstone layer that is exposed at the surface on the ranches where we quarry this stone. Because it is exposed at the surface, it is weathered and partly covered with lichens. Flatwillow is quarried as natural shape moss rock, as larger mantles and hearths, and as landscape boulders.
