## What Is The Difference Between Limestone And Chalk? - CLJ
May 31, 2022By Travis Thornton May 31, 2022. Limestone is a sedimentary carbonate rock. Chalk is a type of limestone. The key difference between limestone and chalk is that the limestone contains both minerals, calcite, and aragonite whereas chalk is a form of limestone which contains calcite.

May 23, 2021Expect to go 50-100 blocks or more to find limestone. If Kernite, Galena, Phosphorite, Borax, Halite, Sulfur, or a coal (lignite/brown, bituminous/black, or anthracite), then there is a decent chance of chalk or limestone being there if limonite is not detected. Consider doing more propick surveys to detect an above marker, or look for a mountain.

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
