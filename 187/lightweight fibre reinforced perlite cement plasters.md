The volume fractions (Vf) of 0.25%, 0.375% and 0.5% were studied for each fibre. As various PP fibres were added into oil palm shell fibre reinforced concrete, the marginal density reduction was reported. The effectiveness of new types of PP fibres to increase the compressive strength at later ages was more pronounced than at early age.

This paper describes the mechanical response of lightweight mortars subjected to impact loading in flexure.Expanded perlite aggregate with a bulk density of 64 kg/m 3 was used at between 0 and 8 times by volume of Portland cement to yield a range of mortars with density between 1000 and 2000 kg/m 3.Some specimens were reinforced with a polypropylene microfibre at 0.1% volume fraction and the
