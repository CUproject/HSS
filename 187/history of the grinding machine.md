Grinding is an abrasive machining process used for fine machining and finishing of workpieces. It can be performed manually or using grinding machines. As with all abrasive procedures, excess material is removed from the workpiece in the form of chips. The cutting is actually performed by the edges of microscopically small hard mineral crystals
