## Problems in the grinding system of gold ore dressing process
Nov 16, 2020The annual output of heavy placer gold in the gold ore dressing plant accounts for about 25% of the annual gold output. When the coarse-grained gold enters the leaching system, the process flow cannot be satisfied due to the long leaching time required, which further affects the tailings and tailing liquid indicators.
