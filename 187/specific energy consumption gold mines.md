## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The amount of energy that these and other life sciences sectors use must be reevaluated by businesses. The SEC value, or specific energy consumption, can assist in determining how much energy a firm consumes and how efficiently it is managed. Analysis of how a company uses coal, gas, air, and water, and other resources must be done properly.
