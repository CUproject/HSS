## ball mill open circuit vs close circuit difference - Energy
Sep 18, 2020Apr 15, 2004 Abstract. The characteristic differences between open- and closed-circuit grinding systems were examined via the use of a continuous vibration ball mill and a blade type classifier. For the same median diameter of the product, the rate of powder production in the closed-circuit is about 5% higher than that of the open-circuit.

## Ball Mill Open Circuit Vs Close Circuit Difference
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds The feed to ball mills dry basis is typically 75 vol ore and 25 steel The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.
