An explosive carrier can carry only 1 case containing 5 kg of explosive but Director of Mines Safety may give relaxation. Explosive case should be numbered. Jeep or trailer is allowed to carry more explosives for opencast mines for deep holes. Preparation of Charge: The charge for blasting in a hole may consists of one or more cartridges.
