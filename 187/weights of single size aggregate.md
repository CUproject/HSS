Feb 3, 2022Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.

## Unit weight of 10mm, 12mm, 20mm & 40mm coarse aggregate
Unit weight of 12mm aggregate:- unit weight or density of 12mm/ 12.5mm coarse aggregate/ crushed stone/ gravel/ coarse sand is ranging between 1500 kg/m3 to 1550 kg/m3, it means weight of 1 cubic meter of 12mm size course aggregate is around 1500kg to 1550kg or 1.5 to 1.55 MT.

## Aggregate Sizing Explained - Chaney Enterprises
A #1 aggregate is a nominal size of 3 ½ to 1 ½ inches and a #8 aggregate is a nominal size of 3/8 to 0.094 inch. More specifically, a #57 aggregate is the combination of #5 and #7 aggregates ranging from 1 to 0.19 inch. Chaney Enterprises' aggregate materials meet the ASTM C 33 Standard and can be found at our various locations throughout

## Aggregates - Cement
Generally, flat and elongated particles are avoided or are limited to about 15 percent by weight of the total aggregate. Unit-weight measures the volume that graded aggregate and the voids between them will occupy in concrete. The void content between particles affects the amount of cement paste required for the mix. Angular aggregates increase
