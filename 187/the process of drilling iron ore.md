## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## the process of drilling iron ore
The molten iron and slag are removed, or cast, from the furnace periodically. The casting process begins with drilling a hole, called the taphole, into the clay-filled iron notch at the base of the hearth. During casting, molten iron flows into runners that lead to transport ladles. Slag also flows.

The drillers have to tackle three main ore types; laminated iron ore, drilled at 120 -130 m per shift (using the PV-271 and single-pass DTH drilling), loose conglomerate, and compact conglomerate. Very abrasive phyllites and quartzites are also encountered as well as "soft" iron on the Mokaning development property.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron.  Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing

## Process Of Iron Mining
The Mining Process. The Mining Process. 1. Mining open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.
