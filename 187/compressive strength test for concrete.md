## Compressive strength of concrete - cube test procedure & result at 7 
Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load / Cross Sectional Area, cross sectional Area = 150mm X 150mm = 22500mm2 or 225 cm2, assume the compression load is 563 KN, then Compressive Strength of M25 concrete after 28 days = (563N/22500mm2= 25N/mm2 (20MPa) or 3626 Psi.

## What is Compression Testing? - Instron
Compression testing allows manufacturers to assess the integrity and safety of materials, components, and products during several phases of the manufacturing process. The potential applications can vary from strength testing of a car windshield to endurance testing of concrete beams used in construction. Materials that exhibit high tensile
