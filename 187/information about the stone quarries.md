Ancient stone quarries are one of the site types greatly under-represented on the current list.

## Stone quarries of ancient Egypt
The stone quarries of ancient Egypt once produced quality stone for the construction of decorative monuments such as sculptures and obelisks.These quarries are now recognised archaeological sites. Eighty percent of the ancient quarry sites are in the Nile valley; some of them have disappeared under the waters of Lake Nasser and some others were lost due to modern mining activity.

Limestone quarries. Quarries of limestone, sandstone and granite are scattered all along the Nile, with a greater share near the south of the delta, on the Cairo side and in its southern part. The Giza pyramids were made with a local stone, directly extracted from the Giza plateau. These are open-air quarries that we still see today.
