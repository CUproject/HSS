## Lime kiln
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction is . CaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2. This reaction can take place at anywhere above 840 °C (1544 °F), but is generally considered to occur at 900 °C(1655 °F) (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO 2 is 1

## historic processing line into lime
The lime cycle consists of first burning of limestone to form quicklime. Hydrated lime can then be produced by adding water to the quicklime. At this point, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or from industrial processes react with hydrated lime to convert it back to limestone. This cycle is called the lime .

from limestone. Lime is made by the process of cakining limestone, that is, burning Che limestone without fusing (melcing) it. Pure lime (quicklime, burnt lime, caustic lime) is composed of calcium oxide-. When tre.ated with water, lime gives off heat, forming calcium hydroxide. and is sold commercially as slaked (or hydrated) lime.
