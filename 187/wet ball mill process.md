## Difference Between Wet Ball Milling Vs Dry Ball Milling
Sep 18, 2022The process of wet ball milling is often used when manufacturing paints, inks, and other pigmented products. Dry Ball Milling. Dry ball milling is the process of grinding materials into a powder without the addition of any liquid. This means that the material will be ground using only friction and compression, without the addition of any

## Puddling (metallurgy)
The process begins by preparing the puddling furnace. This involves bringing the furnace to a low temperature and then fettling it. Fettling is the process of painting the grate and walls around it with iron oxides, typically hematite; this acts as a protective coating keeping the melted metal from burning through the furnace. Sometimes finely pounded cinder was used instead of hematite.
