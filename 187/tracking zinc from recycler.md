## Why is Zinc Recycling Different? - Manville Recycling
The recycling process is different because of the fact that most zinc material is used in conjunction with other metals (for example, the metal needs to be separated from steel in order to be recycled, which adds an extra step to the recycling process). Fortunately, technology has advanced enough to improve the process and now 90% of the

The State of Zinc Recycling Zinc is a widely-used metal. Its most common use is in treating steel through a process called galvanization, which essentially involves coating the steel with zinc. This is done to make the steel more durable, especially protecting it from the effects of environmental changes. Get price; Tracking Zinc From Recycler

Approaches include: 1. Measuring and tracking the quantity of materials that would have otherwise gone to landfill (collected at recycling depots, composting facilities, and traded at re-use facilities). 2. Developing indicators that relate the quantity of recycled materials to the total amount that could be captured.
