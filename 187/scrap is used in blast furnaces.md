## Reduction of CO2 emissions through recycling: thyssenkrupp Steel and 
May 17, 2021The basis is an innovative production process developed by TSR, in which a high-quality recycling product is made from common recovered scrap. The process is to be tested and optimized in a joint project for use in the blast furnaces of thyssenkrupp Steel with the goal of producing the high-quality recycling product in the required quantities.
