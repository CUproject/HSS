The parent substance is crushed into smaller pieces while being suspended in the liquid. You can prepare pastes, idli/dosa batter, etc. using the wet grinding process.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

Feb 19, 2022Wet grinding is more efficient. It has a higher production capacity and lower power consumption than the dry grinding. The material is easy to flow. The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution.
