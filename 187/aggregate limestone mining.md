## Aggregate | Earth Sciences Museum | University of Waterloo
Aggregate materials are either used in their natural state or after crushing, washing, and sizing. The materials can be used loosely, or sand, gravel, and crushed stone can be combined with a binding media to form concrete, mortar or asphalt. The mining process begins with the removal of the overburden to reveal the materials underneath.
