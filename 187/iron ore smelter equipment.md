Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

By the late 1600's and early 1700's, iron ore was still being mined in Virginia and western Massachusetts. Small scale bloomeries, the most primitive form of smelting, reduced the ore into a porous mass of iron slag called bloom or sponge iron.The bloom was hammered into a low quality wrought iron by using hand held or large, heavy hammers powered by water.
