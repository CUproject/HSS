## Can waste foundry sand fully replace structural concrete sand 
Foundry sand (FS) waste creates a serious solid waste management problem worldwide due to the high volumes produced, necessitating alternatives to landfilling.  in India approximately 5000 foundries were reported to produce ca. 1,710,000 tons of waste FS per year ; many of these foundries dump the waste causing environmental degradation .

## Optimising on waste sand | Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre
Disposal of waste foundry sand (WFS) remains one of the major challenges faced by the foundry industry today. India's annual casting production is around 9.3 million tons which is the third highest in the world.WFS contains toxic heavy metals and particulate matter which makes dumping of waste sand an environmental and health hazard.

## FOUNDRY SAND WASTE - WasteCare
FOUNDRY SAND WASTE. Foundries create metal castings for use in the automotive, art, construction, agriculture, and mining industries. In this process, molten metal is poured into a mold, usually made from sand or ceramics. As castings are created, the sand has to be removed and replaced due to abrasion from the high heat and mechanical stress.
