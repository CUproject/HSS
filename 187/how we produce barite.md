Barite is mostly mined as an ore for barium. It can form as crystals or as an aggregate. The mineral is most often white or colorless but can form in array of colors. Crystals are transparent to opaque with prismatic, tabular, bladed, or acicular habits. Aggregates can be massive, granular, concretionary, and fibrous.

About 0.05 percent of Earth's crust is barium, making it the 17th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Barite has an orthorhombic crystal structure. Barite has an unusual combination of properties: high density, softness, and chemical inertness. Barite's most desirable characteristic is its high specific gravity.

Sep 14, 2020Barite, the main ore of barium, helps in making a varied types of barium compounds. Some of these compounds are used for x-ray shielding. Barite is able to block x-ray and gamma-ray radiations. Therefore, high-density concretes are made of barite so that the x-ray emissions in power plants, laboratories, and hospitals are blocked.
