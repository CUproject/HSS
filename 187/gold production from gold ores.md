## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

## Gold Production Top 15 - Simplicable
Gold production is the mining and refining of gold from deposits in the Earth. Due to the relatively high value of gold, this is often a technologically advanced process that makes use of chemicals. For example, gold cyanidation is a common hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore using aqueous solutions of cyanide.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

Of 2017 US production, Nevada alone accounted for over 75%.US gold production in 2017 increased 10% over 2016. The increase was largely attributed to the increase in gold production from the Cortez Mine in Nevada and the Cresson Mine in Colorado due to higher ore grades and better gold recoveries; and due to two new mines - the Haile Mine in South Carolina and the Long Canyon Mine in Nevada.

## Gold: History of Use, Mining, Prospecting, Assay & Production - Geology
Early Gold Finds and Production. Gold was produced in the southern Appalachian region as early as 1792 and perhaps as early as 1775 in southern California. The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in California sparked the gold rush of, and hundreds of mining camps sprang to life as new deposits were discovered.
