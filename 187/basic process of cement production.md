## Cement | Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Cement production is an energy intensive process, with energy costs representing 20-40% of production costs (IEA, 2007. p. 145). Since 1990s, globally there has been a gradual reduction in the "clinker ratio" - the ratio of clinker to cement in the final product - which reflects in reduced specific energy consumption.

The basic minerals used to make cement. Limestone  Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production.  â€¢ About 20% of gypsum goes towards cement production. And . Cement Substitutes.

It is generally known that cement is produced from limestone, mar/clay and gypsum by the following three basic process- wet semi- wet and dry process. The cost of exploiting the limestone: the major raw material constitute about 50% of the production cost which results in the high cost of cement.

## Hydrogen-powered cement production to reduce carbon emissions
Feb 17, 2021The cement industry is one of the two largest producers of CO2, producing up to 8 per cent of global man-made carbon emissions. This is mainly due to the very high temperatures required to produce clinker, the main component in cement. These numbers have led to a growing interest in innovations that could reduce the carbon emissions of cement

## New approach suggests path to emissions-free cement
The new process would eliminate or drastically reduce both sources, Chiang says. Though they have demonstrated the basic electrochemical process in the lab, the process will require more work to scale up to industrial scale.  Cement production currently causes 8 percent of global carbon emissions. In their laboratory demonstration, the team

## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
