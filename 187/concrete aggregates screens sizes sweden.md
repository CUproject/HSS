(2) Compressive strength of a concrete increases with increase in coarse aggregate size. Coarse aggregate size 13.2 mm, 19 mm, 25 mm, and 37.5 mm gave average compressive strength of 21.26 N/mm2, 23.41 N/mm2, 23.66 N/mm2 and 24.31N/mm2 respectively.

## Aggregate in Concrete - Concrete Network
Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.

At a given water ratio, within the range employed in most structural concrete, smaller maximum sizes of aggregate will tend to produce higher concrete strengths than larger ones. 2. The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence, for a given cement factor, will produce concrete of lower water-ratio than the smaller sizes. 3.

Roughly 60-75% of concrete is comprised of aggregates, and aggregates make up around 90% of paving asphalt. To create strong, stable construction materials, the aggregate used must be clean and meet strict specifications. Most aggregates are harvested from pits, quarries, lakes, or rivers, then crushed to various specified sizes.

Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch, but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder. Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit, river, lake, or seabed.
