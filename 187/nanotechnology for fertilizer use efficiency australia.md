The reduced particle size of nano fertilizer results in

##  Nano Fertilizers Smart Nutrient Delivery System to Increase the 
porous nano fertilizer may include a network of channels that retain nutrient solubility. The use of nanotechnology for fertilizers is still in the budding stage but is already adopted for medical and engineering applications Types of nanofertilizer designs i. Slow-release: The nano-capsules release nutrients over a specific period of time

## Nanotechnology in controlled-release fertilizers - ScienceDirect
Jan 1, 2021One of the effective solutions against nanotoxicity is the use of green nanotechnology. By the use of safe and efficient particles, the toxicity to the plants, environment, water bodies, animals, and humans can be minimized [40,41]. 9. Conclusion. Nanotechnology plays a key role in many fields including medicine and agriculture.
