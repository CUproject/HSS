## 4 stone vs 57 stonee-barssel
57 stone is an aggregate material suitable for driveways, parking lots, construction site entrances, and pipe bedding among other things. The specifications are 1″ minus with very little powder. Generally #57 gravel is processed from concrete or Florida limerock. Granite is typically used when the application calls for a decorative stone.

Free Powerpoint Templates Page 18 Conclusions The chemical compositions of quarry rock dust and marble sludge powder such as Fe2O3, MnO, Na2O,MgO, K2O, Al2O3, CaO, and SiO2 are comparable with that of cement. The replacement of fine aggregate with 50% marble sludge powder and 50% Quarry rock dust (Green concrete) gives an excellent result

## quarry dust as substitute for sand in concrete
Quarry dust can be used as an alternative to the river sand. Cost analysis shows that there is 40% savings if quarry dust is used instead of sand. Illangoan.R [2000] [1] has done a study on replacement of sand by quarry dust in concrete. The compressive strength of concrete with quarry dust has 40%
