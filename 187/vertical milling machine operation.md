## CNC Milling: What is it, How It Works, Operations, Overview - IQS Directory
The milling process begins by inserting the workpiece into the CNC machine's work surface or holding device. This is followed by placement of the milling tools to the machine's spindle. The directionality of the milling process can be either horizontal or vertical depending on the requirements programmed from CAD.

Jul 21, 2021A vertical milling machine can be used for a variety of different operations. For example, a horizontal mill can be converted to a vertical mill. Moreover, you can also convert a horizontal mill to a vertical one when the operation grows. While the vertical mill can be more versatile, a horizontal mill can handle heavier materials.

May 22, 2022From the above figures, basic milling operation can also be understood. The milling cutter is circular and a large number of cutting edges (or teeth) are arranged along its circumference.  End mills have a tapered shank which fits into a tapered sleeve provided in the spindle of a vertical milling machine.

Drilling Machine Definition: Drilling is a material-removing or cutting process in which the tool uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular cross-section in solid materials. This is the most common machining process, one estimate is that 75% of all metal cutting material removed comes from the drilling operation.
