## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## How Is Cement Produced in Cement Plants | Cement Making Process
This type of cement was invented in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin. It is named 'portland cement' because its property is similar to the stone quarried on the Ise of Portland, England. The making process of portland cement in the modern industry can be divided into the wet process, dry process, and semi-dry process.
