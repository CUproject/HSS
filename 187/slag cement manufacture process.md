## Why slag is used in cement?m.youramys
What is slag used in concrete? Slag cement is a hydraulic cement formed when granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is ground to suitable fineness and is used to replace a portion of portland cement. It is a recovered industrial by-product of an iron blast furnace. What is slag used for? While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting, they can also serve other purposes, such

## Manufacturing Process Of Cement - Construction How
The primary raw materials for the mass production of cement can either be calcareous or argillaceous. The former ingredient is obtained from limestone, marl, cement rock, chalk, etc., whereas the latter one is procured from clay, slate, blast furnace slag, shale, etc. The process of manufacturing cement can either be a wet process or a dry process.

The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ‚Å∞C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## Cement Manufacture - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The dry process of cement manufacture is most often used, but some plants utilise the wet process, which avoids the necessity of drying the slag. In Germany the slag is used both in the manufacture of the Portland cement clinker by the dry process and for grinding subsequently with the clinker to form the Portland blastfurnace cement.

By Cement. May 27, 2012. No Comments. Blast-furnace slag (BFS) is formed from a liquid at ¬∞C during the manufacture of iron. When reaching the bottom of the furnace, the liquid slag forms a layer on top of the molten iron due to its lower density. Being separated from the molten iron, the liquid slag is cooled in the air or with water.

## How to Make Cement From Blast-Furnace Slag
The process of manufacture is very simple, and, in brief, is as follows:‚Äî. The dried granulated slag is mixed with a predetermined quantity of dry slaked lime and ground to an impalpable powder. It is then ready for use as cement. The slag sand, after being drained, still contains a large percentage of adhering water.

## slag cement manufacture process
Mar 27, 2021The dry process of cement manufacture is most often used, but some plants utilise the wet process, which avoids the necessity of drying the slag. In Germany the slag is used both in the manufacture of the Portland cement clinker by the dry process and for grinding subsequently with the clinker to form the Portland blastfurnace cement.

## Blast Furnace Slag - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
10.2.2 Blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slag (BFS) is a by-product from iron production in blast furnaces, which are fed by a mixture of iron-ore, coke and limestone. In the process, the iron ore is reduced to iron while all remaining materials form the slag, which is tapped off as a molten liquid and cooled.
