## History of gold mining in Victoria - Earth Resources
Jun 2, 2021Victoria's first officially recognised gold discovery was in 1850 near Clunes, almost 40 kilometres north of Ballarat. In 1851, the Victorian Government offered a reward of £200 to anyone finding gold within 200 miles (320 kilometres) of Melbourne. Within six months, gold was discovered in Clunes, and then Ballarat, Castlemaine and Bendigo.
