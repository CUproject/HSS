## Use of coal - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Use of coal. In 2021, about 546 million short tons (MMst) of coal were consumed in the United States. On an energy content basis, this amount was equal to about 10.5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) and to about 10.8% of total U.S. energy consumption. This was the lowest amount since 1964 and the second-lowest percentage share after 2020
