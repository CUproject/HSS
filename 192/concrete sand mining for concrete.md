## Concrete - Minecraft Wiki
Concrete is a solid block available in the 16 regular dye colors. Concrete requires a pickaxe to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Concrete is formed when concrete powder comes into contact with a block of water (source block, flowing or waterlogged). It is not formed by contact with rain, filled cauldrons or water bottles. The bright and solid colors of concrete make

Sand is mined for many applications, but the largest use by far is for fine aggregate in concrete. Smaller quantities of sand are used for fracking, water treatment (filtration), metal casting, and making glass, silicon chips, and ceramics. Concrete consists of cement, water, fine aggregate (sand), and coarse aggregate (gravel).
