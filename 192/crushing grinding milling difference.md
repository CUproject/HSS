## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## Milling vs. Grinding - obsidianmfg
Milling says : Avoid interrupted cuts. An interrupted cut is one where the tool alternately enters and leaves the workpiece during the cut. Because cast iron has relatively low tensile strength, the tendency of the cutting forces it to break out the edge of the casting as the tool leaves the work.
