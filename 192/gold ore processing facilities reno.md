## Water Management in Gold Ore Processing - ScienceDirect
1. Introduction. Water is a key factor in the planning, design, operation, and closure cycle of any mine site or gold-processing facility. This chapter provides an overview of the commonly used water-management practices for gold-processing sites, including considerations for the site as a whole, and the factors that may need to be considered for the individual site facilities.

Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.
