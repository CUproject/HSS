## Common Types of Mining Equipment Used in the Mining Industry
Mar 25, 2021Rotary drill rigs create holes through rock or soil, allowing placement of charges for blasting open mines. A rotary drill rig is one of two main types of drills used for mining. The other type is a percussion or hammer drill. For a rotary drill rig, the drill bit turns under pressure to cut into the rock.

## What You Need To Know About Drilling and Blasting
Aug 18, 2021What is drilling and blasting? This is a process followed to break rock for excavation purposes, via controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics. Drilling and blasting is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering projects. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock-cut.

## BlastHole Drilling Introduction
In smaller holes, it is most common in softer rock formations. The drilling principle is to use a high pull down force (weight-on-bit), rotate the drill bit, and blow the rock cuttings to the surface with compressed air. Hardrock drills typically use the Rotary method to drill blastholes from 200 mm (7 7 /8") to 311 mm (12 Â¼") diameter.

## Drilling & Blasting of Underground Stopes
Heavy drifters mounted on a long cross-arm between two 3Â½-inch columns drill about 40 feet per machine shift in hard, massive sulfide ore. Holes are collared with 3-inch bits and gage reduction is 1/8 inch for each 2 feet of advance. Drilling practice in shrinkage and cut-and-fill stopes (both overhand systems) is similar.
