Mining is a dangerous profession. The traditional occupational hazards such as coal dust inhalation, damage to hearing due to the noise in a mine and chemical hazards still stand but the changing nature of mining has led to a raft of new issues. As mines are getting deeper, the risk of collapse has greatly increased.

Shaft mines are the deepest mines; a vertical shaft with an elevator is made from the surface down to the coal. In western Kentucky, one shaft mine reaches 1,200 feet below the surface. In room and pillar mining, the most common type of underground coal mining, coal seams are mined by a continuous miner that cuts a network of "rooms" into the seam.
