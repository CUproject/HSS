## Mining
Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe.The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron.Other precious metals were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts.

Chromite is an oxide mineral that an iron chromium oxide with formula: FeCr2O4. It is belonging to the spinel group. Chromite is the most important ore of chromium. Crystals are uncommon, but when found they are octahedral. Chromite is usually massive or in the form of lenses and tabular bodies, or it may be disseminated as granules.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

Iron can also be used to make minecarts, rails, compasses, anvils, cauldrons and buckets. Iron tools can be used up to 250 times before they break. Iron can also be used to craft iron blocks; 4 blocks of iron combined with a pumpkin head is the spawning recipe of the iron golem. Mining. Iron Ore requires a stone pickaxe or better to harvest.

## Impact of Particle Shape, Size, and Size Distribution on Gravity Flow 
6 days agoAn in-depth understanding of the gravity flow behaviour of broken ore is beneficial to improving the ore recovery in sublevel caving mines. In this study, granular dolomites were used as an analogue to experimentally explore the effect of the physical properties of fragments on the gravity flow behaviour of broken ore. Five groups of granular dolomites were prepared first. Then, the particle
