Next divide each side by 5252 and you end up with this equation: 1 Horsepower = Torque x R.P.M. / 5252. Because of this math, lb-ft of torque and horsepower will always be the same at 5,252 RPM.

Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

## What is horsepower (hp)? How to Calculate Horsepower | Groschopp
Horsepower = (3,000 x 6) / 63,025 = 0.286. 63,025 is a constant when using RPM for speed and in-lbf for torque units. 5,252 is another common constant if the speed is in RPM and torque is in ft-lbf. If the units are different then simply make the unit conversion. The derivation of these constants is done using the 33,000 ft-lbf /min = 1 horsepower.

## Screw Conveyor Horsepower | Engineering Guide - KWS Manufacturing
Horsepower is defined as the power required to safely and feasibly convey a bulk material a fixed distance in a screw conveyor. The horsepower required to drive a screw conveyor is called Total Shaft Horsepower, or TSHP. TSHP is a function of the characteristics of the bulk material being conveyed and the friction inherent in the screw conveyor
