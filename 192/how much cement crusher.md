## Often asked: How Many Yards In A Ton Of Crushed Concrete?
How many yards is a ton of gravel? Measuring the Driveway To measure the driveway in cubic feet, multiply the length by width by depth. For cubic yards, divide the total cubic feet by 27. Because one cubic yard of gravel is equal to 1.13 tons, you can multiply your total cubic yards by 1.13 to convert this measurement to tons.
