## Physical Bauxite Processing: Crushing and Grinding of Bauxite
Jan 23, 20223.1 Introduction to Crushing and Grinding of Bauxite. The most common initial process step to feed an alumina refinery with bauxite is the crushing or sizing of the raw bauxite material that is extracted from the mine. The feed material is crushed or sized so that it is conveyable, as well as correctly dimensioned, for the next step in the process.

The carbon anode is consumed in the pots. 5. Gases from pots are drawn off and. The aluminum industry is comprised of two basic operations: (1) the production of alumina (Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) from bauxite by the Bayer process, and (2) the reduction of alumina to aluminum metal by the Hall-Heroult electrolytic reduction process.

## Manufacturing of alumina through Bayer process - WorldOfChemicals
Bayer process of producing alumina can be divided into following four steps: i. Digestion: In this step of Bayer process, bauxite ore is crushed, milled and then heated with sodium hydroxide at the temperature of around degree Celsius. In the Bauxites, aluminium compounds are present as gibbsite (Al (OH) 3), boehmite (AlOOH) and
