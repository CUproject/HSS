## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
How is iron ore taken from the ground? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron (III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron (III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
