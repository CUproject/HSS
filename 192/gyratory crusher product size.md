## Advantages and Disadvantages of Gyratory Crusher over Jaw Crusher 
Disadvantages of gyratory crusher: (1) The gyratory crusher is twice the height of the jaw crusher, as a result of which, the construction expenditure of the plant is high. (2) The weight of this machine is 1.7~2 times higher than that of the jaw crusher with the same feeding size, so the investment fee is higher.

The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment).. This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. - As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.

The coarsely crushed material is then reduced to the desired product size in the crushing chamber below. Jaw gyratory crushers can handle much bigger chunks of material than comparable gyratory crushers of the same mantle diameter. Jaw gyratory crushers feature a higher crushing ratio and less tendency to become clogged in the feed zone as a

A primary gyratory crusher was required to crush iron ore at the rate of 3000 t/h. The largest size of the run-of-mine ore was 1000 mm. The required product size was less than 162 mm. Manufacturer's data indicated that the nearest size of gyratory crusher would be 1370 mm × 1880 mm with a cone angle of 18°.
