## Minnesota and coal - Global Energy Monitor
In 2006, Minnesota's coal-fired power plants produced 34.9 million tons of CO 2, more than 80,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, and 76,000 tons of nitrogen oxide; coal-fired power plants were responsible for 34.1% of the state's total CO 2 emissions. [2] In 2005, Minnesota emitted 19.9 tons of CO 2 per person, roughly equal to the U.S. average.

## New coal-fired power plants in India will be 'economically unviable'
Jun 3, 2021The IEEFA expects coal-fired capacity in India to peak at about GW by 2025 and it anticipates additions of 2-3GW of net new coal-fired capacity annually up until the mid-decade. But, amid the accelerating global retreat from coal, the agency believes those figures will only be possible if financing can be found.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.
