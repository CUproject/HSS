## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Jan 25, 2022Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest

## Some Problems in the Crushing and Grinding Stage of Mineral Processing
A reasonable grinding-classification process is mainly determined by the following factors: 1. Disseminated grain size and common characteristics of useful minerals and gangue minerals; 2. The hardness and density of useful ore and gangue minerals; 3. The argillization degree and oxidation of useful ore and gangue minerals;
