The steel mill is an industrial machine used to convert iron ingots into steel ingots. Steel mills convert iron ingots into steel ingots. There are a total of four slots inside the machine, each able to hold only one item - one for iron ingots and the other 3 for fuel. It takes approximately 20 seconds to completely transform an iron ingot into a steel ingot. The input conveyor must be

coal formation, to the present nearly devolatilized state of an anthra­ cite, with less than 2.5 per cent of oxgyen, deoxygenation has pro­ gressed continuously, though at varying rates, in every unweathered coal. As the original oxygen is more and more nearly eliminated, the heat efficiency of the coal increases.

Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal. By 1920, nearly 90% of US steel was produced using coke.
