However, since the end of the commodities super cycle at the end of 2014, global commodities prices have fallen partially due to a decrease in demand from China.

## China Economic Update - June 2021 - World Bank
China's economy will post strong growth in 2021. Assuming the continued suppression of COVID-19, growth is projected to reach 8.5 percent this year. For next year we expect growth to slow to 5.4 percent, as low base effects dissipate, and the economy returns to its pre-COVID trend growth, according to the latest China Economic Update.

## What is Aggregate Demand? - Robinhood
Sep 18, 2020Aggregate demand is a function of the individual market for every product in a marketplace. Aggregate demand is affected by macroeconomic factors such as inflation, exports, and interest rates. Microeconomic concepts like income levels and the availability of substitutes determine the demand for individual products.

Abstract This study uses the cointegration concept to analyze the long-run relationship of China's aggregate import demand function for the period . The conventional specification for the import demand function reveals that the volume of imports demanded responds to domestic activity and relative prices. This study considers four definitions of domestic activity, namely gross
