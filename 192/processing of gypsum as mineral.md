Rock Identification Tips. First, decide whether your rock is igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic. Igneous rocks such as granite or lava are tough, frozen melts with little texture or layering. Rocks like these contain mostly black, white and/or gray minerals . Sedimentary rocks such as limestone or shale are hardened sediment with sandy or clay.

## Gypsum Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.
