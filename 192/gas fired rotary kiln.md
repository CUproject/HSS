## Rotary Kiln Design: Direct Fired vs. Indirect Fired
Direct-fired kilns can be either of the co-current design, or counter current design, referring to the direction that the process gas flows through the drum in relation to the material. Direct-fired rotary kilns are most often the equipment of choice in thermal processing, because they are more efficient than their indirect counterparts. There

## Gas Kiln vs Electric kiln - The Main
Dec 2, 2020Gas kilns are the most widely used type of fuel fired kiln. Gas kilns offer the ability to control the atmosphere of your firing environment which directly impacts the quality of your fired pieces. The atmosphere effects both the way your glaze turns out as well as your clay bodies. A gas fueled kiln is very popular with modern ceramics artists.
