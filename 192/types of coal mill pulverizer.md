The ball and tube mills are low-speed machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder. Due to its shape only, people call it as Tube Mill and due to use of Grinding Balls for crushing, it is called Ball Mill. Hence, is the name Ball Tube Mill. These Mills are also designated as BBD-4772, Where- B - Broyer (Name
