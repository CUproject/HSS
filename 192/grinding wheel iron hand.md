Mount a metal cutoff wheel in your angle grinder. Prop up the long side of the rebar and hold it securely. Drop the cutoff wheel through the metal, allowing the weight of the tool to do most of the work. Allow the short end to drop freely to avoid binding the blade. If you're patient, you can cut most metal with a hacksaw.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface - abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.
