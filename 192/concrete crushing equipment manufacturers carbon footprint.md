## Curing of Concrete by Carbon-dioxide [PDF] - The Constructor
The curing carbonation process is an accelerated curing process that injects carbon-di-oxide into the vessel where the concrete elements are cured. The CO 2 is diffused in the fresh concrete under low pressure. During this process, the cement bogues compound C3S and C2S, and the by-products of hydration Ca (OH) 2 react with CO 2 giving solid

Young says a concrete mix using 60% portland cement, 20% fly ash, and 20% Calera SCMA has the same set time, workability, and strength gain as a regular 100% portland cement mix. But it has the same carbon footprint as a mix using 50% portland cement and 50% fly ash. The price of Calera SCMA will be comparable to portland cement.

## Carbon Footprint Factsheet | Center for Sustainable Systems
"A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or product."1 It is calculated by summing the emissions resulting from every stage of a product or service's lifetime (material production, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life). Throughout a product's lifetime, or lifecycle, different GHGs may be emitted
