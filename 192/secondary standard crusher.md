## Secondary Impact Crushers » MTM Crushing and Screening
Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm. Secondary jaw or cone crushers should be selected for hard and abrasive materials to maintain optimum operating costs.
