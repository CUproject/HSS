Quartz is an unusual mineral. It is stable below 573 degrees Centigrade, but between 573 and 870 degrees, tridymite, (another silica mineral,) forms.

## Arkansas Gemstones - Diamonds, quartz, turquoise and more! - Geology
In addition to rock crystal, Arkansas produces other quartz gem materials including agate, amethyst, chert, jasper, opal, petrified wood, novaculite, and smoky quartz. These are cut into faceted stones or cabochons and used in lapidary projects that include spheres, clock faces, beads, tumbled stones, and more.
