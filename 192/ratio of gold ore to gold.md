gold ores can be classified into 11 types (Table 1). Some metallurgical implications to these gold ore types are summarised below: Placers, quartz vein gold ores and oxidized ores: Generally, placers, quartz vein gold ores and oxidized ores are free-milling and gold can be recovered by gravity and/or direct cyanide leaching.

## Everything You Need to Know About the Process of Smelting Gold
This method of gold smelting uses a flux, a substance made of borax and sodium carbonate that removes impurities from gold. The first step is to buy a crucible container, used for holding the gold as it melts. This is a container created specifically for this process as it can withstand the heat used during the melting process.

The amount of tailings generated is dependent on the ore grade, (proportion of valuable minerals in the ore). For example, if the cut-off grade in the ore is 1 % Copper, 99 percent of the total ore would be deposited as tailings. Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores, often going over 50 per cent or more.

## Mining Ratios and Gold:Silver Ratios are very different
The "mining ratio" is the number of ounces of silver mined for every ounce of gold mined. Today, that ratio is somewhere around 8:1 (roughly 800,000,000 ounces of silver mined annually compared to roughly 96,000,000 ounces of gold). The "gold:silver ratio" is how many ounces of silver an ounce of gold can buy, determined by taking the price of
