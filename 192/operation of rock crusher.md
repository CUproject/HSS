What is a Jaw Crusher? As we introduced in a recent blog post about all the different types of crushing equipment available, jaw crushers are sometimes also referred to as "rock breakers," which speaks to their brute force. They are almost exclusively used as primary crushers because they excel at breaking up some of the largest and hardest materials into more manageable pieces for further

While in most crushers the jaw is pressed on the shaft and the latter swings in frame, in the jaw crusher the opposite principle is used—shaft is clamped in frame and jaw swings on the shaft! Another point has been lubrication.
