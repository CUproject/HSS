## Effect of Feed Rock Size Distribution on Crusher Performance
Primary crusher feeds usually fall under the "graded" category, and reduction crusher feeds under the "sized." Graded feeds may or may not have the under-size removed, depending upon the nature of the operation and of the material. Sized feed for reduction crushers is generally a screened feed which has definite maximum and minimum limits.

Working. These can crushers are powered by air pressure. This device is fitted with a pneumatic cylinder (pressurized tank) that pumps air with a tremendous force to set the crushing device into motion, which then falls onto the can. You have to just place the can in a chamber that is fitted with the crushing device.
