## Concentration of Ore Definition, Types and Properties of Ore - BYJUS
There are numerous methods of concentration and the methods are chosen based on the properties of the ore. Hydraulic Washing: This method concentrates the ore by passing it through an upward stream of water whereby all the lighter particles of gangue are separated from the heavier metal ore. This is a type of gravity separation. Magnetic
