## Mineral Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mineral extraction sites, which include strip mines, quarries, and underground mines, contribute to surface water and groundwater pollution, erosion, and sedimentation (see Chapter 14). The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock in order to remove the desired mineral ore (Fig. 12.6). The ore is then crushed into

For instance, a royalty rate of 12.5 percent for coal to be mined by surface mining methods and 8 percent for coal to be mined by underground mining methods is required. There is a diligent development requirement that means commercial quantities of coal must be produced from the lease within 10 years of lease issuance.
