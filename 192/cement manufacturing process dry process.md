## The Cement Manufacturing Process - Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are

DETAILED DRY PROCESS OF CEMENT MANUFACTURING - LCET ED . In dry and semi-dry processes for the manufacture of cement, raw materials are crushed and fed into the grinder in the correct proportions. The raw material is dried and reduced in size to a fine powder in a grinder. Dry powder is called a raw meal.

## process in manufacturing cement
The cement manufacturing is done by majorly by two methods known as wet process and dry process depending on their mixing is done with water or without water. The wet process of cement manufacturing too popular for several decades because of the possibility of more accurate control while raw material mixing.

The new dry-process cement production line technology was developed in the 1950s. So far, in Japan, Germany and other developed countries, the production rate of new dry-process cement clinker with suspension preheating and pre-decomposition as the core accounted for 95%. A suspension preheating and precalcining kiln was commissioned in 1976.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

whereas the dry cement process consumes 3609.75 MJ/ ton. The high energy consumption of the wet process over the dry can be attributed to the mix preparation method adopted prior to burning of clinker in the kiln (water being added to the raw materials to form raw thick slurry), whereas the dry process is only based on the preparation of fine powdered raw meal by grinding raw material followed
