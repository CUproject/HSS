## Using Recycled Concrete Aggregate | Specify Concrete
Crushed concrete has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first, since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.
