## Bampm compostofy
Composting is nature's way of recycling, turning your backyard garden waste into nutrient-rich compost soil over time. This particular composter is a tumbling and spinning composter design, which speeds up the composting process by aerating the soil with built-in mixing bars. Even better, this tumbling composter bin is built to last season.

## Assessment of groundwater inflows into Kuteshwar Limestone Mines 
The development of limestone mining activities in Katni, Madhya Pradesh becomes necessary to increase the depth of exploration to produce ore. Increase in the exploration depth means that mining pits were subjected to water inrush. A hydrological and a hydrogeological model for the Katni area have been developed using USGS flow code, MODFLOW 2000.
