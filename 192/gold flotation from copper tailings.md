## Ultimate Guide of Gold Flotation Process - Mining-pedia
Gold flotation process mainly includes the following steps: Preparation for the ore before gold flotation process. The raw ore is crushed, screened, ground and classified (sometimes need washing and desliming) to obtain the appropriate particle size, and then enters the flotation process stage. Add flotation reagent to flotation cell.

## Gold Flotation From Copper Tailings
Dressability of Old Gold. Feasibility of re-flotation of tailings is discussed It is found that short-term mechanical activation of tailings in a mill with the subsequent flotation (at the adjusted reagent mode as against the current technology) results in gold recovery of 29 0 to 45 4% in flotation concentrate at the residue content of metal in rejects at the level of 0 2-0 3 g/t

## Dressability of Old Gold-Bearing Tailings by Flotation
The research results on floatability of old gold-bearing tailings are presented. The complex material composition and process features of processing waste are governed by difference in treatment of various ore types (sulfide, oxidized and mixed) at processing plant, as well as with supergene processes in the tailings pond. Feasibility of re-flotation of tailings is discussed. It is found that
