## Convert Metric tons (or tonnes) to Cubic yards (t to yd³ Conversion)
We know that 1 t = 1.33 yd³ . So, to convert 50 t to yd³, multiply 50 t by 1.33 yd³. Therefore, 50 metric tons (or tonnes) converted to cubic yards is equal to 66.5 yd³. Convert 125 t to yd³. Therefore, 125 t converted to yd³ is equal to 166.25 yd³. For faster calculations, you can simply use our t to yd³ converter.
