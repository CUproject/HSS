## Alluvial gold: A geological model (Part 1) - Deposits Mag
Feb 13, 2021Though gold was won from hard-rock deposits in ancient times, most gold until perhaps 1900 was won from riverbeds, and was traditionally called alluvial or placer gold. Prospecting for alluvial gold required relatively little equipment and always attracted hardy pioneers willing to forego the comforts of society in the hope of 'getting rich

The geology of South Sudan is founded on Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, that cover 40 percent of the country's surface and underlie other rock units. The region was affected by the Pan-African orogeny in the Neoproterozoic and extensional tectonics in the Mesozoic that deposited very thick oil-bearing sedimentary sequences in rift basins. .

This study is a reconnaissance assessment of the alluvial gold deposits of the North Takhar Area of Interest (AOI) in Takhar Province, Afghanistan. Soviet and Afghan geologists collected data and calculated the gold deposit reserves in Takhar Province in the 1970s, prior to the development of satellite-based remote-sensing platforms and new methods of geomorphic mapping.

Alluvial mining is the mining of alluvial deposits of precious metals, either in rivers and river banks, or in now dry ancient river beds. Gold deposits found in rock formations in the mountains and along the rivers, disrupted through erosion, are displaced via flowing water from rain and washed downhill and concentrated in streams and rivers.
