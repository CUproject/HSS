The typical U.S. prep plant employs heavy media separation and was built in 1983. It has a raw capacity between 500 and 1,000 tons per hour. Although more plants are employing large diameter cyclones, the plants still rely mainly on heavy-media vessels for primary separation and heavy media cyclones for intermediate separation.

## Heavy Media Separation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
39.3.3 Heavy media separation. Heavy media separation dates back to several centuries. Initially, a fine magnetite was used as a heavy media. In 1936, a plant was designed employing organic liquid as a heavy media for treating anthracite coal containing ore. The heavy media process is usually used for treatment of coarse coal above 9.5 mm in size.
