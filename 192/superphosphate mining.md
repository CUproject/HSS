## John Bennet Lawes- The Inventor of Superphosphate Fertilizer
By the way, he developed a method of producing the fertilizer which he patented in 1842. In this method, superphosphate is produced by mixing calcium phosphate (phosphate rock) with sulfuric acid to produce a superphosphate (Ca (H2PO4)2) substance. Based on his history, John Lawes was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England on December 28, 1814.

Nauru an island in the South Pacific is famous for it mining sties much of the soil was mined and much of the environment was destroyed. One of the side affect of using superphosphate is that earth worms can not live in the superphosphate soil. As a result super soils will not have the structure and nutrients which worm provide.

2. Superphosphate hits earthworm numbers. Earthworms are not harmed by superphosphate applications at normal rates. The increase in plant growth after fertilising will encourage a higher worm population. Earthworms prefer a pH of 5.6 to 6.2, so if the soil is more acid than this, a lime application will increase worm numbers.

Triple Superphosphate Triple superphosphate (TSP) was one of the first high-analysis phosphorus (P) fertilizers that became widely used in the 20th century. Technically, it is known as calcium dihydrogen phosphate and as monocalcium phosphate, [Ca(HâPOâ)â .HâO]. Despite its excellent history as a P source, its use has declined as other P fertilizers have become more popular.
