River Sand River Sand obtained from the banks and beds of rivers is also coarse and fine. Coarse sand is best for use in construction works. 16. Sea Sand This sand is obtained from the shore of sea. The shape of this sand is rounded. Due to water of sea it mixes with different chemicals. 17. Stone Dust This is the 2nd type of fine aggregate.

## What is Fine Aggregate - Types and Uses
Fine aggregate is basically any normal sand particle that comes from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4″ or smaller. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4″ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. Fine Aggregate.

Coarse sand and fine sand are part of quarry like other materials that excavated from the ground such as rock, stone, riprap, aggregate, slate or gravel. Sand is actually some grainy materials made by mineral and rock particles, much coarser than silt and finer when compared to gravel, when it is measured by size.
