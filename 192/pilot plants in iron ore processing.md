## pilot plants in iron ore processing
2020 7 15 The pilot plant which cost US 3 million is the first step towards the construction of an industrial plant that will have a production capacity of 1.5 million metric tons per year The investment in this project is near US 100 million and the commercial plant start up is scheduled for 2022 processing of the iron ore produced in Brazil
