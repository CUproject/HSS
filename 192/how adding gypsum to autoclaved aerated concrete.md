## Autoclaved aerated concrete
Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a lightweight, precast, foam concrete building material suitable for producing concrete masonry unit like blocks. Composed of quartz sand (SiO 2 with impurities), calcined calcium sulfate (or plaster of paris), lime (CaO), cement, water and aluminum powder, AAC products are cured under heat and pressure in an autoclave.

## Sustainable Management of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Wastes in Gypsum 
Promoting the use of gypsum and gypsum-based materials in construction is a successful strategy from an environmental point of view; it allows a lower energy demand with a sensible reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, the manufacturing of gypsum products can represent an interesting sector to redirect and manage the large amount of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) waste.

## Sustainable Management of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Wastes in Gypsum 
Mar 10, 2021Promoting the use of gypsum and gypsum-based materials in construction is a successful strategy from an environmental point of view; it allows a lower energy demand with a sensible reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, the manufacturing of gypsum products can represent an interesting sector to redirect and manage the large amount of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) waste.
