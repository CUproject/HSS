## Sand Unit Weight or Specific Weight - Calculation - Civil Engineering
Unit weight or Specific Weight of sand is calculated by the product of the density of sand and the standard gravity of sand. According to the US customary measurement system, dry weighs 1.631 gram per cubic centimeter, this density is equal to 101.8 pounds per cubic foot [lb/ft³].
