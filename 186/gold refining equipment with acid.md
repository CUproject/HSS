Example : current gold price $54,885 USD (1kg). After smelting process 1000 grams of 22 carat metal will be reduced to 990 grams of metal with purity of 995%. I.e. (990 grams x 995 purity / 1000 = 985.05 pure gold). If you multiply 985.05 pure gold x 54.88 (current market price, per gram) = USD 54,059.54.
