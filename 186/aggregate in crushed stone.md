## How do you make a gravel floor?
The area where you want to lay the gravel needs to be excavated to a depth of about 10 inches. The excavated area should then be filled with about 4 inches of base material, such as crushed limestone. Once the base material is in place, you can begin adding the pea gravel. The gravel should be added in layers no thicker than 2 inches.
