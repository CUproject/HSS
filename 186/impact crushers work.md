## Impact Crusher for Soft Materials | DASWELL
How does an impact crusher work? Driven by the electric motor, the rotor inside the impact crusher rotates at high speed. When the material enters the plate hammer crushing zone, it is crushed by impact with the plate hammer and then thrown to the liner plate to be crushed again. Then it bounces back to the plate hammer area from the liner

## Tips to maximize impact crushing efficiency
Impact crushers do not run on the choke fed theory. Jaws and cones need to be choke fed as they work on gravity and compression. Where as impact crushers work on actual impact force (inertia) from the rotor blow bars that impacts the rock sends it at speed into the impact aprons. If you are over feeding the chamber you will reduce the rotors
