## Pyrolysis Tire Recycling System, The Way It Works - Beston Company
A tire pyrolysis recycling method is one that involves the heating of shredded or whole tires in an oxygen-free chamber. The shredded or whole tires are softened within the reaction chamber causing the disintegration of rubber polymers into smaller molecules. Due to their small size, the small molecules can easily evaporate and escape the reactor.

## Recycling of Waste Tire Resources: Full of Potential Beston Pyrolysis Plant
Pyrolysis Equipment Installed in Nigeria. High Efficiency: 1. The batch plant doesn't need tyre shredding process and feeds the whole tire into the reactor, which not only saves the cost of investing tire shredding equipment, but also saves labor and energy. 2. The waste tyre pyrolysis plant adopts high-efficiency and rapid pyrolysis reactor

## Waste Tyre Recycling Plant Project Report - Plastic/Tire Pyrolysis Oil 
The Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million scrap tires were generated in 2003. Of the 290 million, 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire re-treads. The United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from million in 1994, down to 275 million tires in 2004 primarily due
