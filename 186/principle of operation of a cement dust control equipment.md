## Industrial Dust Collectors and Dust Collection Systems
In nearly every industrial facility, a dust collection system is a vital component for efficient operation. Their operation, reliability and efficiency directly impact profits at your facility (e.g. System downtime, high energy costs, lost production, environmental/workplace safety fines, etc.).

The most basic purification principle is to apply wet dust removal, water film desulfurization and dust removal, impact water bath desulfurization and dedusting and other technical principles to the desulfurization dust collector's technology and equipment. It has a good effect on the waste gas pollution of some industrial factories.

## What Is An Industrial Dust Collector and How Does it Work?
Dust collector systems work in general by drawing dust and particulates from the air through a filter that first captures and separates the matter and then discharges purified air back into the workplace or environment. The objective of each design application is essentially the same—to filter, separate, and capture dust and particulate

## Cyclonic separation
Cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air, gas or liquid stream, without the use of filters, through vortex separation. When removing particulate matter from liquid, a hydrocyclone is used; while from gas, a gas cyclone is used. Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids. The method can also be used to separate fine droplets of
