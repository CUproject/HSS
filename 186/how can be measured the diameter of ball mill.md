## Ball Mill Design/Power Calculation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The ball mill motor power requirement calculated above as 1400 HP is the power that must be applied at the mill drive in order to grind the tonnage of feed from one size distribution. The following shows how the size or select the matching mill required to draw this power is calculated from known tables 'the old fashion way'.

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.

8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses, Advantages and
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

##  The Complexity of Controlling the Particle Size in Chocolate - PMCA
18. Can you use different sizes of balls in a ball mill to simulate size distribution from roll refiner? Different sizes of balls in one-ball mill will not work. You can have different ball mills refining different fineness and, by mixing these, mimicking bi-modal particle distribution.
