## Scrubber
Scrubber systems (e.g. chemical scrubbers, gas scrubbers) are a diverse group of air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams. An early application of a carbon dioxide scrubber was in the submarine the Ictíneo I, in 1859; a role for which they continue to be used today.. Traditionally, the term "scrubber" has referred

## Do scrubbers remove ash?sewing
What is inside a scrubber? Inside a wet scrubber, the scrubbing liquid used may be sea water or fresh water with chemical additives. The most commonly used additives used are caustic soda (NaOH) and Limestone (CaCO3). Scrubbing liquid is sprayed into the exhaust gas stream through nozzles to distribute it effectively.

Wet scrubbers can remove particulate matter by capturing them in liquid droplets. The droplets are then collected, with the liquid dissolving or absorbing the pollutant gases.  How effective are coal scrubbers? Reality: Scrubbers are very efficient air pollution control devices, and can remove greater than 95 percent of the SO2 from power

Coal is still a major energy source, mostly used in power plants. However, the coal combustion emits harmful SO 2 and fly ash. Wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) technology is extensively used to control SO 2 emissions in power plants. However, only limited studies have investigated the synergistic dust removal by the WFGD system.

## Wet dust scrubbing - general | EMIS
In wet dust scrubbing, the dust is separated by intensively mixing flue gases with water. For further information please refer to the relevant technique sheets. Design data. The liquid-gas ratio (L/G) in a dust scrubber is the relationship between the volume of scrubbing liquid and the volume of gas flow. For dimensioning purposes, and to
