## Ammonia, uranium milling process
 This work reports a three-step process for synthesizing UN at temperatures below 1200 °C. UO 2 is first converted to tetravalent ammonium uranium fluorides at 20 °C by ball-milling with solid ammonium bifluoride. Then, these ammonium uranium fluoride species are reacted with an ammonia atmosphere at 800 °C.

The ore is crushed in a mill and ground to a fine slurry. Acid is added to the slurry to remove the uranium from the other minerals.  The uranium conversion process for CANDU heavy water reactors involves converting UO 3 to uranium dioxide  Ontario, at Canada's only uranium conversion facility. Nitric acid and ammonia are added to UO 3,

Hydrometallurgy is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy, the obtaining of metals from their ores.Hydrometallurgy involve the use of aqueous solutions for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. Processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy, vapour metallurgy, and molten salt electrometallurgy.

## Conventional Uranium Mills | NRC.gov
A conventional uranium mill is a chemical plant that extracts uranium using the following process: Trucks deliver uranium ore to the mill, where it is crushed into smaller particles before being extracted (or leached). In most cases, sulfuric acid is the leaching agent, but alkaline solutions can also be used to leach the uranium from the ore.

The milling process involves crushing and pulverizing the rock into very fine fragments and adding water to create a slurry. This slurry is then mixed with sulfuric acid or an alkaline solution to release the uranium from the host rock. Normally approximately 95 - 98% of the uranium can be recovered from the host rock.
