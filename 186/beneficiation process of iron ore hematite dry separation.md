## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

## hematite iron beneficiation
The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

##  Chapter-8 Beneficiation of Iron Ores
Magnetic Separation is one of the physical concentration processes that utilizes the differences in magnetic properties of various minerals present in the ore body. The magnetic fraction may be valuable or gangue depending upon its end use in a particular process and so also the non-magnetic fraction, e.g., separation of magnetite (magnetic)
