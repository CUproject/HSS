Gold Leaching Process. At many operating gold plants, an increase in gold dissolution is observed when a leach slurry is transferred from one type of process equipment to another (i.e., between leach tanks, thickeners, filters, pumps, and pipelines).

## USB2 - Method for leaching gold - Google Patents
In a method for leaching gold from copper sulfides, the sulfide ores are first subjected to leaching of copper, thereby producing a leaching residue having 7.9% or less of the copper content. This leaching residue is mixed with a leach liquor, which contains the chloride ion and ferric ion and has 1.9 or less of pH. Gold and copper can be effectively leached from the copper sulfide ores.

One example of a leaching process that uses vat leaching is gold cyanidation, the process of extracting gold from low-grade ores. In this process, a dilute solution of sodium cyanide (NaCN) is used to leach the Au into solution. The concentration is usually 0.01-0.05 % cyanide, or ppm.

Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide, no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative. A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH.

The gold is mixed with the sodium cyanide which leads to the following Elsener's equation and reaction. This is done to make soluble gold; Now the gold is soluble. This method of making soluble gold is known as leaching. In the process of leaching, a dilute form of sodium cyanide is added into the ore containing the gold.

## How do you leach gold without cyanide?hcharge
Thiosulphate leaching is a process that removes gold from gold bearing ores without the use of cyanide. Although not as aggressive a leaching agent as cyanide, thiosulphate offers several technological advantages including its lower toxicity and greater efficiency with gold deposits associated with preg-robbing ores.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## Leaching Process - Examples, Types, Advantages and Disadvantages - VEDANTU
Leaching Process Examples. The leaching process example includes the leaching of bauxite or Al2O3 . 2H₂O with the concentrated and heated sodium hydroxide. The concentrated NaOH here tends to dissolve the aluminium present in the given bauxite, while on the other hand, the impurities like SiO2, TiO2, and Fe2O3 do not get dissolved.
