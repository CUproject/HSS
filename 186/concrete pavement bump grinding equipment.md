Feb 22, 2021Concrete grinding cost depends on the area you are working on and the geographical location of course. Source: homeguide. Usually, it may cost you around 3$ to 12$ per square foot to polish concrete. Usually, the cost of dry grinding of concrete is more expensive. On the other hand, wet grinding of concrete is cheaper.

## Diamond Grinding - ACPA
Diamond grinding is done with specially designed equipment that uses gang-mounted diamond saw blades to cut through bumps in the concrete surface. In essence, the function of diamond grinding equipment is similar to that of a common wood plane. The saw blades shave off the fault or bump and the rear wheels follow behind in the smoothened path.
