## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) for Concrete -Properties and Advantages
Advantages of Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) It is well graded in the required proportion. It does not contain organic and soluble compound that affects the setting time and properties of cement, thus the required strength of concrete can be maintained. It does not have the presence of impurities such as clay, dust and silt coatings, increase water

## The benefits of using manufactured sand with cement for peat 
The traditional use of cement for soil stabilisation is challenged by peat due to the high organic content in peat and the associated unfavourable environmental and economic impacts. This study explores the potential and benefits of using manufactured sand, an economical, easily accessible and environmentally friendly construction material, with cement for peat stabilisation. Experiments were

As the cement and water mix, they harden and bind the aggregates into an impenetrable rock-like mass. Therefore: Cement + Aggregates + Water = Concrete.
