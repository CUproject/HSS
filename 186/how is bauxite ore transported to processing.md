## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the Products in Between)
An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.

The first step of the Bayer process is to use the crushing equipment to crush the bauxite ore into particles with a diameter of about 30 mm. As the particle size becomes smaller, the specific surface area of the bauxite greatly increases, which helps to speed up the follow-up speed of the chemical reaction.
