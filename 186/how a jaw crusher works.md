In a double-toggle jaw crusher, the moving crusher jaw is driven by the eccentric shaft that moves the front and rear toggles up and down. Each shaft revolution causes the moving crusher jaw to close at the downstroke and open up during the upstroke. The toggle is kept in place by spring-loaded tension rod.

Jaw crushers Jaw crushers are used for coarse grinding brittle, me-dium-hard to hard materials up to a Mohs' hardness of approx. 8.5. Here reduction ratios of up to 1:100 are pos-sible depending on the actual model concerned. Comminution in the jaw crusher takes place in a wedge-shaped crushing chamber between a fixed and flex-ible crushing jaw.

How Jaw Crusher Works. The distinctive feature of jaw crusher is the two plates which open and shut like animal jaws. The jaws are set at an acute angle to each other, and one jaw is pivoted so that it swings relative to the other fixed jaw. Material fed into the jaws is alternately nipped and released to fall further into the crushing chamber.
