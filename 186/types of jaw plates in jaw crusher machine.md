High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance. However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.
