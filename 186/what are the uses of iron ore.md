## How is Iron Extracted from Iron Ore | Actforlibraries
Iron is an element that has the chemical symbol, Fe. It is a metal that has been used since prehistory, by the Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians as early as 4000 B.C. These ancient peoples were able to get pure iron from meteorites that fell to the earth, and they used it in the tips of weapons and spears because of its strength and durability.

Iron ore prices averaged over USD 130 per metric ton in 2013. Last year they averaged just over USD 58 per metric ton. Iron ore prices have plummeted this year. October's price was 22.6% lower on a year-to-date basis. Behind the recent plunge in prices is a subdued outlook for demand amid a healthy supply of iron ore.

In this route of iron making, the use of noncoking coal or natural gas is made as reductant for iron ore. The oil is used for heat hardening of iron ore pellets which is generally exploited by gas-based DRI plants. The coal-based DRI units generally require lump ore which need some electrical energy during crushing and sizing operations.
