## What is the Beneficiation Process?
Oct 1 2014. The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained

## Mining industry of Botswana
The mining industry of Botswana has dominated the national economy of Botswana since the 1970s. Diamond has been the leading component of the mineral sector since large-scale diamond production began in 1972 by Debswana.Most of Botswana's diamond production is of gem quality, resulting in the country's position as the world's leading producer of diamond by value.
