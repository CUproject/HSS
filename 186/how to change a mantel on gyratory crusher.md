A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates (rotates) within a cone shaped inner surface lined with wear resisting plates often called concaves. As the mantle gyrates within the crushing chamber, progressively approaching, and receding from, each element of the cone shaped inner surface, it creates compressive force, which fractures the .

## How do a gyratory crusher work?
The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate.
