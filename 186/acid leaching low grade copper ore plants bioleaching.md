## Heap Leaching and Heap Bioleaching - MINTEK | MINTEK
Mintek has developed considerable experience in heap leaching and heap bioleaching, and has undertaken an advanced research programme investigating the high-temperature heap bioleaching of low-grade chalcopyrite. This has culminated in the design, commissioning and operation of the copper heap bioleaching pilot plant shown below.

## Bioleaching: metal solubilization by microorganisms
Bioleaching is a simple and effective technology for metal extraction from low-grade ores and mineral concentrates. Metal recovery from sulfide minerals is based on the activity of chemolithotrophic bacteria, mainly Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and T. thiooxidans, which convert insoluble metal sulfides into soluble metal sulfates. Non-sulfide ores

##  Recovery of copper values from bio-heap leaching of low grade  - CHERIC
current production of lean copper ores in India is 0.55 million tons with ~0.3% average copper content. Heap-bioleaching of the lean copper ores in 15 and 30 ton scales was undertaken at IMMT, Bhubaneswar. The leaching study showed 0.09% dissolution of copper from the ore body per day. The leach liquor was processed through solvent extraction and

Nickel agromining utilizes hyperaccumulator plants ("metal crops") to extract nickel from low-grade soils, a process that yields high-grade nickel bio-ore. This feedstock is further processed into a range of nickel products. The bio-ore is relatively free of impurities that complicate the traditional processing of laterite nickel ores.

## Column Bioleaching of Fluoride-Containing Secondary Copper Sulfide Ores 
Bioleaching is a mature technology, which is widely employed commercially in the leaching of primary sources of metals (ores, concentrates, and mine residues). The current work discussed the effects of aluminum sulfate additions to the growth medium, PLS recirculation and bleeding on the column bioleaching of secondary copper sulfide ores with a significant content of fluoride-containing minerals.

## Methods of Metal Recovery by Microorganisms (2 Methods)
Method # 1. Bioleaching: In microbial leaching (bioleaching), metals can be extracted from large quantities of low grade ores. Although recovery of metals (e.g. copper) from the drainage water of mines has been known for centuries, the involvement of microbes in this process was recognized about 40 years ago.
