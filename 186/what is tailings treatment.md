the tailings storage facilities are surrounded by perimeter roads, and a perimeter drain. This drain collects surface runoff from the embankment and directs it into collection/silt ponds. Depending on the water quality, this water is either discharged to natural water or pumped back to the water treatment plant.

Mine Tailings Treatment. Mine tailings treatment is based on the size of tailings, graded treatment, graded use, that is, the hydrocyclone graded coarse sand (about 40%) filling the underground goaf and tail sand filling filling column, efficient centrifugation Filter filter, the dry sand stacked in the vicinity of the plant on the hillside, and the cover soil.

The dam was designed to survive a once-in-1000-years flood (300 mm of rainfall per day) but a once-in-2000-years flood occurred in August 1975, following the collision of Typhoon Nina and a cold front. The typhoon was blocked for two days before its direction ultimately changed from northeastward to westward.

## Tailings Dams: What You Need To Know - ProjectsIQ
Tailings dams are used to store water and waste that come as by products from the mining process. Tailings dams can be massive - the size of a lake reaching up to 300 metres high. As the slurry of waste is piped into the dam, the solids settle to the bottom and the water is recycled to be used in the separation process again.

Froth treatment tailings (FTT) are a specific type of tailings waste stream from the bitumen froth treatment process that contains bioavailable diluent: either naphtha or paraffins. Tailings ponds that receive FTT are associated with the highest levels of biogenic gas production, as diverse microbial communities biodegrade the residual diluent.

## Tailings
In mining, tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.. The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which

Tailings ponds are normally located in a part of the lease that has little or no bitumen. Tailings produced in Extraction and Froth Treatment normally contain about 50% water. These tailings streams are pumped out to the tailings pond, where the solids settle to the bottom of the pond and clarified water is pumped back to the main processing plant.

## Water Management Considerations for Conventional Storage - Tailings
The risk of physical instability for a conventional tailings facility can be reduced by having good drainage and little (if any) ponded water. Simply put, 'no water, no problem'. Water management of a tailings facility not only involves the superficial water flows but the interception, collection and treatment of seepage.
