Nov 12, 2021Copper has been used for about 10,000 years and more. An axe was made in 3300 BCE for Otzi the Iceman. 2. At that time when the axe was found, the head was made of almost pure copper. It was said that this indicates the iceman was directly involved with the process of smelting copper. 3. The coloring of copper is metallic-reddish and unique.

## COâ‚‚ Emissions - Sustainable Copper
May 4, 2021Copper mining firms worldwide are committed to reducing their carbon emissions. Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper miners, lowered its carbon emissions by more than 21 percent from 2015 to 2019. This puts the company on track to meet the COP21 framework to limit global warming to below 2Â°C from pre-industrial levels by 2050.

##  Recovery of Copper by Solution Mining Methods - Arizona
A Brief History of Copper Recovery by Solu-tion Mining Methods As early as the 1670, copper-bearing mine waters at the Rio Tinto mine in Spain were known to chemically precipitate copper onto iron (Arbiter and Fletcher, 1994). This process became known as the "cementation process", which is apparently derived from the Spanish word
