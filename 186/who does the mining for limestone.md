## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

May 16, 2021How does the mining of limestone affect the environment? When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground, caves and gullies form, a natural phenomenon known as karst. Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form, once the limestone is mined out, sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.

## How limestone is extracted?ntal
How does limestone get extracted? Most limestone and dolomite are mined from open quarries, although in many areas economic and environmental considerations favor large-scale production by underground mining.  The basic operations in underground mining are drilling, blasting, loading and hauling, scaling and roof bolting.
