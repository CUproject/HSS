## Artisanal and Small-scale Mining | LandLinks
Mar 1, 2021Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), which refers to mining with minimal or no mechanization often in the informal sector, has increasingly captured the interest of governments, international organizations, and private corporations because of its growing role in national economies and its impacts on society and the environment. The artisanal mining sector also provides new opportunities

May 14, 20221. Introduction. The artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) method is one of the essential rural non-agricultural livelihood activities in the developing world, providing jobs for millions of people directly and indirectly (Hilson, 2016).ASM involves exploiting mineral deposits using basic or rudimentary tools and primitive mining and processing techniques (Bansah et al., 2016).

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## How to start small scale mining in Ghana even if you have little 
Unlike large scale mining where intensive labor, technology and experience is a major factor, small scale mining offers a simple way to carry out mining. Small scale mining is usually done on areas with little mineral deposits near the earth surface. It requires simple small-scale mining methods to excavate the minerals.
