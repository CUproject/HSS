## Making Concrete for Use in Water Well Construction: The Basics
Concrete is made from cement, sand, gravel and water. In making concrete strong, these ingredients should usually be mixed in a ratio of 1:2:3:0.5 to achieve maximum strength. That is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 3 parts gravel, and 0.5 part water. (See figure 6). (A ''part'' means a unit of measure. Technically, it should be based on weight

## What Is the Ratio of Portland Cement to Rock & Sand?
For instance, a concrete mix for foundation walls or a base for paving slabs consists of one part Portland cement, 2.5 parts sand, 3.5 parts gravel and 0.5 parts water. For foundation footings, mix one part Portland cement, three parts sand and five parts gravel plus enough water to make it pour easily. For outdoor paving of walks or driveways

## C35 Concrete | PAV2 Concrete | The Concrete Network
What is C35 / PAV2 Concrete Used For? With a strength rating of 35 newtons after 28 days, C35 / PAV2 concrete is most commonly used when building heavy-duty pavements and external slabs. This designation of concrete is similar to PAV1 Concrete mixes (also designated as C30/ST3 ), but is much stronger and more suitable for heavy duty applications.

In terms of the ratio for concrete, it depends on what strength you are trying to achieve, but as a general guide a standard concrete mix would be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 4 parts aggregates. For foundations, a mix of 1 part cement to 3 parts sand to 6 parts aggregates can be used.

Some of the concrete we poured back in the 1940s is still holding up. Avoid getting the concrete very sloppy in the mixer. Concrete that is poured fairly dry will be stronger than the sloppy stuff. Pour the water in the mixer first out of a bucket so you can tell exactly how much you put in there.
