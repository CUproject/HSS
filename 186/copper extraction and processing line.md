## Copper extraction
The Old Copper Complex in North America has been radiometrically dated to 9500 BP—i.e., about 7480 BCE—making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world. The earliest evidence of cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at Çayönü Tepesi in eastern Anatolia, which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE. Among the various items considered to be votive

## copper extraction and purification - chemguide
Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

## Processing of copper anodic-slimes for extraction of valuable metals 
The anodic slimes are characterized by high concentrations of copper, lead, tin and silver. The proposed hydrometallurgical process consists of two leaching stages for the extraction of copper (H 2 SO 4 -O 2) and silver (thiourea-Fe 3+ ), and pyrometallurgical treatment of the remaining slimes for production of Pb-Sn soldering alloy.

The copper extracted from this process is mixed with the slag and is called Matte Copper due to its texture and appearance. This mainly consists of Cu2S which is reduced to pure metal by blasting Matte Copper with air. Cu 2 S+O 2 → 2Cu+SO 2. The sulphur dioxide escapes the copper and this causes bubbles to appear and burst as SO2 leaves. This
