## What are the effects of sand and stone winning on our environment 
As a process of land degradation, sand winning destroys the soil profile, damages soil surface configuration and changes topography of the land (Mehta et al., 2007). Together, sand and gravel constitute the primary raw materials for the construction of roads, bridges, houses, factories, schools, markets and offices.
