Most industrial wastewater treatment plants use chemical oxygen demand (COD) rather than the BOD5 test. Due to the length of time required to complete the BOD5 test (five days), BOD results provide historical data only and do not facilitate rapid water quality assessment for optimal process control.

Floating plants do a lot of good. But they can also interfere with our filters, other aquatic plants, and even our fish! Floating Plants and Filtration. Keeping floating plants away from the filter intake and outflow is important because the plants can easily disrupt the filter - and be disrupted by it. Take a moment to look at your plants.

Efficiency = [ (IN - Out)/IN] x 100. Plugging in our numbers and doing the math we see that we take our 245 mg per liter and subtract from that the 22. Then we divide by 245 which is what's coming in. When we multiply that by 100 we see that this wastewater treatment plant is removing 91% of the incoming BOD.

Generally, a WIX air filter doesn't show any defects or sigh of replacement till the vehicle is driven at least 30000 miles. It may survive 50000 miles often. On the other side, the Purolator air filter lacks more longevity than the WIX air filter. It lasts for 12000 miles which are approximately 1 year in the average time.

## Why You Should Put a Coffee Filter in the Bottom of Your Potted Plants
Place a coffee filter on the bottom of the pot, between your plant's dirt and the pot's drainage hole, where the water and dirt combo usually comes out. That's it, the end. Simple right? When you do this, the filter allows water to drain, but the dirt to stay in tact and not leak out. This matters because when dirt comes out of the hole

## Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) Stormwater Treatment
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is often used to measure organic matter in wastewater, treated effluent, and receiving waters. Although COD measures more than organic constituents, the organic fraction usually predominates and is the constituent of interest.

## COD and BOD Reduction of Domestic Wastewater using Activated Sludge 
The schematic diagram of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) is presented in Fig. 1.. Analytical procedure: The raw wastewater samples were collected from the main outlet of wastewater from the Technical College. The raw water samples were passed through different steps as indicated in Fig. 1 for the removal of COD and BOD. The treated and untreated wastewater samples were collected on weekly

## The Best Winter Hardy Pond Plants (Cold Weather Species)
Zones 1a to 7a experience average annual extreme minimum winter temperatures as low as -60 degrees Fahrenheit to 0°F, respectively (essentially, these zones often have winter temperatures below zero degrees), while zones 7b to 13b range from 0 to 70°F, respectively (with 7b being 5 to 10°F and 13b ranging from 65 to 70°F).

## Bog filter flow rate - Ozponds
Size of the bog filter. The size of a bog filter can be as little as 10% of the ponds volume or surface area, right up to 50%. I like to create up flow bog filters. Those are more effective as the water is forced up through the rocks and gravel. A bog filter designed in this way is easy to maintain and clean. A filter like this shouldn't
