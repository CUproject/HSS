## Granite Gold 24 oz. Daily Multi-Surface Countertop Cleaner for Granite 
Sep 14, 2022I received Granite Gold Daily Cleaner for free to give my honest opinion about this product. Granite Gold products are great for granite, marble, travertine and all other natural-stone and quartz surfaces and for ceramic and tile etc. I use Granite Gold because It helps protects my furniture with marble tops and keeps it beautiful and shiny.

## Gold in Quartz - February 2016 (Vol. 85, No. 06) - ICMJ
February 2016 by Chris Ralph. Most prospectors, when they think of hard rock gold deposits, think of quartz containing particles of gold.

## Quartz vs. Granite Countertops: A Complete Comparison - Kitchen Infinity
Yes, quartz does scratch more easily than granite. This is because around 6-7% of quartz is man-made polymers and resins, so the overall material is less stable and tends to be a bit more flexible than granite. When you scratch a quartz counter, the flexibility of this resin can make scratches easier to inflict.
