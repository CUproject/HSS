## Principles of Modern Grinding Technology | ScienceDirect
Precision grinding machines, as with all production machines, are subject to wear. This means there must be a program of planned maintenance or checking for sustained quality and output. Some machine designs are less prone to the effects of wear than others are, and this can be an important consideration in machine selection.

## 3 Principles of Choosing the Crushing and Grinding Process
Principle 1：More Crushing and Less Grinding. Crushing is mainly realized by the crushing equipment's extrusion and impact on the material. While grinding mainly depends on the impact, milling and denudation of the grinding equipment. There into, grinding is an operation with low efficiency and high energy consumption.
