## Can we add fly ash to cement while calculating the water cement ratio 
Answer (1 of 2): I asked this very question to my teacher back in Engineering, to which she replied that fly ash should be counted in as fine aggregate since fly ash, much like gravels/aggregates does not posses any adhesion properties. The W/C ratio is used to calculate strength of concrete and

Results of this study indicated that the 50% fly ash replacement of Portland cement increased the rupture modulus of the recycled concrete. Conversely, a mixture with over 50% cement replacement by either fly ash or slag or a combination of both exhibited detrimental effect on the compressive strength, rupture modulus, and drying shrinkage.

## Fly Ash instead of Cement - Concrete Decor
Fly ash is a pozzolan — to make cement, just add water. Combined with lime and water, it forms a mixture that is similar to portland cement. But it is just an additive, rather than a replacement for portland cement. It is routinely used in 15 percent to 25 percent dosages in ready mix. Like slag, fly ash is not a new development in the

## Using Fly Ash in Concrete - Precast
Both class C fly ash and slag have about 35 percent silica and much lower calcium oxide than portland cement. In most cases, lower calcium oxide means better durability.

With cement being the costliest ingredient, substituting fly ash or slag can help maintain a stronger mix at a lower cost. Fly ash and Slag will typically be 18% cheaper than Portland cement. When a mix includes 20% fly ash, this will provide savings of 3.5% in cost. The advantage of slag is its ability to substitute more of cement.

## The Difference in Slag Cement and Fly Ash
Once a good relationship with a supplier is established, slag cement can be used at a higher percentage than fly ash. In most cases, slag cement can be used as a 30-50% replacement to portland cement, reducing the carbon impact of the concrete. To check for suppliers in your area, use the SCA's slag cement locator.

## Fly Ash and Innovation in Concrete - CarbonCure
Aug 11, 2022Years of research show that fly ash can decrease concrete's carbon footprint—and its cost—while increasing its strength and workability. Fly ash is typically less expensive than cement, making it a very important ingredient in concrete mix designs for most concrete producers.  Slag. Slag is a by-product of steel production. Slag reacts
