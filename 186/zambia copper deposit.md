pyrite forms near the reduced rocks. Native copper occurs in deposits deficient in sulfide. Native silver is common. Some deposits in Zambia and Republic of Congo contain carrollite, Co-pyrite and Ge minerals. Texture/Structure Minerals are finely disseminated, stratabound, locally stratiform. Framboidal or colloform pyrite is common.

## Mining in Zambia: Copper & Gold Deposits
Zambia is known for its copper, but it is also a great gold producer with a number of active mines. It is a good country for anyone interested in mining in Africa, particularly because a lot of potential gold deposits are yet to be explored while at the same time the country has enjoyed a stable political system for a long period of time.

Mining companies in Zambia focus on excerpting copper and uranium, as well as gold, nickel and industrial deposits, which are more limited. For companies interested in mining operations, or the opening of mining companies, in Zambia, the Zambian Ministry of Mines, under which the Chamber of Mines is located, is the first port of call.
