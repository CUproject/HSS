## Coal Facts
Coal is a sedimentary rock that is formed from the remains of plants found mainly in underground deposits. This hard black rock is mostly made up of carbon and also contains sulfur, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. Coal forms from the accumulation of plant debris, mostly in a swamp environment. When a plant dies and falls into a swamp, the water of the swamp protects it from decaying.

Coal was very important to the Victorians because it was their main source of power. They used it for: driving machinery, moving locomotives and steamships, cooking and heating. The coal was dug out from deep mines underground. In the tunnels, the miners hacked at the coal with picks and shovels. Young children would work down in the mines

Mining. In Australia, nearly 80% of coal is produced from open-cut mines, in contrast to the rest of the world where open-cut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Open-cut mining is possible because coal seams are close to the surface. Such mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the resource.

Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines in Britain. Most coal was mined in the north and the north-east as well as the Midlands and some parts of Scotland. Due to the difficulties of moving coal many towns and industries were established around the large coal mines. How did coal production increase? 1700 : 2.7 million tonnes

Coal Mining People get coal by mining. In one process, called strip mining, miners take coal from just below the surface. In deep mining, miners dig long tunnels to get to coal that is buried far underground. Mining coal can be dangerous for the miners. Coal miners can be injured or killed when mine roofs collapse.
