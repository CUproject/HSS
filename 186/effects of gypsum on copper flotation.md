## Ultrasonic Effects on Precipitation and Froth Flotation
Ultrasonic Effects on Flotation. Ishak and Rowson (2009) showed that ultrasonic pre-treatment enhances the removal of heavy metals (namely, iron, zinc, and copper) from acid mine drainage when coupled with a flotation system. In the study, a Denver flotation cell was used.
