## WHAT IS A PRODUCTION LINE?
What is a Production Line? Many products are manufactured and assembled on a production line. Before the introduction of computer control and robots production lines were operated by people. Each person would carry out a limited number of tasks or even just one task and the product would then be passed down the production line to the next person.
