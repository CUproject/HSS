 · Abstract The pyrometallurgical refining of platinum-rhodium alloys from a contaminating copper impurity during induction remelting in the presence of oxygen is studied. Atomic emission analysis data for a platinum -rhodium alloy at each cycle of refining are presented. The results of atomic absorption, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray energy dispersive, X-ray.

The very earliest attempts at refining gold can be shown by the surface enhancement of gold rings. Gold quality was increased at the surface by 80-95% gold compared to 64-75% gold at the interior found in Nahal Qanah Cave dated to the 4th millennium BC.  Parting vessels used for refining gold with the cementation process have been found

## Everything about Gold Processing, Smelting, Refining, Cyanidation
Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## How the Gold Refining Process Works | Global Bullion
The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

of high-grade ore per year for 8 years. The deposit contains 0.12 ounces of gold per ton of high-grade ore and can be acquired at a cost of $10 per ton of ore (cost of mining ore at site). A sodium cyanide process is used to extract the gold from the ore, and various other processing techniques are used to produce 99.9% pure gold bullion from
