Abstract Acid mine drainage (AMD) is the largest environmental problem facing the world mining and processing industry because it has low pH and can contain high concentrations of potential pollutants. Biomass ash (BA) can be considered as a potential material for AMD treatment. The main goal of this work was to investigate potential use of Biomass ash of CPK-LA and PK-LA types for AMD

Acid mine drainage amd in the process of beneficiation. the coal is washed with water and chemicals asay to help it burn more efficiently 22. the resulting slurry, chockfull of chemicals and coal particles, is usually contained either by placing it into abandoned mines inrocess known as injection, where it supposedly is sealed.

## Acid Mine Drainage Treatment | Multotec
The active treatment of acid mine drainage is swiftly moving to treating the actual acid mine water directly through water treatment plants using lime or other neutralising materials. This reduces the acidity, which causes metals to precipitate out of the contaminated water. Multotec's treatment for AMD requires a single CIF® system, which
