## The Essential Power Tool List About Surface Grinder
The two basic components of a surface grinder are the grinding wheel and a reciprocating or rotary table. The working bed will also move in and out, which allows a complete and even grinding of the workpiece. Most surface grinders have the precision to ±0.002mm. However, as you can imagine, this is a highly time-intensive process.
