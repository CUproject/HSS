## Limestone Slabs / Ledge Stone | House of Rocks
Raw limestone slabs require little to no maintenance and make for an excellent option for retaining walls, sea walls, water features, and natural seating. Size and overall thickness of limestone slabs vary by type, but most pieces are 3-7' long and 12-30" wide with a weight range of pounds each.

## How to Make Automotive Paint Shops More Sustainable
Material efficiency:  The overspray is thereby bound with powdered limestone. The advantage is that there is no paint sludge as in conventional wet scrubbing.  In other words, the repeated use of the powdered limestone reduces consumption and thus also the cost. Through the use of this technology, which allows for recirculated air in the

## Cost Of Limestone Material
The Costs Minimum cost of base material: $2 per sq ft Maximum cost of base material: $11 per sq ft Although limestone is available in a wide range of sizes, it is most commonly found in tiles sized from 12x12 inches to 18x18 inches However large slabs and small mosaics can also be used when installing limestone flooring
