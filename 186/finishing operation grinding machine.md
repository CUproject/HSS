## What is the honing process and define what each operation and machine 
First, it is a stock removal process which takes out ruptured metal and reaches base metal. Second, a finish pattern is generated to provide the best possible surface for promoting optimum lubricating conditions. Third, honing assures extremely accurate straightness, roundness and size of the cylindrical surface.

## Using Grinding Versus EDM to Finish Form Tools
Speed is one distinctive advantage. Unless there is a high amount of material removal necessary, grinding is a faster machining process than EDM. On the other hand, if there is a large amount of material to be removed to achieve the desired shape, using EDM to machine the part before the grinding process is more efficient.

Grinding machine operates at high speed similarly other machine tools but the difference in the operation. The grinding machine used for finishing only after the machining done by some other machine tools. We can say that the function of the grinding machine comes into play after the machining of a work piece by turning or milling machines.

## How to Use a Surface Grinder Machine - American Machine Tools
A surface grinding machine is used to produce a smooth accurate finish on either metallic or nonmetallic materials. It uses a round rotating abrasive grinding wheel that remains stationary (but rotating) while the feed table (with work attached) is run in a reciprocating motion (left and right) under the grinding wheel.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.
