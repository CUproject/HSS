## East Hampton Main Beach - Yelp
When we arrived at the beach, we took off our flip flops and walked on the sand. Instead of sitting on the beach, we decided to take a walk along the shoreline and collect rocks and seashells. The beach was much cleaner than the ones I have been to. The sand was hot but soft to walk on. The water was warm and salty. The air was fresh and crispy.

## Can you clean, disinfect, sanitize or vacuum kinetic sand 
Nov 14, 2020Kinetic Sand is a very commendable mess-free, moldable, toxic-free, and easy to clean up sand. It could be addicting for kids to play with and also for adults as a stress-relieving sensory toy to flex those muscles and take those tension away! It contains 98% sand and 2% polymer, thus making it shapeable, moldable, and reusable.
