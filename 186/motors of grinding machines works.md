## How do milling machines work
Mar 4, 2021The science behind how milling machines work is similar to how a drill works. As a drill is pressed down on a workpiece, the material being hit by the cutter is removed from the workpiece from a both a vertical direction and angle. Instead, with milling the "drill" in this instance keeps the same angle but moves sideways.
