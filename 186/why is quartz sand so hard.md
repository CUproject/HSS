## Why Are Squats So Hard? (10 Squat Exercises & Ways To Fix 
Jun 8, 2021Reason #1: Lack of Back Strength. Back strength, particularly your upper back strength is in high demand during back squats. Your shoulders need to be constantly pinched back and down and held there to stabilize the barbell on them. Having a weak upper back means you may slouch during a set of back squats.

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

[00:19:03] Quartz grains survive much better because they're so hard. So that's why there's so much quartz sand around. So quartz sand is the stuff that we really, that we need, that we use the most of. And then the main differentiation when it comes to how we use it is the level of purity, how much the purity of the quartz in that sense.
