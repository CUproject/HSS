Beneficiation is a physical process that separates the matrix into its components—roughly one part phosphate rock, one part clay, and one part sand. The materials start out highly aggregated and begin breaking apart while being pumped through the pipelines to the plant. The beneficiation plant may be located as far away as 8 miles from the mine.

Commercial fertilizer it is mostly soluble P (in the form of phosphate). Within 24 hours this soluble P starts being converted to labile P and eventually to stable P. What this means is that most of the phosphorus fertilizer you add to the soil is available to plants for a short period of time, and then it gets locked away in the soil.
