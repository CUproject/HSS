## Mining and biodiversity: key issues and research needs in  - PubMed
Mining poses serious and highly specific threats to biodiversity. However, mining can also be a means for financing alternative livelihood paths that, over the long-term, may prevent biodiversity loss. Complex and controversial issues associated with mining and biodiversity conservation are often si .

## Why should biodiversity matter to mining companies?
These commitments will help extractive companies to maximise opportunities to make a positive contribution to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This is fundamental to the long-term health of the business and the wider society in which it operates. FFI has partnered with companies in the extractive sector for over 15 years.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.
