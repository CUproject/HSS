## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

Mineral beneficiation is the process of concentration, and was first described in Agricola's famous treatise, De Re Metallica, published in 1556. The earliest ores to be discovered and processed were of such high grade that they did not require beneficiation, and they satisfied mankind's needs for nearly 3,000 years.
