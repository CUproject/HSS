## Properties of bricks made using fly ash, quarry dust and billet scale 
Abstract. This paper reports the findings of an investigation done on bricks made using fly ash (FA), quarry dust (QD), and billet scale (BS) by non conventional method. The procedure for producing the bricks includes mixing the constituents along with cement and water, and then forming the bricks within moulds without applying pressure over them.

The demand for sand in making sand-cement bricks as an infilled material for wall construction are increasing, thus alternative material in replacing the use of sand is indeed deem important to be looked into, and if possible should be lightweight. With that in mind, a research was conducted by utilising quarry dust (QD), rice husk (RH) and kenaf powder (KP), which can be considered as waste
