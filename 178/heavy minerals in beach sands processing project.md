##  "Mineral Sands Deposits: their complexity and need for  - CRIRSCO
The term "Mineral Sands" refers to sands which contain suites of minerals with high specific gravity (> 4 Specific Gravity) known as heavy minerals. Heavy minerals occurs as disseminated, associated or concentrated deposits within the sands. Found in an alluvial (old beach or river system) environment.

## Mineral sands - Earth Resources
Sep 1, 2022Mineral sands deposits typically comprise the following minerals of economic interest: Zircon is rich in the element zirconium. Rutile, leucoxene and ilmenite contain titanium. Trace amounts of monazite and xenotime contain rare earth elements. Other minerals such as magnetite and garnet may also be present in mineral sands.

## Heavy mineral sands ore deposits
Heavy mineral sands are a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium, titanium, thorium, tungsten, rare-earth elements, the industrial minerals diamond, sapphire, garnet, and occasionally precious metals or gemstones.. Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.

Individual bodies of heavy mineral-rich sands are typically about 1 kilometer wide and more than 5 kilometers long. Many heavy-mineral sands districts extend for more than 10 kilometers and contain several individual deposits that are spread along an ancient or modern strandline. Reported thicknesses of economic deposits range from 3 to 45 meters.
