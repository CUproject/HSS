## The Cement Industry in Europe and the Middle East
While continuing to expand, the cement industry has also been proactive in meeting environmental challenges, through investment in energy-saving technologies, alternative fuels and recycled raw materials. The use of waste products as fuel in European cement plants is already saving the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of coal per year.

## coal - Coal types | Britannica
Coal types Macerals. Coals contain both organic and inorganic phases. The latter consist either of minerals such as quartz and clays that may have been brought in by flowing water (or wind activity) or of minerals such as pyrite and marcasite that formed in place (authigenic). Some formed in living plant tissues, and others formed later during peat formation or coalification.

## Coal for cement: Present and future trends - Global Cement
Coal for cement: Present and future trends. 01 March 2016. Coal provides around 90% of the energy consumed by cement plants around the world, despite the environmental harm caused by its combustion. It takes 200 - 450kg of coal to produce 1t of cement. The cement industry consumes around 4% of global coal production, around 330Mt/yr.
