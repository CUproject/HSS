Primary lead is mined, separated from ore, and refined into various products, whereas secondary lead is recovered from used objects, such as used lead-acid batteries, for reuse in other products. Smelting is a key process in lead product production, and involves heating lead ore or recovered lead with chemical reducing agents. Both primary and

## tin processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The principle of tin smelting is the chemical reduction of tin oxide by heating with carbon to produce tin metal and carbon dioxide gas. In practice, the furnace feed contains the tin oxide concentrate, carbon in the form of anthracite coal or coke, and limestone to act as a flux and a slag-producing agent. In a typical reverberatory process

## Pilot study on the effect of secondary copper smelters on 
The secondary copper smelters were located in regions with no other PCN emission sources, such as waste incinerators, iron and steel smelters or coking facilities. Another 26 samples were collected at a distance of 20-30 km from the secondary copper smelters and used as control samples.
