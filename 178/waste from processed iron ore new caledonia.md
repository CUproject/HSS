Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate. In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues. Based on the

## Iron Ore Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being
