## Mineral (nutrient)
Mineral (nutrient) In the context of nutrition, a mineral is a chemical element required as an essential nutrient by organisms to perform functions necessary for life.

A comparatively rare mineral found in metamorphic rocks and often with kyanite. Pyroxenes Pyroxenes refers to a group of closely related and dark coloured rock forming minerals. Ex: augite, diopside. Pyrrhotite Pyrrhotite has the formula FeS and a relative hardness of 5. It is a magnetic common mineral often found in igneous rocks. It is mined

## Igneous rock - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic rock.. Igneous rocks are rocks formed from molten magma.The material is made liquid by the heat inside the Earth's mantle.. When magma comes out onto the surface of the Earth, it is called lava.Lava cools down to form rocks such as tuff and basalt. Intrusive rocks are made when the magma slowly cools

## Rock (geology) - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A rock is a naturally occurring solid. Rocks are made of collections of mineral grains that are held together in a firm, solid mass. They are made of minerals (which are crystalline), or other mineral-like substances.. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock.That means the Earth's crust is made of rock. The different minerals in the rocks make different kinds of rock.

Rocks are composed primarily of grains of minerals, which are crystalline solids formed from atoms chemically bonded into an orderly structure.: 3 Some rocks also contain mineraloids, which are rigid, mineral-like substances, such as volcanic glass,: 55, 79 that lacks crystalline structure. The types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which it was formed.

Minerals form in many ways. The mineral halite, which is used as table salt, forms when water evaporates in a hot, shallow part of the ocean, leaving behind the salt it contained. Many types of minerals are made when molten rock, or magma cools and turns into a solid. Talc, a mineral that can be used to make baby powder, forms deep in Earth as high pressure and temperature causes changes in

Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years.

Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.

Talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2) is the softest known mineral and can be scratched with a fingernail. Upon contact, talc has a distinctive greasy feel and a waxy/pearly luster. Talc is a foliated mineral and associated with metamorphic rocks. It is an alteration product from the metamorphism of minerals such as serpentine, pyroxene and amphibole.

Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

## Rock magnetism
Rock magnetism is the study of the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments and soils.The field arose out of the need in paleomagnetism to understand how rocks record the Earth's magnetic field. This remanence is carried by minerals, particularly certain strongly magnetic minerals like magnetite (the main source of magnetism in lodestone).An understanding of remanence helps paleomagnetists to

## Origins of minerals - The Gemology Project
By the cooling down of magma, atoms are linked into crystalline patterns and subsequently different minerals are formed. When the formation takes place in the depths of the earth's crust (approx. 33km deep) quite large rocks may be formed (for instance, granites). Igneous rocks are formed and created by magmatic processes in the earth.

A rock is a natural mass of minerals found within the earth's crust while minerals are substances that have a definite chemical composition and occur freely in nature. Rocks can be are classified in three types on the basis of their texture and the process of formation i.e. igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.

Rocks are made up of minerals. A mineral is naturally occurring and inorganic, and has a distinct chemical formula and crystal structure. When minerals form in open spaces, their crystal form is apparent (Fig. 1A). However, most minerals occur in an interlocking network with other minerals to form different kinds of rocks (Fig. 1B).

## Mineral
A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as limestone or quartzite, are composed primarily of one mineral - calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone, and quartz in the latter case. Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar.

## Silicate
In chemistry, a silicate is any member of a family of polyatomic anions consisting of silicon and oxygen, usually with the general formula [SiO (4-2x)− 4−x] n, where 0 ≤ x < 2.The family includes orthosilicate SiO 4− 4 (x = 0), metasilicate SiO 2− 3 (x = 1), and pyrosilicate Si 2 O 6− 7 (x = 0.5, n = 2).The name is also used for any salt of such anions, such as sodium metasilicate
