The more compact grained and heavier a stone the harder it is. Due to alternate wetting and drying the resulting crushing strength can be reduced even up to 30-40%. Being dry stones allow more crushing strength than when wet. It is the ability of a stone to endure and maintain its essential and distinctive characteristics i.e. resistance to decay, strength and

Another simple technique for determining moisture in stone is to take a piece of plastic about 12 inches square and place it on the suspected stone. Tape all four edges and allow it to stay overnight or 12 hours. After 12 hours, if there is any moisture present, you will see condensation collecting under the plastic.
