## Roll Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A distinct class of roll crushers is referred to as 'sizers.' These are more heavily constructed units with slower rotation, and direct drive of the rolls rather than belt drives. They have a lower profile, allowing material to be easily fed by loaders, and are a good choice for portable crushers at the mine that reduce the coal in size for conveying to the preparation plant.
