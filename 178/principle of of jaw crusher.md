## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws. The moving jaw moves back and forward against the fixed jaw, and material fed from the top of the machine is compressed

## Methods to improve productivity of Jaw crusher
The jaw crusher is often used as coarse crushing equipment, and the size of the discharge port should be based on the optimal feed particle size of the two-stage crushing. The adjustment of the phagocytic angle (the angle between the movable jaw plate and the fixed jaw plate) needs to be strictly carried out, generally within the range of 17

Jaw-crusher Construction. Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines and hence must be robustly constructed. The main frame is often made from cast iron or steel, connected with tie-bolts. It is commonly made in sections so that it can be transported underground for installation. Modern jaw crushers may have a main frame of welded mild steel plate.

## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.

## Jaw Crushers - high quality and reliability from RETSCH
The crushing ratio of a jaw crusher results from the maximum achievable final fineness in relation to the maximum feed size. For Retsch jaw crushers, this lies between 12.5 and 220. A high value reflects the capacity of a jaw crusher to accept large sample pieces and provide powerful crushing performance, resulting in high final fineness.

The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.
