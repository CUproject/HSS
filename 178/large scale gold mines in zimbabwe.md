## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Introduction. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) involves gold mining through basic rudimentary and semi-mechanized methods [].ASGM is usually associated with poor health and safety standards [].In 2017, an estimated 14-19 million miners were employed in ASGM globally [].In Zimbabwe, over 500,000 people are involved in artisanal and small-scale mining, which is largely ASGM [].
