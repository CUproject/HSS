Advantages of PCI. PCI uses non coking coal. This coal is cheaper than the metallurgical coke. In most of the blast furnaces PCI replaces 30 to 50% of the metallurgical coke charge. This results in lower fuel cost. The productivity of blast furnace improves since coal injection is accompanied with oxygen injection. Injection rates are higher

## What You Should Know About Metallurgical Coal - ThoughtCo
Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used to produce coke, the primary source of carbon used in steelmaking. Coal is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock formed over millions of years as plants and other organic materials are buried and subjected to geological forces.

14. ADVANTAGES OF PCI :- 1. PCI uses non coking coal. This coal is cheaper than the metallurgical coke. In most of the blast furnaces PCI replaces 30 to 50 % of the metallurgical coke charge. This results in lower fuel cost 2. The productivity of blast furnace improves since coal injection is accompanied with oxygen injection. 3.

## Pulverized Coal Injection - Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) is a process that involves blowing large volumes of fine coal granules into the BF. This provides a supplemental carbon source to speed up the production of metallic iron, reducing the need for coke production. As a result energy use and emissions can be reduced. However, as coke provides physical support and gas permeability in the BF, its complete

## pulverised coal advantages vs lump coal Aug
Search - Mini Mill Coal Injection · Pulverised Coal Injection (PCI) technology involves injecting coal directly into the blast furnace to provide the carbon for ironmaking - displacing some of the coke required for the process. A wider range of coals can be used in PCI, including steam coal which has a lower carbon content than coking coal.
