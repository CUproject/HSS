## Upstream Sector in Poland - past, present and future | Info Shale 
New capital projects may not materialize. It may well appear than the "shale bloom" had only lasted for a short while. Poland's upstream sector has a long history that began with the onset of crude oil production in the world. Today, however, conventional resources are scarce, while unconventional ones are still to be appraised in Poland.

## Fracking in Poland - Clintel
Mar 1, 2022Poland probably has between 350 to 5,300 billion cubic meters of potentially recoverable natural gas, the large range of estimates is due to the lack of good geological data, which in turn is due to the lack of drilling and testing. Poland's consumption of natural gas was about 21 billion cubic meters in 2020 to put these numbers into

## Poland Shale - News, Companies, Geology, Maps, Operators
Relatively new on the unconventional scene, the shale craze in Poland was initially spurred by the country's efforts to lessen its dependence on Russian energy resources. As a result, the country has become one of the most popular shale targets in Europe. Though it is largely untapped, the area has yet to spur accelerated development of potential resources.

Bioleaching is an economical and cost-effective methodology, which has been widely used for the extraction of precious metals from mineral ores. Furthermore, it is an eco-friendly process when compared to conventional chemical leaching processes. The black shale ores contain base (e.g. copper and nickel), precious (principally silver) and PGM (platinum group metals) metals, but also high

Samples of black shale were collected from Lubin underground copper mine (Lubin-Głogów Copper District, Poland) at a depth of 600 m from a stratum containing veins of black shale. Crushed shale fractions with fragment diameters in the ranges 0-0.5, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-3.0 and 3.0-5.0 mm were used in experiments.

The copper ore of a copper mine in Zimbabwe is mainly copper-bearing pyrrhotite and high-copper skarn ore. The copper grade of the original ore is 1.25%, and its iron grade is 30.73%. The copper minerals in the ore are mainly chalcopyrite, followed by porphyry, and a small amount of chalcocite, covellite, malachite, etc.

Any of these will be a good choice for basic welding tasks, but I recommend getting a batch of ER70S-2 and others only if needed.  Whether welding stainless sheet metal or doing some basic mild steel >welding</b>, you need proper tungsten electrodes and filler.
