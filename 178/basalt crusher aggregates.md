## Engineering properties of basalt aggregates in terms of use in granular 
When basalt aggregates are used as crushed-stone, the flakiness rate is found relatively high due to their glassy structure. On the other hand, basalt aggregates were found to have fairly high impact resistance (6.1 - 10.7). The high impact resistance of aggregates eliminates the tendency of flaky grains to degradation.

## Application of Basalt and it's Products in Civil Engineering
Crushed form of basalt is used as aggregates. Basaltic aggregates are dense and fine-grained rocks that are black or very dark color green and are formed when molten lava from earths crust rises up and solidifies. Crushed and graded aggregate, essentially free of moisture. Basalt aggregates are similar to limestone aggregates in many aspects.
