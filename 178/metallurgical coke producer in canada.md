##  12.2 Coke Production - US EPA
The primary purpose of modern coke ovens is the production of quality coke for the iron and steel industry. The recovery of coal chemicals is an economical necessity, as they equal approximately 35 percent of the value of the coal. To produce quality metallurgical coke, a high-temperature carbonization process is used.
