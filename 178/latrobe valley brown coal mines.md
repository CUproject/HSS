## COAL TO HYDROGEN | Friends of Latrobe Water
Under a commercialisation arrangement for coal to hydrogen, a new coal pit would need to be established with only two options available within the Latrobe Valley area. These are either south of the existing Hazelwood mine void at the site known as the Gifford site or further east of the LoyYang coal pit in the farming area of Flynn.

## New authority and strategy for Latrobe Valley mine rehabilitation
The rehabilitation of the Latrobe Valley's brown coal mines will be steered by experts and locals through the creation of a new authority and a strategy to guide rehabilitation planning and works over the coming decades.  The authority replaces the Latrobe Valley Mine Rehabilitation Commissioner from 30 June. The Commissioner, Emeritus

## Coal mining in the Latrobe Valley - Australian Geomechanics
The power stations of the Latrobe Valley play a critical role in the generation of over 80% of power supplied to Victoria. These power stations rely on extensive deposits of brown coal which underlie the region. Coal mining at Hazelwood ceased in March 2017, the Mine is now in the closure phase.

## latrobe valley brown coal mines
The Loy Yang and Yallourn mines produce the majority of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley. While the majority of coal in the Latrobe Valley is brown coal, an estimated 6.8 million tonnes of black or bituminous coal is located in western Gippsland. These deposits are high volatile black coal with medium ash and moisture content. GET PRICE >>

Disruptions to black coal supplies for Melbourne in the 1880s prompted the first mining of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley. Several companies were formed, the most prominent being the Great Morwell Coal Mining Company, at present Yallourn North, which mined lignite from an open cut and manufactured briquettes for a while.

## Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia: A world class brown coal deposit 
The Latrobe Valley brown coalfields are situated some 150 km east of Melbourne in the State of Victoria, Australia. The brown coals of the Latrobe Valley were deposited within the Gippsland Basin of Victoria, Australia, during the Eocene to Late Miocene. The coal forms part of a sequence of essentially non-marine sands, clays and coals

## Latrobe Valley's Efforts Improve Mine Safety, Add Valuable Jobs
According to the Environment Victoria report, "Faster rehabilitation of Latrobe Valley coal mines could employ hundreds of people for 20 years, generate more than $420 million of direct spending, and slash the risk of fires.". As mine safety improves, so too can local economies. Gavin Lind, of the Victorian Division of the Minerals Council

## Drilling Techniques for Investigation and Operation of Large  - AusIMM
The development and operation of three large open cut brown coal mines in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia, requires a wide range of drilling techniques for coal resource evaluation and stratigraphic defi- nition, material property identification, open cut dewatering, and instal- lation of groundwater monitoring bores. This paper describes in detail the range of drilling techniques

N2 - Victoria, Australia contains 25% of the world's known brown coal reserves. Much of the coal is located in thick seams overlain by a thin veneer of sands and clays. Three brown coal open-cut mines are presently operating in the Latrobe Valley. As a result of the mining activity, ground movements can be significant within and around the mines.

The Coalition government and ALP continue to refuse to rule out a new allocation of brown coal reserves for new mines in the Latrobe Valley. The Coalition holds the view that Victoria could even have a brown coal export industry. The environmental, climate and public health costs of new coal mines will be enormous. It is time to rule out new coal.

## Review of the historical data characterizing Latrobe Valley brown coal 
Victoria, Australia contains 25% of the world's known brown coal reserves. Much of the coal is located in thick seams overlain by a thin veneer of sands and clays. Three brown coal open-cut mines are presently operating in the Latrobe Valley. As a result of the mining activity, ground movements can be significant within and around the mines.
