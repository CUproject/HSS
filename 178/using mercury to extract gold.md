Step 1: Crushing the ore. There is gold somewhere in the piles of ore laid out here on the ground. The first step towards finding that gold is to crush the ore. The ore is placed in a ball mill (like the one below) - a barrel-like machine filled with metal balls - and rotated until the ore is crushed into a fine powder.

## Extracting And Purifying Mercury
The cost of extracting and purifying metals is quite varied for several reasons. If the ore is plentiful it is cheaper e.g. iron ore but silver ores and gold are much rarer and on that basis alone they would be a more valuable commodity. Reduction of ores using coke e.g. iron made from cheap coal is cheaper than the electricity bill for

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining - Earthworks
Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process. The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity. With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand. Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust. Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.

Use and Loss of Mercury in Gold Mining . To enhance gold recovery from hydraulic mining, hundreds of pounds of liquid mercury (several 76-lb flasks) were added to riffles and troughs in a typical sluice. The high density of mercury allowed gold and gold-mercury amalgam to sink while sand and gravel passed over the mercury and through the sluice.
