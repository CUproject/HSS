## Calculating Cubic Yards vs. Tons
A cubic yard is a measurement by volume (Or most simply put, a measurement by size) 2. A ton is a measurement by weight. 3. A "/" sign means 'per,' so 1.5 TONS/CY reads 1.5 TONS per Cubic yard which simply means there are 1.5 tons per (for) every cubic yard of material. Fortunately, a cubic yard of material has a conversion factor (unit
