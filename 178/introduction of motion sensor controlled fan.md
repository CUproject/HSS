## Lm_sensor's fancontrol - Gentoo Wiki
Introduction. Fancontrol is a generic fan control script provided by package sys-apps/lm-sensors which can run as a system daemon. First install lm-sensors as described in lm_sensors. Make sure that any Super I/O chip is enabled in the kernel, and its module loaded.

## Could I use this motion sensor to trigger an extractor fan?
19 Jan 2019. #2. Ian H said: Could I use one of these to trigger it. If you mean that the sensor triggers a timer in the fan then the answer is almost certainly NO. If you mean the timer in the sensor controls how long the fan runs after movement stops then it might work. It depends on whether the sensor can operate into an inductive load.

The sensor outputs a 5V signal for a period of one minute as soon as it detects the presence of a person. It offers a tentative range of detection of about 6-7 m and is highly sensitive. When the PIR motion sensor detects a person, it outputs a 5V signal to the Arduino. Thus, an interrupt on Arduino is triggered.

## Automatic Temperature Controlled Fan using Arduino - Circuit Digest
Arduino Code for temperature-controlled fan. First, we include the library for LCD and DHT sensor and then define pin for lcd, dht sensor and for fan. Then initialize all the things in setup loop. And in loop by using dht function reads DHT sensor and then using some dht functions we extract temperature and display these on LCD.

## An Introduction to Motion Sensors: PIR, Tilt, Force, and More
The PIR, or passive infrared, detector is commonly used in intruder alarm systems. A PIR is similar to a thermal sensor. These infrared sensors/detectors are the secret sauce inside motion sensor security lights that illuminate driveways when someone approaches. Infrared is outside our eyes' light-detecting abilities (see Figure 1 below).
