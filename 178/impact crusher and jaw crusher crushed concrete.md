## Tips on Choosing a Concrete Crusher for Demolition Contractors
While jaw crushers use pressure to break up concrete, impact crushers rely on impact (as their name implies). Some impact crushers throw the rock against hard surfaces with such velocity that the rocks naturally break along internal fissures. Other impact crushers use hammers on the outer edge of a spinning rotor to break up materials

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.
