## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
The Brockman Iron Formation in this province is the most significant host for high-grade hematite iron ore deposits.  The latter property aids in the beneficiation of magnetite ores. Magnetite contains 72.4% Fe by molecular weight, which is higher than hematite, but magnetite ores having lower ore grade (generally 20-30% Fe) owing to the
