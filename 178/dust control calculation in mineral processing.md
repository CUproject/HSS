## Mineral Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ashish Rajoria, in Innovative Exploration Methods for Minerals, Oil, Gas, and Groundwater for Sustainable Development, 2022. Abstract. Mineral processing operations present many challenges to process control due to variations in unmeasured ore properties, material transport delays, and nonlinear response characteristics. The conventional control approach relies mainly on the proportional

## Dust control agent | Solvay
Unpaved mine ramp and haul roads produce excessive dust, causing many health and safety hazards for employees and residents. Solvay AEROSPRAY® dust control agent binders are dust control agents and polymeric soil stabilizers. These products serve as suppressants of nuisance dust generated during the transport of dry material created from dry, windy conditions.
