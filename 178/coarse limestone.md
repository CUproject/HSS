Limestone is sedimentary rock, so it must have formed at the Earth's surface. It starts off as sediment, and it must have more than 50% calcium carbonate in it to qualify as limestone. Rock such as mudstone or sandstone - where the grains have come down rivers and been delivered to the sea - they can have a highish calcium carbonate

May 11, 2021Blue Planet's biomimetic carbon capture process creates a limestone rock substitute that can replace natural limestone rock mined from quarries (the principal ingredient in concrete). By utilizing a carbon mineralization process - similar to natural ooid formation - Blue Planet produces coarse and fine aggregate material from sequestered

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
