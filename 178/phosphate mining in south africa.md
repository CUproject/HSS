As the present world consumption of rock phosphate is approximately 90 million tons per annum there are enough deposits for several millenniums. At present approximately 1.5 million tons per annum are used in South Africa while the mining of rock phosphate for domestic use as well as for export is between 2.9 and 315 million tons per annum.
