## Concrete Technology - Cement
Concrete Technology. In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates (rocks). The paste, composed essentially of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a series of chemical reactions called hydration, the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like

ADMIXTURES. Admixtures are the other primary ingredient of modern concrete and the most important is air-entraining admixture. Any concrete that will be exposed to freeze-thaw and deicing salts must have entrained air to prevent spalling of the surface and even complete breakdown of the concrete. In severe exposure areas, the air content should vary from 7.5% for 3/8 inch maximum sized
