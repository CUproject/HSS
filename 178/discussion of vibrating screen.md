## Common Faults and Solutions of Vibrating Screen
1. Abnormal sound of vibrating screen. The exciter bearing is damaged. If the bearing is damaged, it will make a lot of noise. At this time, it is necessary to stop the machine and replace the vibration exciter bearing. The fastening bolts are loose. If the fastening bolts for fixing the vibrating screen are loose, it will cause abnormal noise

## Exciter Mechanisms & Vibration Types - MEKA
Material speed is high in linearly vibrating screens due to the linear vibration motion. The linear vibration drives the material forward over the screening media or feeder tray, facilitating fast-feed rate velocities. The single direction of vibration, however, may lead to the plunging and blinding of the screen media.

## The advantages and disadvantages of vibrating screen sieve | Haiside
Jan 4, 2022Disadvantages: high noise, easy to run rough, not easy to disassemble, and poor surface abrasion resistance and anti-smashing performance during work. Selection principle: dehydration, de-intermediation and de-sliming of various linear vibrating screens and slime curved screens. 5. Bar sieve plate.
