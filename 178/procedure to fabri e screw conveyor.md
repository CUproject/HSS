## Screw Conveyor vs Screw Feeder - Wrights Dowson Group
May 18, 2021The Key Differences: Screw feeders are normally placed at the beginning of a process, whereas screw conveyors move product from A to B anywhere it is required. Screw feeders are designed to meter product, whereas Screw conveyors are designed to move it. Screw conveyors can be used to mix, heat or cool product. The screw feeder doesn't do this.
