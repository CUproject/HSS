## Textiles Wastes and Recycling Options
The raw materials (Textile & plastic wastes) are already dyed. As a result, zero dye, zero chemical & almost zero water is needed for the recycling process. It is saving dyeing, chemical & water cost. The manufacturing process of "Textiles from Wastes" is comparetively an easy and quick process than the manufacturing process of virgin textiles.
