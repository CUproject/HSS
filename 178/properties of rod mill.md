## Rod mills, how they function - Mine Engineer.Com
The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (-4 to -35 mesh).

## The advantages of composite mill liners - The Weir Group
Advantage #1 - Composite liners are lightweight. It is well known that when the mill isn't turning, the mine isn't earning, so it's essential that operators can predict and plan for maintenance schedules. During this downtime the relining must be completed as quickly as possible and, with significant human involvement, it is a high-risk

## Rod Mills - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Rod Mills may be considered either fine crushers or coarse grinding equipment. They are capable of taking as large as 2″ feed and making a product as fine as 35-48 mesh. Of particular advantage is their adaptability to handling wet sticky ores, which normally would cause difficulty in crushing operations.
