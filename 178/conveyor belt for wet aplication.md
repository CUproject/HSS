Answer. Shaftless screw conveyors are the perfect solution and designed to efficiently convey semi-fluid and sticky bulk materials.

## Bulk material handling systems - all you need to know
The belt conveyor's role in bulk material handling systems. Designed for continuous operation, a belt conveyor can be used in a wide range of capacities and distances, and its length can be a few meters or tens of kilometers. At either end of the conveyor, the belt wraps around a pulley. This is the most common belt conveyor design.

The reinforcement usually found on the inside of a conveyor belt is normally referred to as the "carcass.". In a sense, the carcass is the conveyor belt since it must: a) Provide the tensile strength necessary to move the loaded belt. b) Absorb the impact of the impinging material being loaded onto the conveyor belt.
