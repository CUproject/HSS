A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher. The granularity of the materials that are crushed in the cone crushers is about 35mm to 350 mm.

## Jaw Crusher VS Cone Crusher | Which Is The Better Crusher
The gyratory body of cone crusher is higher, twice or three times of jaw crusher, and the workshop cost is larger. The weight of cone crusher is larger than that of jaw crusher with the same output by 1-2 times, so the equipment cost is higher. The installation and maintenance of cone crusher is more complicated than jaw crusher.
