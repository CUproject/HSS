## The cement industry at a turning point: A path toward value creation
In the cement industry, however, this link is weak. The industry's record of value creation is spotty, with ROIC levels roughly equal to the cost of capital, at around 9 percent. Behind the lackluster ROIC, two drivers stand out: high goodwill (seen in the low tangible capital ratio) and inadequate capital efficiency. Call it bad timing.

The consumption of cement per cubic meter of brickwork is determined by the composition of the mixture. Standard cement mixing for joining building blocks involves the simultaneous use of sand and water. It is extremely rare to vary the proportions of the components, mainly the result achieved depends on the brand of the used binder.
