## What You Need To Know About Drilling and Blasting
Aug 18, 2021What is drilling and blasting? This is a process followed to break rock for excavation purposes, via controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics. Drilling and blasting is practiced most often in mining, quarrying, and civil engineering projects. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock-cut.

## Drill and Blast | Mining Methods | American Mine Services
The drill and blast mining, as its name would suggest, is a method of mining that begins with drilling holes into rock after careful surveying and developing a plan. Next, these holes are carefully loaded with explosives. The explosives are then detonated, causing the rock to fracture and crumble. From there, it is simply a matter of removing
