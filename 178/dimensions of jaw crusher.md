## Jaw Crushers - Powerscreen
Jaw crushers are typically used as primary crushers because they can take large and variable sized feed material, so the original feed won't have to be blasted down to a fine size. Powerscreen jaws are designed to be significantly more reliable and have lower wear rates, maximizing production and minimizing wear parts.
