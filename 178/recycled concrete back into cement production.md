Recycled concrete and masonry (RCM) aggregate can be described as graded aggregate produced from sorted and clean waste concrete and masonry. The RCM material may contain brick, gravel crush rock or other forms of stony materials as blended materials. Class 1B-RCA as per HB 155 (2002) is an RCM aggregate.

## Building from old buildings: demolition waste is being turned into new 
Mar 9, 2021Concrete is made from granular materials such as sand and crushed stone - known as aggregates - bound together by a cement paste. Cement has a high carbon footprint due to the chemistry of its production and the high processing temperatures, while the aggregates have a high 'resources footprint' because they come from finite natural sources.

Production of this novel concrete requires about 36% less energy and emits up to 76% less carbon dioxide as compared to conventional bendable concrete made of cement. Our laboratory test results showed that this novel concrete is about 400 times more bendable than normal concrete, yet has similar strength. Credit: Swinburne University.

Another issue is that the production of cement from primary materials (limestone) is responsible for about 10% of the world's CO 2 emissions. High-grade recycling of EOL concrete liberates the old cement paste from the concrete which can then be recycled into new cement with lower CO 2 emissions. End-of-Life concrete with steel rebars.

The modern use of ash is as an additive to cement, more than a replacement for it.

-The recycled aggregate generated from washing and decomposing of the residual concrete at the washing tank can be used again at a certain extent in concrete production.-Recycled water-cement mixture can be re-used for concrete production by using agitator which prevents the cement particles from sinking into the water.

## recycled concrete back into cement production,newmont exploration
A Review of The Use Of Recycled Materials in Rigid The majority of CKD is recycled back into the cement kiln as raw feed In addition, new technology has allowed the use of previously landfilled CKD to be use as raw feed stock Recycling this byproduct back into the kiln not only reduces the amount of CKD to be managed outside the kiln, it also reduces the need for
