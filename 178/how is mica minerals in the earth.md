The luster of the micas is usually described as splendent, but some cleavage faces appear pearly. Mohs hardness of the micas is approximately 2 1/2 on cleavage flakes and 4 across cleavage. Specific gravity for the micas varies with composition. The overall range is from 2.76 for muscovite to 3.2 for iron-rich biotite.
