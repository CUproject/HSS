Since sound level meters provide a measure of sound intensity at only one point in time, it is generally necessary to take a number of measurements at different times during the day to estimate noise exposure over a workday. If noise levels fluctuate, the amount of time noise remains at each of the various measured levels must be determined.

## Noise - WorkSafeBC
Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most prevalent occupational health problems. It is permanent and irreversible. Work-related hearing loss can be caused by a single event such as an explosion. More often, it is caused by long-term exposure to excessive noise, like machine noise, that is present throughout a work shift.

## Noise Pollution and Its Control in Mining
Noise known as a major health hazard is spot specific in case of underground mining where the operators are exposed to continuous background noise while high level short duration noise peaks are common in case of surface mining. The human ear is most sensitive in 2 to 5 KHz range and less sensitive in high and low frequencies.
