CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl, but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary, tertiary and quaternary stages.

The XL2000 cone crusher is intended for secondary or tertiary applications and does not replace the need for a primary gyratory or jaw crusher. However, the XL2000 can replace a SAG mill, according to the company, thereby reducing overall costs while still maintaining circuit capacity and producing a product crushed to specific requirements.

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.
