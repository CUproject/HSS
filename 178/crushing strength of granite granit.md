## Crushing Test or Compression strength Test on stone - Expert Civil
The Crushing strength or compressive strength is given by the formula as: C= P/A. Where, C = compressive strength. P = Load at failure. A = cross-sectional area of bearing face of the specimen. Then the average value of the six specimens is calculated and the result is recorded for that stone sample. You may also like.

## Stone Crushing - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Oct 20, 2020The crushing-strength test is not practiced as a rule except on stone intended for building purposes. The fact is that most rocks have adequate compressive resistance for structural purposes. Crushed stone does not lend itself to the compression test very readily unless the sample is taken from the ledge rock before it is crushed.
