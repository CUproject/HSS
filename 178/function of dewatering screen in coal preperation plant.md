Ultrafine Coal Cleaning Recent studies have found that spirals such as the SX7 can provide an effective gravity-based separation performance for -100 mesh coal. Required volumetric flow rate is around 15 gpm/start and feed solids content should be nearly 15% by weight. Currently, two U.S. coal preparation plants use spirals in this application.

The demystification of dewatering screens. Dewatering screens were first introduced to the mining industry nearly 40 years ago as a more efficient means of dewatering minus 6.35mm solids contained in slurries. In most operations they replaced older technology such as screws/spirals or rake classifiers because they delivered a drier product.
