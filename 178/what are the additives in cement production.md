Feb 10, 2021In some cases, they catalyze the C3S hydration reaction to produce earlier initial set and strength. Cement additives with retarding properties improve the flow and set properties of cement. Na/Ca chlorides and Na acetate/formate are helpful for increasing early strength of cement. Polymer-based additives can contribute to the fluidity of the mix.

## Additives vs. Admixtures - Difference Wiki
Additives vs. Admixtures. The additive is those ingredients that are added to cement during the process of manufacturing of cement in any industry whereas admixtures are those ingredients which are added to concrete during mixing and results in better workability of concrete while reducing the water-cement ratio and increasing strength.

##  ENERGY STAR Guide for the Cement Industry
The production of cement results in the emission of carbon dioxide from both the consumption of fuels and from the calcination of limestone. This report briefly describes the various stages in the cement production process. Details on energy consumption in the U.S. cement industry in 2009 and 2010 are provided, followed by an assessment of various
