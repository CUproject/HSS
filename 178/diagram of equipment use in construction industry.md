Many types of soil are solid and tightly packed, requiring the hoe to break them apart first. After the soil is aggregated with a hoe, it's easy to remove the excess top layer and level the ground. 11. Rake. Rakes are another horticultural tool that sees widespread use in preparing construction sites.

## Construction Equipment Types And Construction Equipment List
Feb 7, 2021The construction machinery and equipment used in the construction industry have a long history of use. In the last few decades, there has been an explosion in the industry's growth due to its demand for materials and resources. The primary function of these machines is to move or shift material from one place to another.
