## Beneficiation
Iron beneficiation has been evident since as early as 800 BC in China with the use of bloomery.  The ore needs to have the sulfur removed before smelting can begin. Roasting is the primary method of separating, where wood was placed on heaps of ore and set on fire to help with oxidation.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Services Mexico-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel producers, generally less than 50% grade iron ore can be smelting for use after beneficiation. Iron ore is also used as a catalyst for ammonia (pure magnetite), natural mineral pigments (hematite, limonite), feed additives (magnetite, hematite,) and valuable constructive criticism (magnetite) and

## Flotation Iron Ore And Sulphur In The Iron Ore
The other is to reduce the sulfur content via the iron ore beneficiation process. As a sorting process, flotation plays a fundamental role in this. The objective of the test campaign described below was to reduce the sulfur content in an iron ore concentrate from 1.3 to less than 0.4 .  Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology Reverse Flotation
