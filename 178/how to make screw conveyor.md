Special flights and casings are available for operations, such as mixing

If the flight involves varying sheet thickness, or literal stretching (not just bending) of material, SW (& other "mid-range" 3D systems) will not be able to create a flat. The sheet thickness is to be uniform (not varying). I assume the flight is (basically) like a stretched spring with a rectangulr profile bent the 'wrong' way.

A screw conveyor is made of a housing, typically a tube or a U trough, in which is rotating a screw flight or auger (helical shaped blade) that allows to mechanically move bulk materials. The screw can be shaftless, or having a shaft on which is welded the helical blade. Screw conveyors are a very popular equipment in solids processing industry

## Screw Conveyor Design, Application and Selection Guidelines, History - USA
The design of the screw is based on the theory of the inclined plane. The screw conveyor began to evolve in the late 1800s and was used as a means of increasing food and grain production to meet the needs of the rapidly growing American population. The first feed mills used screw conveyors throughout the process.

## Overcoming Technical Challenges of Longer Screw Conveyors
A screw conveyor works well horizontally or on a gentle incline and should normally not have a cross-sectional load above 45 percent fill. If material fill exceeds the height of the center shaft, material can tumble back into the preceding pitch space, causing a 'cascade effect' as material moves backwards to the fill point.

## Essential Design Elements for Auger Screw Conveyors
Jun 10, 2021When designing a screw conveyor, there are several important elements to consider: Capacity. To determine the appropriate screw diameter, calculate the volume per hour that the screw conveyor will need to transport. Design and drive. Given the range of different screw designs, the design must consider the ultimate goal of the conveyor.
