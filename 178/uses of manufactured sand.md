## Manufactured Sand Or M-Sand For Construction - Daily Civil
Manufactured Sand. Manufactured sand or M-Sand is a replacement of natural river sand made artificially from hard granite stone by crushing. M-sand is cubical in shape and edges are rounded. After crushing, the sand is clearly washed and graded properly for using as construction material. Generally, the size of M-sand is less than 4.75 mm.

Manufactured Sand. Our Manufactured Sand can be kiln dried. It creates more reliable and consistent cement and mortar mixes compared to river sand. Manufactured Sand is also a superior alternative to decomposed granite or paver sand. It lacks the impurities found in river sand and is stronger than decomposed granite, so it will last longer.
