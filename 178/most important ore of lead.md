## Galena
Galena, also called lead glance, is the natural mineral form of lead(II) sulfide (PbS). It is the most important ore of lead and an important source of silver.. Galena is one of the most abundant and widely distributed sulfide minerals.It crystallizes in the cubic crystal system often showing octahedral forms. It is often associated with the minerals sphalerite, calcite and fluorite

## Lead (Galena) Facts - Mineral
The most common ore mineral of lead mined in the United States is galena with the chemical symbol PbS. Galena is lead sulfide with a hardness of 2.5 on the Moh's scale - actually quite soft- but it is VERY heavy with a specific gravity of 7.4 to 7.6. To put that in perspective, it weighs about 700 pounds per cubic foot!
