The production of sand fillers is simple because it includes, at most, only washing and classification into grades differing in grain size. Because sand has a negligible degree of porosity, it has an extremely low specific surface area in the range from 40 to 160 cm 2 /g. The material usually contains more than 99.7% SiO 2, with absorbed water being at a negligible level (0.1%).
