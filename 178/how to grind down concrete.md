The best way to make informed decisions about tools is by calculating and monitoring your tool performance. To calculate the performance of your tools: Step 1: Measure the area to be ground (never estimate). Step 2: Calculate the grinding time by subtracting any stoppage time from the total shift time. Step 3: Divide the square feet ground by

## How to Fix Raised Concrete - Mother Daughter Projects
Grinding can be a quick solution, but you really need to find out why the concrete settled (or lifted). If it was just shifting footings the problem may reappear or cause cracking issues and require additional grinding or more long term solutions like injecting polyurethane foam under the sidewalks to stabilize it and/or fill any potential voids.
