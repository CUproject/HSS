##  Survey On Coal Mine Safety Monitoring Systems
paper, a survey on various mine monitoring systems is discussed. Keywords - coal mining, mine environment, safety issues. I. INTRODUCTION The safety issues of coal mines have turned into a major concern for society. Coal is an important source of energy for operating industries and thus plays a pivotal role in the national economy.

## Safety performance of coal mine survey technology using nano-fiber 
In order to ensure the safety of coal mining process, in this study, the coal mine survey technology based on nano-fibers is analyzed and Marston-Spangler theory is used to calculate the vertical earth pressure, and then evaluate the safety of coal mining process. The research results show that the whole process of coal mining by using advanced nano-fiber material technology is discussed
