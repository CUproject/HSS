## Components of Thermal Power Plant & Working Explanation
Steam Boiler is main component of thermal plants. Water-tube boiler consists of a furnace enclosed by the water tubes membrane. The crushed fuel from the crushers is fed into the boiler furnace over the grate. The hot air from the Forced Draft (FD) fan is mixed with the crushed fuel causing combustion of fuel.

## Thermal Power Plant - Components, Working and Site Selection
Thermal efficiency is defined as the ratio of heat equivalent mechanical energy available at the turbine to the heat energy available at the combustion of coal in the boiler. The thermal efficiency of the thermal power plants is 30% approx. Most of the heat energy (approx. 50%) is wasted in the condenser.
