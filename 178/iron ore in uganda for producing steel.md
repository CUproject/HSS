## Iron & Steel Industry in India: Production, Market Size, Growth | IBEF
In FY22, the production of crude steel and finished steel stood at 133.596 MT and 120.01 MT, respectively. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron ore and cost-effective labour.
