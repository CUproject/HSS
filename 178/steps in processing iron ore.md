We can extract the iron by reacting the iron oxide with a more reactive element. The more reactive element takes away the oxygen. The raw materials are Haematite (iron ore), Coke (impure C), Limestone (CaCO 3) Make a strong reducing agent. C + O 2 → CO 2. CO 2 + C → 2CO. Reduce the iron 3. Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.
