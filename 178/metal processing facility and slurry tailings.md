## Forward Thinking: Dry-Stack Tailings - Eldorado Gold blog
Fundamentally, mining involves processing ore that has been mined to separate valuable minerals and metals from the rocks in which they are found. These processes use machine technologies and water-based solutions to isolate the valuable metals, leaving behind an uneconomic mix of water and waste rock, called tailings.
