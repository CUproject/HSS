## Compressive Strength of Concrete & Concrete Cubes | What | How
The strength of concrete is controlled by the proportioning of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, water, and various admixtures. The ratio of the water to cement is the chief factor for determining concrete strength. The lower the water-cement ratio, the higher is the compressive strength. The capacity of concrete is reported in psi - pounds

The results of the study have thus proved the effective use of quarry dust powder in developing concrete building blocks in an economic, effective and sustainable way.  Thus, increase in porosity can lead to a reduction in compressive strength of concrete. Workability is thus brought to an average range and compressive strengths are compared

This study tried to compare the flexural strength of concrete made with riversand and quarry dust as fine aggregate.River sand was collected from Osogbo, Osun State, replaced at 0-100% at intervals of 10% with quarry dust gotten from Wasimi, Osun State, Nigeria.Abstract Common river sand is expensive due to the excessive cost of transportation from natural sources.

Compressive strength refers to the ability of a certain material or structural element to withstand loads that reduce the size of that material, or structural element, when applied. A force is applied to the top and bottom of a test sample, until the sample fractures or is deformed . Materials such as concrete and rock are often evaluated

The project is about replacing sand in concrete production with quarry dust at varying percentage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to check if the strength matches that of grade MIS with a mix ratio of I :2:4 and also the proportion which has the highest strength. The test carried out includes particle size analysis, slump test, and compressive test.

## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
Answer (1 of 8): Of course. Quite a standard procedure. We call it crusher dust, or manufactured sand. Dependent on the source rock and type of crusher, the particle shape is unlikely to be nice round grains, which makes for concrete that is not quite as nice to play with, but it is still far fr

## Compressive Strength Of Concrete | What you need to know
Feb 19, 2022The compressive strength of concrete is defined as the resistance to failure under the decided force. It is the maximum load applied at any cross-sectional area. You can calculate the compressive strength of concrete by the formula, F = P / A. Where, F is the compressive strength. P is the maximum load applied in Newton.
