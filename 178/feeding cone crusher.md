## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Cone Crushers Work. Feed from a feed hopper is fed into a large opening at the top of the cone crusher. Feed then falls due to gravity and is crushed between the mantle and concaves; crushing takes place in the crushing chamber. As the feed moves towards the drive end of the cone crusher, its size decreases (due to the crushing action), and

## Why should be overcrowded feeding for cone crusher?
Reply: Hi Hector. Thank you for your question. The crushing chamber of cone crusher is a space between two moving parts, that is, the space between fixed cone lining plate and moving cone lining plate. That is to say, the upper part of the crushing chamber is the feeding space, and the lower part is the discharging space.

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Feed Opening. Looking at the cone crusher diagram above, the feed opening is the first aspect of the machine. The feed opening is where the raw material feeds into the crusher. Even the largest cone crushers are limited by the size of their feed opening, as they can only accommodate pieces of rock or substrate that will fit inside the machine.

## Common Feed arrangement problems â SRP
Poor feed arrangements affect crusher performance, liner life and the life of mechanical components, so it is crucial that you can identify and deal with any problems. In general terms, the goal is evenly distributed, non-segregated feed. It sounds straightforward, but issues can quickly develop if you're not vigilant. Here are the most common problems to look out for, and some pointers

As with other compression crushers, the cone crusher yields a somewhat elongated and slivery particle shape. This may be minimized, however, by choke feeding the crusher. This technique will also make the shape and size more uniform. One way to choke feed is with a surge hopper and a controlled belt-feed to the cone crusher (Figure 5-10).
