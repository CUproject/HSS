## Is there limestone in South Carolina? - 2022
Dec 14, 2021Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However, underground limestone mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States, especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime- stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.

Quarries provide stone materials that make up the basis of infrastructure. Monroe in relation to its quarries is also an interesting topic. Low levels of overburden and a wide variety of geological formations make it an ideal location to begin a quarry; many quarrying companies have picked up on these specialties as shown in this map.
