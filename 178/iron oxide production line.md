Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen.Several iron oxides are recognized. All are black magnetic solids. Often they are nonstoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.. Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes.

## A single exposure to iron oxide nanoparticles attenuates antigen 
For example, iron oxide nanoparticles have been shown to suppress the phagocytic activity of Raw 264.7 cells, a murine macrophage line. 10 Exposure of primary macrophages to iron oxide nanoparticles in culture resulted in a marked induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis. 11 Furthermore, animal studies have shown that intratracheal
