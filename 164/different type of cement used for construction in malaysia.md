## Types of Paint used in Building Construction (7 Different Types)
1.Emulsion paints: Emulsion paint is the dispersion of rubber-like resin in water, while water is used as a thinner in place of organic solvents. Therefore emulsion has two phases, one of which is water, this paint can easily be diluted or the surface forming material (synthetic resin) is dispersed in water by a dispersing agent.

## Different Types Of Cement Used In Building Construction
Jan 7, 2022There are four types of ordinary Portland cement grades: Type I: Type I is the highest quality and has a relative compressive strength of 95-105 MPa (i.e., megapascals). Type II: Type II has a relative compressive strength of 90-95 MPa and is used in moderate to high-strength concrete applications. Type III: Type III has a relative compressive

## How are the different types of cement used in construction?
Answer: generally for all small scale work portland pozzolana cement is used but in all large scale projects only ordinary portland cement is used and certain admixtures like accelerating. retarding, air entraining, viscosity modifier, water reducing etc are added to it as per the industry req
