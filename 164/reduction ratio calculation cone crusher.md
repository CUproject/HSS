## how to calculate jaw crusher reduction ratio
Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept.

## Ez crusher priceerzentrum-barmstedt
The design of EZ can crusher is very similar to Commercial Zone Can Pactor. The tool is in a black color and has got three mounting holes on the body of the crusher and it can be installed to a vertical surface such as a wall or to a horizontal surface such as table.  Pretty high price for a single can crusher .
