Super sulfate cement is made by grinding a mixture of 80-85% selected GBFS with 10-15% calcium sulfate and about 5% of Portland cement clinker. It is generally used where high sulfate, acid and organic oil attacks on a structure are expected. Again the cost of this type of cement is high, due to the limited availability of materials.

The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 μm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the early 19th century by Joseph Aspdin, and is usually made from limestone.It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker

## Clinker grinding technology in cement manufacturing
Clinker grinding technology is the most energy-intensive process in cement manufacturing. Traditionally, it was treated as "low on technology" and "high on energy" as grinding circuits use more than 60 per cent of total energy consumed and account for most of the manufacturing cost. Since the increasing energy cost started burning the benefits significantly, the [.]

## Manufacturing process of ceramicofy
Ceramic tile production process - In general, there are currently two methods for making ceramic tile products in the world, the difference between which is the method of drying and baking tiles. In the first type, it is double firing. In this method, after drying the tiles in the dryer, the tiles are baked once under high heat in the oven.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process - Advancing Mining
Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are
