## Separation processes in industry - Anuja Sawant
This is why we need separation. Various separation processes exist in an industry and depending on the applicability, one process is chosen over the rest. Some of these processes are: Evaporation (e.g. recovering salts from solution) Absorption (e.g. separation of NH3 from a mixture) Crystallization (e.g. purification of solid compounds)

The cement industry is likely to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat anthropogenic climate change. Many decarbonization pathways suggest that direct specific emission levels of around 350 - 410 kg CO 2 /t cement will be required. However, increasing clinker substitution, alternative fuel use, and thermal energy efficiency can only lead to specific emissions per tonne
