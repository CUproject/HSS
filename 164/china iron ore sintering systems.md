Sinter plant Know More. Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines dust with other fine materials at high temperature to create a product that can be used in a blast furnaceThe final product a sinter is a small irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals The process called sintering causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change

## How to Achieve Uniform Sinter Quality - Analyzing Metals
Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron in a blast furnace. During the iron ore sintering process in iron and steel manufacturing, sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace. The production of high-quality sinter is crucial for assuring

## magnetic sinter iron ore
Iron Ore Concentrate Iron ore concentrate is produced from the magnetite iron ore in the beneficiation process and is used for the production of pellets for blast furnaces and sinter The concentrates are non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive The concentrate is shipped as a bulk commodity by rail using the open-top rolling stock and by sea

quality of the sinter produced. To comply with environmental legislation, a pollution control system must monitor the particle matter and gases generated and emitted into the atmosphere by the sinter plant. Automation and control systems are vital tools to assist plant operators in the monitoring of each stage of the sinter production process.
