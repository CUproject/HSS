The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

The coarse 1 and fine 2 fractions can be used as recycled aggregates [4] in mortar and concrete mixtures, among other applications (bases and subbases [5
