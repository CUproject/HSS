## New Zealand limestone origins — Science Learning Hub
The major limestone-forming period in New Zealand was during the Oligocene, about 22-30 million years ago. At that time, New Zealand was covered almost entirely by a shallow sea. Many invertebrate organisms with calcareous shells thrived in this sea, and over time, a thick sedimentary layer of shell fragments developed.
