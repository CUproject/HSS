Volatile organic compounds (coke oven gas), tar, and sulfur compounds are removed in this process. Coke oven gas is used in the steelmaking process. Coke breeze (a residue from the screening of heat-treated coke [34]) is used in an iron ore agglomeration process, which aggregates fine ore so that it can be used in blast furnaces. Sintering and

## Morphology of Iron and Agglomeration Behaviour During  - SpringerLink
Sticking and agglomeration occurred regardless of the iron oxides and reducing atmosphere. Reduction by CO showed a higher tendency for sticking due to the formation of iron whiskers. The addition of CaO and MgO to Fe2O3 in sintering process could improve the reduction, and also decrease the sticking by forming calcio/magnesio-wustite on the
