## The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small-Scale Miners
Background. More than ten million small-scale miners (SSM) worldwide use mercury to extract gold, releasing large amounts of the toxic element into the environment. Alternatives to mercury have been suggested over the years to little avail. A group of miners in the Philippines has demonstrated that borax, when used as a flux for smelting gold out of heavy mineral concentrates, is an effective

Refining with borax is a bit of a misnomer, using it on a concentrate is more of a recovery method. You won't get .999 gold that way, as in, "refined" gold.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Genera Processing Technology For Minerals | Prominer (Shanghai) Mining 
Flotation is a typical mineral ore processing method based on the difference of the physical and chemical property and floatability between valuable minerals and veins. Technically, flotation can be used in almost all of the mineral separation. It is especially efficient to process metal and non-metal minerals like copper, pyrite, iron, gold
