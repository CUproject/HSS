## An adaptive in-network aggregation operator for query processing in 
Adaptive query operators (algorithms) can adjust their behavior in response to specific events that take place during data processing. In this paper, we propose an adaptive in-network aggregation operator for query processing in sensor nodes of a WSN, called ADAGA (ADaptive AGgregation Algorithm for sensor networks).

Based on the path encoding scheme and the numbering scheme, we devise a storage scheme to process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently. Finally, we propose a method which translates the queries to SQL queries. Experimental results show that our approach can process the queries efficiently.

To split a string in bash using IFS, follow the below steps: Step 1: Set IFS to the delimiter you would want. IFS='<delimiter>' IFS is an internal variable that determines how Bash recognizes word boundaries. The default value of IFS is white space. If you set it to some other value, reset it to default whitespace.

## An energy aware sensor network query processing system
Such errors may seriously impact the answer to any query posed in the network. An energy efficient approach to query processing is intro- duced in this paper by implementing new optimization techniques applied to in-network aggregation. We first discuss earlier approaches in sensors data management and highlight their disadvantages.
