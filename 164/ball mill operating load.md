Operating life The operating life is defined as the life actually achieved by the planetary screw drive. It may differ significantly from the basic, calculated life. Possible causes of premature failure due to wear or fatigue include: excessive loads as a result of misalignments contamination inadequate lubrication. .

##  Module #5: Functional Perfomance of Ball Milling
you cannot use work index analysis for the same purpose on ball mill circuits because of the complex interactions between grinding and classification. In this module, you will learn how to relate design and operating variables to ball mill circuit efficiency through functional performance analysis. This Introduction is seven pages long.

For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.

A Ball Mill grinds material by rotating a cylinder with steel grinding balls, causing the balls to fall back into the cylinder and onto the material to be ground. The rotation is usually between 4 to 20 revolutions per minute, depending upon the diameter of the mill. The larger the diameter, the slower the rotation.

Therefore, ball mill should be run under optimal operating condition, avoiding the incident of over-load and low-load operating states. Ball mill load status has significant effect on the . operating. efficiency, product quality and energy consumption for the grinding process. Measurements on mill load mainly depend on the

## Ball Mill Operation -Grinding Circuit Startup & Shutdown Procedure
The ore feed rate must be adjusted to suit the mill load condition, for instance, increase feed rate to an under loaded mill.  In the event of an emergency, the mill feed conveyor is shut down individually or by stopping the operating cyclone feed pump. The ball mill must be shut down separately. All equipment shutdowns are performed locally
