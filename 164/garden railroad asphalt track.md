Since 1981 about 30 experimental sections of hot-mix asphalt trackbeds have been built and evaluated. The hot-mix asphalt can be used either as an overlay placed directly under the tie or as an underlay placed under the ballast.

Trains look better and run better on wider curves. For turnouts (switches) that your mainline traffic will be running through, select turnouts that have at least as wide a radius as the track you are using (for sidings that you will only be putting short freight cars on, you may use turnouts with tighter curves).

Oct 28, 2020Place your longest carriage on the outside track and lightly tack a pen to the centre of the coach. Push it around the curve so that the pen marks the baseboard. Repeat with the pen fixed to one end of the same carriage now on the inside track. If the lines do not meet then the rails are far enough apart.

## Rail-Highway Operations Manual: Railroad Crossing Surfaces
Crossing Surface Details. Railroad crossing surfaces typically include the following characteristics: Surface is made of precast concrete panels 8 feet in length along the length of the track. Composite material may be used in lieu of concrete in areas of significant truck traffic where material will not degrade in climate conditions.

## Module 11: Choosing the Track | Garden Railway Guide
In Large-Scale track descriptions often refer to a "Code". This is rather an anachronistic reference these days to imperial units of measurement (not metric) and refers to the height of the running rail in thousandths of an inch so Code 250 for example is 0.250 inches high and Code 332 rail is 0.332 inches high (equivalent to between 6.7" high at 1:20.3 scale to 10.6" at 1:32 scale.)

Railroad "gauge" refers to track size whereas "scale" measures the size relationship between a model train and its real-world train prototype. For example, a model locomotive that is 1/24th the size of the real thing is called 1:24 scale.  Garden Railroads are model railroad layouts placed outside, usually winding through backyard
