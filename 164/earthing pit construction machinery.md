## What is Earthing or Grounding? Its Purpose and Types.
Purpose of Earthing. 1. As a safety feature for property, equipment and life - An earthed circuit reduces the risk of death or injury by providing an alternate path for current to discharge into the ground. Appliances, Equipment, property and lives are protected against faults, leaks and fires resulting from short-circuits and sparking.

## Earth Pit - Technical Aspects & Construction | Blog - Axis Electricals
Requirements of Earth Pits: An earth pit is required to construct a channel for the additional charge generated during operation. A low-resistance path allows excess current to flow freely while keeping the equipment secure. Where there is a potential source, earthing is essential at that time. In the maximum sector, earth-pit inspections are

## Substation Earthing System ( Grounding System ) - Earthing Mat
The grounding system in substation is very important. The functions of grounding systems or earth mat in include: Ensure safety to personnel in substations against electrical shocks. Provide the ground connection for connecting the neutrals of stat connected transformer winding to earth ( neutral earthing ).
