## Phosphorus Removal From Wastewater, Reduce Sludge From Wastewater
The Key to Removing Phosphorus: A Strong Chemical Bond. Neo Water Treatment's Neo WaterFX 300 (formerly RE300) product uses rare earth elements to remove phosphorus. Rare earths form a strong crystalline ionic bond with phosphates, unlike the chemical approach of iron- and aluminum-based coagulants, which do not bind to phosphorus as efficiently.

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

## Processes for phosphorus removal from iron ore - a review
This paper aims at reviewing literature on the occurrence of phosphorus in iron ores from the mines around the world. The review extends to the phosphorus removal processes of this mineral to meet the specifications of the steel industry. Phosphorus is a contaminant that can be hard to remove, especially when one does not know its mode of occurrence in the ores.

Oct 27, 2021For example, Rana Grubery conducted a variety of phosphorus removal processes for iron ore in the Lana plant. It was concluded that the best results were achieved with this process, and the iron concentrate grade could be increased to 65. %, phosphorus content is reduced to less than 0.015%.

Alkali-leaching and acid-leaching were proposed for the dephosphorization of Changde iron ore, which contains an average of 1.12% for phosphorus content. Sodium hydroxide, sulfuriced, hydrochloric and nitric acids were used for the preparation of leach solutions. The results show that phosphorus occurring as apatite phase could be removed by alkali-leaching, but those occurring in the iron

## Phosphorus Removal From Iron Concentrate
Jun 18, 2021 The effect of leaching time on the quality of iron ore concentrate and phosphorus removal is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from Figure 1 When the leaching time of sulfuric acid is 0.52.0 h, the grade of iron ore concentrate gradually increases and the phosphorus content decreases by prolonging the leaching time.

##  Predictability of Phosphorus Removal Based on Simultaneously Removed 
apatite concentrate obtained from the dephosphorization of iron ore. In this process, the apatite is acidulated by HNO. 3 to produce high-purity H 3PO 4. The crude acid  predicted model indicate that phosphorus removal [8] from the iron oxide ore is dependent on the initial and final pH of the leaching solution. This is because the final
