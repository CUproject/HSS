Molasses is the "glue" that holds the other ingredients of deer blocks together. In some areas, I have seen deer blocks eaten in a couple of days, while within just a few miles of difference, I've seen deer blocks rot, untouched! Generally, its pretty cheap, and unless the deer have a much better food source, they should like it!.

## Calcium phosphate
The term calcium phosphate refers to a family of materials and minerals containing calcium ions (Ca 2+) together with inorganic phosphate anions. Some so-called calcium phosphates contain oxide and hydroxide as well. Calcium phosphates are white solids of nutritious value and are found in many living organisms, e.g., bone mineral and tooth enamel. In milk, it exists in a colloidal form in

Calcium is cold, hard and static. It is the key ingredient in concrete. Calcium gives rigidity to our bones and teeth. Where phosphorus is energy in motion, calcium is structure.

## Molecular characterization and organic acid production of mineral 
Ten bacteria were identified as efficient mineral phosphate solubilizers namely 7 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All the ten strains were able to dissolve calcium phosphate (Ca-P), ferric phosphate (Fe-P) and aluminium phosphate (Al-P) efficiently.

Reimphoto / Getty Images Apatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F) is a key part of the phosphorus cycle. It is widespread but uncommon in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Apatite is a family of minerals centered around fluorapatite, or calcium phosphate with a bit of fluorine, with the formula Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F. Other members of the apatite group have chlorine or hydroxyl that take the place of the fluorine

Hydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (OH), but it is usually written Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group.The OH − ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate

## Engineering Calcium-Bearing Mineral/Hydrogel Composites for Effective 
Sep 14, 2021Effectively recovering phosphate from wastewater streams and reutilizing it as a nutrient will critically support sustainability. Here, to capture aqueous phosphate, we developed novel mineral-hydrogel composites composed of calcium alginate, calcium phosphate (CaP), and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) (CaP + CSH/Ca-Alg). The CaP + CSH/Ca-Alg composites were synthesized by dripping a sodium

## The Inhibition of Calcium Phosphate Precipitation by Fetuin Is 
The present studies show that the previously reported ability of fetuin to inhibit the precipitation of hydroxyapatite from supersaturated solutions of calcium and phosphate in vitro is accompanied by the formation of the fetuin-mineral complex, a high molecular mass complex of calcium phosphate mineral and the proteins fetuin and matrix Gla protein that was initially discovered in the serum
