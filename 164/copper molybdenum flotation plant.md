## The use of seawater as process water at Las Luces copper-molybdenum 
Las Luces is a copper-molybdenum beneficiation plant in Taltal (Chile), owned by the Las Cenizas Mining Group (Grupo Minero Las Cenizas) of Chile. The plant comprised of conventional crushing, grinding and flotation facilities. Las Luces has treated 720,000 tpa ore since 1995. This ore was supplied from Las Cenizas' own underground mines
