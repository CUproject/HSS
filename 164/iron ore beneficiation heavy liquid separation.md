The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

39.3.3 Heavy media separation. Heavy media separation dates back to several centuries. Initially, a fine magnetite was used as a heavy media. In 1936, a plant was designed employing organic liquid as a heavy media for treating anthracite coal containing ore. The heavy media process is usually used for treatment of coarse coal above 9.5 mm in size.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores
Feed for the dense media separation must be hard and compact with non poor us gangue material. Heavy media cyclone - The process is used for iron ore fines with size range o f 0. Mm to 6 mm. The cyclone type separator utilizes centrifugal as well as gravitational forces to make separation between ore an d gangue material.

## heavy medium separation process iron ore
magnetic separation of iron in mining. Magnetic separation for mining industry - Magnetense. This type of magnetic separation machine is used in wet separation processes for smaller than 1,2 mm ( - 200 mesh of 30100 %) of fine grained red mine (hematite) limonite, manganese ore, ilmenite and some kinds of weakly magnetic minerals like quartz, feldspar, nepheline ore and kaolin in order to
