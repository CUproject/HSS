The Black Diamond Mines had more coal output than any other set of mines within the state of California and continued to operate until 1900. Ultimately, the rising cost of mining coal, and the increase of the demand for oil due to the increase in automobile usage, lead the owner of the Black Diamond Mines to cease operations.
