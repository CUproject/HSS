## Using Gypsum to Help Reduce Phosphorus Runoff | USDA
Torbert and colleagues working in Beltsville, Oxford and elsewhere, also have found that gypsum reduces the potential for pathogens, such as E. coli, in poultry litter and cow manure to be transported in runoff and reach drinking water supplies. The gypsum improves soil infiltration and curbs algae growth by binding with phosphorus in the soil

Jul 7, 2021Gypsum is a water-soluble mineral that is high in calcium and has multiple uses in the agricultural sector. It is widely used as a fertilizer and can assist in treating the irrigation water. When gypsum is applied directly over the soil or added in the irrigation water, the water that is high in sodium is structurally modified.

Overall, AMD beneficiation and valorisation appears promising since the reclaimed water and the recovered minerals/metals could offset treatment costs and environmental impacts. However, the main challenges include high-cost, complexity, co-contamination in the recovered minerals, and the generation of a higly heterogeneous and mineralised sludge.
