The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

Feb 15, 2019 Aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate crushing value should not exceed 45% for aggregate used for concrete other than for wearing surfaces, and 30 % for concrete for wearing surfaces, such as runways, roads for pavements.

## Disadvantages of glass powder in concrete
The government of Quebec (Canada) is trying to find a useful outlet for the mixed waste glass pilling up in its landfills. One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle.

## Limits Of Natural Aggregate Crushing Value
Crushing value 5.88 0.96 as per is permissible limit of crushing value being up to 30. crushing value of natural aggregate is 5.88 and of plastic aggregate is 0.96, which is within permissible limit. this shows that plastic aggregate have more compressive strength than natural aggregate. as per is 2386 part iv1963 aggregate.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
The table given below lays down specified limits of percent aggregate crushing value, for different types of road construction. Table3. The specified limits of pe cent aggregate crushing value. Note:- For strong aggregate, crushing value should be low. For surface courses this value should not exceed more than 30% and for courses not more than 45%.
