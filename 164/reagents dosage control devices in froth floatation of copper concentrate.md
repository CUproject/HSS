## Copper Mining Froth Flotation Reagents Q30 High Mud Content Mines
Introduction. Flotation foaming agent q30. It is applicable to the beneficiation process of oxidized ore, nonferrous ore and precious metal ore with high mud content. The foaming agent has uniform bubbles, large bubbles and good mineralization effect, which is conducive to improving the concentrate grade. The dosage is generally 5-30g / T.

## 4 Nickel Sulfide Froth Flotation Processes and 2 Common Reagents
Aug 18, 2022Nickel sulfide ore generally contains copper, so it can also be called copper-nickel sulfide ore. This type of ore is mostly magma-melted copper-nickel ore. When the nickel content is above 3%, it is called rich ore and can be directly smelted. When the nickel content is less than 3%, it needs to be purified by beneficiation method. At present, the most common method is flotation.

The process involves the aeration of minerals in water in the presence of flotation reagents which facilitate the attachment of air bubbles to and levitation of select minerals. Once at the surface, the select minerals are supported by a froth layer until they are removed. Unattached materials remain submerged in the pulp.

Flotation is an important part of coal preparation, and the flotation column is widely applied as efficient flotation equipment. This process is complex and affected by many factors, with the froth depth and reagent dosage being two of the most important and frequently manipulated variables. This paper proposes a new method of switching and optimizing control for the coal flotation process.

Copper Sulfide Flotation Circuit. The pulp from the Conditioner is treated in a 10-cell "Sub-A" Flotation Machine and a 4-cell "Sub-A" Flotation machine. Sometimes conditioners are not provided; however, their use insures that reagents are thoroughly mixed into the pulp ahead of flotation.

## Reagent dosages control based on bubble size characteristics for 
this paper, the effectiveness of proposed reagent dosage control method is proved by industrial data. This paper is organised as follows: ﬁrst, the statistical distribu-tion of the bubble size is presented in Section 2. Section 3 describes the reagent dosage control based on the froth size distribution.

## Copper Flotation, Extraction of Copper, Copper Processing  - Xinhai
The dewatering of copper, lead and zinc concentrates used Xinhai efficient deep cone thickener + ceramic filter. The concentrate moisture was about 12% after dewatering. Process Indicator: Copper concentrate grade:40%; Copper recovery rate:83.45%; Lead concentrate grade:50.13%; Zinc concentrate grade:84.68%.
