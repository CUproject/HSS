## Malachite For Sale
Malachite Malachite (Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2) is a secondary mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth.It results from the chemical weathering of copper minerals, as when carbonated water reacts with native copper, or copper solutions react with limestone.Green tarnish on copper is Malachite. Malachite may have been the first copper ore to be mined, as early as 3000 BCE in ancient Egypt.

## Cobalt mineral colorzkibetonowe-opole.pl
Cobalt normally happens in nickel bearing laterites and nickel-copper sulfide stores and, accordingly, is frequently separated as a by-result of nickel and copper. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. Silver-colored cobalt metal is brittle, has a high melting point.

## Malachite: Uses and properties of the mineral and gemstone - Geology
Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu 2 (CO 3 ) (OH) 2. It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal. It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use.

## Why is azurite blue and malachite green?sewing
Score: 4.5/5 (53 votes) . Malachite and azurite are two copper carbonates that are minor ore minerals. Azurite, as its name might suggest, is the blue one, which obviously leaves malachite as the green one.  These are secondary minerals, meaning that they formed by alteration of the original copper ore minerals.
