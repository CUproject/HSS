The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.

##  Atmospheric pressure leaching application for the recovery of copper 
In this study, the copper tailings were upgraded using the Knelson concentrator (KC-MD3) prior to the leaching process, in an attempt to remove the gangue minerals such as iron, magnesium, and aluminium. Atmospheric leaching was conducted to determine the effect of the upgrading process on impurity co-extraction and copper recovery.

##  17 - Flotation of Gold Ores - Aalto
ores that contain impurities that result in high consumption of cyanide, which have to be removed before cyanidation. 4. The flotation method is a technique widely used for the recovery of gold from gold-containing copper ores, base metal ores, copper nickel ores, platinum group ores and many other ores where other processes are not applicable.
