## Lithium mining is booming — here's how to manage its impact
Aug 11, 2021Commonly, extracting lithium from these deposits involves two methods. One is building a mine, extracting the clay or ore, and separating the metal through a complex process. The second is to pump underground water deposits to the surface. The resulting pools of briny liquid are left to evaporate, and lithium is removed from the dried salts
