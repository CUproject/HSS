## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The gyratory crusher can work continuously in a full cavity without a feeding device. It can directly feed materials to the gyratory crusher by multiple vehicles, so the production capacity is large ( t/h), the unit energy consumption is small, and the work is stable. The noise is small.

## power consumption in gyratory crusher
Power Consumption of Gyratory and Cone Crushers To compute the power consumption of gyratory crushers, knowledge of the ore work index and crusher capacity is necessary. In its simplest form, the power consumption is given by (5.5) P = W iQ F 80 − P 80 F 80 100 P 80where P = power (kW) W i = work index (kWh/t) Get A Quote
