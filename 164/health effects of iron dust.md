Abstract: Different lung diseases including lung cancer are the major occupational diseases among the workers of iron ore dust. However, health hazards that arise due to exposures to the ore dust vary considerably due to its variable composition in different mines. Iron oxide and silica predominantly contribute to its toxicological properties.

Oxygen absorbers are small packets that are added to food containers to remove oxygen. The oxygen is intentionally removed to preserve the food. Removing the oxygen can keep some types of bacteria and fungi from growing, and will keep oils from becoming rancid. Oxygen in food packages could also allow food to discolor and change in texture.
