## What is the Etching Process in Semiconductor? - ChipEdge VLSI Training 
Mar 16, 2022The process of creating patterns or images on a metal plate, glass, or other surface by corrosive action of an acid is known as Etching. An etched plate is used to make an imprint on paper.In connection with semiconductor, Etching is a micro-fabrication technique for chemically removing layers from a wafer's surface during production.

## Advanced Process Control in Semiconductor Manufacturing - LTI
October 9, 2017. By: Krishna Pillai, Principal Consultant - Hi-Tech & Consumer Electronics Advanced Process Control (APC) techniques have matured in the semiconductor manufacturing facilities over the years. The availability and use of custom and off-the-shelf APC framework in a fab is taken for granted, as the devices and manufacturing techniques get more complex than ever before.
