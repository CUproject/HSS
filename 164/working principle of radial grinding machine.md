## Working principle of a grinding machine - studentlesson
The working of a grinding machine: A grinder features an electric motor that supplies motion power to the grinding wheel using pulley and belt. For the portable grinder, the rotor is inside the grinding machine and the power switch is located beside the handle of a grinder. So, the switch must be pressed before the grinder works.

## Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working Principle, Operation 
Grinding Machine Working Principle: In brief, we can say the working of the Grinding Machine is the Workpiece is fed against the rotating abrasive wheel. The action of rubbing or friction generates between wok price and tool therefore the material removes. Lets see step by step, First, clean the machine with a clean brush.

## What Is Grinding and Its Working Principle and Type?
Sep 28, 2021Grinding uses extremely fine micronized abrasives, and the machine tool, grinding tool, and workpiece are in an elastic floating working state. Under the action of low speed and low pressure, the convex points of the processed surface are successively ground, and the processing accuracy can reach 0. 1μm～0.01μm.

## Industrial Importance of Radial Drill Machine among wide array of Drill 
The radial drill machine is designed in a way to ensure accurate work with precision for ensuring smooth rotation of columns and avoiding angular deflection of the spindle axis. Also, this can be used to place fasteners in workshops. It cuts through the material and fastens the two pieces together at the same time.
