## Power plant and calculations: Calculation of raw water requirement and 
In order to calculate the raw water requirement for a power plant, first of all we should know the losses in power plant. As per new law raw water consumption should be 2.5 liters/kwh, presently it is around 4.5 liters/kwh. Different losses in power plants : A-Boiler. Boiler blow down : 2% of steam generation; Deaerator vent loss : 0.1% of

## Open Cycle and Closed cycle Circulating Water Systems in Thermal Power 
The Circulating water removes the heat from the condenser and flows to cooling towers. In the cooling towers an airflow, natural or forced, cools the water and the water returns to the condenser. Power plants located away from large sources of water utilise this type. The large concrete hyperbolic towers that you see near thermal power plants

## Circulating Water Requirements in a Thermal Power Plant.
The quantity of Circulating Water required is very high. Based on a simple heat balance, the requirement will be almost 65 to 70 times the steam flow entering the Turbine. A 600 MW thermal power plant uses around 1800 tons per hour of steam from the boiler. This means the circulating water requirement in tropical areas will be almost 120,000

## Cooling water system presentation - SlideShare
After circulation through the heat exchanger equipment, water is cooled in cooling tower. This cooling effect is produced by evaporation of a portion of circulating water because concentrated. The evaporated must be reproduced by make up water. The circulating water becomes more concentrated than the make up water due to evaporation loss.

Circulating water pump. Circulating pumps are used to supply cooling water to the condensers, oil coolers of steam turbine and the air coolers of electric generator. The amount of cooling water in power plants is large, but the pressure is generally not high. Therefore, the requirements for circulating water pumps are high flow rate and low lift.

Rodríguez Fernández, Ángel Most of the thermal power plants are cooled with water. This water can be interchanged between a condenser and the sea, a river, a lake, a cooling tower, etc. But always there must be pipes that connect the steam turbine condenser with the place where the water is cooled. There are some.

The circulating cooling water is the water consumption of coal-fired power plants, and the water consumption reaches 50-80% of the total water consumption of the power plants. Therefore, the treatment effect of the circulating water is closely related to the water saving and emission reduction efficiency of the power plant.

Biomass is plant-based material used as fuel to produce heat or electricity.Examples are wood and wood residues, energy crops, agricultural residues, and waste from industry, farms and households.

In the western US, wet-recirculating systems are predominant. Dry-cooling systems use air instead of water to cool the steam exiting a turbine. Dry-cooled systems use no water and can decrease total power plant water consumption by more than 90 percent. [2] The tradeoffs to these water savings are higher costs and lower efficiencies.

As a rule of thumb, the length of the chlorination cycle should be at least long enough to maintain the desired chlorine residual for one complete turnover of water. In the continuous chlorination method, 1-3 ppm is commonly reported. The Georgia Power Plant in Milledgeville, Ga., is one such plant that uses the continuous chlorination method.
