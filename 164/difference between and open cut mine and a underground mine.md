Opencut mining gets its name because that's exactly what this type of mining looks like, a big open pit. This type of mining allows for the extraction of minerals that aren't very far under the surface. The process keeps the activity from going deep underground. This has many advantages.

Nov 30, 2021Open-cut mining is a process of resource extraction where it is dug up from the surface. Also known as open-pit mining or open-cast mining, it is the most common form of extraction for minerals or coal in Australia. The technique of open-cut mining is used when the deposits are close enough to the surface to be readily extracted.

## Open Pit Mining Techniques|Surface Mines|Rock or Mineral Extraction
Open Pit Mining. Open-pit mining, also known as opencast mining, open-cut mining, and strip mining, means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.

Underhand Stoping Mining Method. The method of underhand stoping in which the ore is drawn to the level above (B, Fig. .1), is called Cornish stoping. It finds application only when it is necessary to mine a lens of good ore below a level and it is not practicable or financially possible to do the necessary development to come up from underneath.
