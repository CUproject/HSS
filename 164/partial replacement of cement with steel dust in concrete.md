The government of Quebec (Canada) is trying to find a useful outlet for the mixed waste glass pilling up in its landfills. One solution to consider is the use of fine glass powder from mixed waste glass as alternative cementitious materials (ACM) in concrete, using an open-loop circular-economy principle.

## Partial replacement of cement by ground granulated blast furnace slag 
Partial replacement of cement by GGBS and SF at 30 and 10%, respectively were found to be a suitable mix for PAC. Even though incorporation of GGBS and SF increased the shrinkage, strength and durability were improved. Generally, shrinkage produced by PAC was significantly lower than that of conventional concrete.

## Cement Replacement Materials (CRM) in Concrete - Structville
Jan 20, 2021As can be seen from the study, the optimum partial replacement of cement with silica fume for maximum compressive strength of concrete occurred at 15%. Sakr (2006) reported that at 15% silica fume content, the compressive strength of concrete increased by 23.33% at 7 days, 21.34% at 28 days, 16.50% at 56 days, and 18.00% at 90 days.
