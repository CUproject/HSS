## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

## Iron ore pricing explained - Fastmarkets
Sinter fines and lumps make up the bulk of the seaborne iron ore market, and are the products most frequently traded on a spot basis, so daily pricing is used for the key 62% Fe, 58% Fe and 65% Fe fines, and lump premium references. By contrast, the beneficiated ore segment - comprising pellet and concentrate - is smaller in terms of both

## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3). Quartz dissipates easily, breaking down to fines with little applied stress. Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e. 7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5-6.5), Magnetite (5.5-6), it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble, 1988).

Re-beneficiation of iron ore tailings from the conventional beneficiation plants The hematite ore (Fe 2 O 3) is always associated with limonite & goethite ores, which cannot be attracted by high gauss magnetic separators in the conventional beneficiation plants. Such tailings have 30-50% left-over Fe, which is a waste of natural resources.

Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.
