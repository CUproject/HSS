## Stamp mill celebrates Arizona's gold mining history
Dec 3, 2021This is a stamp mill, a 19th century invention that saved miners from extracting precious minerals by hand, which took far more time and effort. The stamping process — recreated at the Cave Creek Museum's Arizona Gold Mining Experience — was used at the turn of the 20th century across much of Arizona, which has a storied history of mining.

## French Henry mine
In 1894 mining started again, this time under the Claude Mining and Milling company. The new owners installed a 15 stamp stamp mill along the South Ponil River with a 2,700 foot aerial tramway running down French Henry ridge. In 1936 a 50-ton stamp and amalgamation mill was added, and subsequently ran by a man called C.H. Anderson.

## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

the Empire Mine. Hard rock miners had to mill, or crush the quartz ore. They worked stamp mills to pulverize the ore to a powder. Early stamp mills had two to five stamps. Later, banks of forty or more were used. Gold was then separated from this fine powder by the use of mercury, or quicksilver as it was called.
