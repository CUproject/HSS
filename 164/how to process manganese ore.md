manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.

## Manganese Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Santanu Chakraborty, in Treatise on Process Metallurgy: Industrial Processes, 2014. 5.3.7 Manganese Ore. Manganese ore is required in iron making to control the manganese content of the hot metal in the desired range. Unlike other plants, where manganese ore lump is used directly in blast furnace, in VSP, it was proposed to use manganese ore fines in sinter productions.
