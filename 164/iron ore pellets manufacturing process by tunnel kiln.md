## Iron Ore Pelletizing Plant - Iron Ore Pelletizing | Pellet Plant In 
The iron ore pellet production process mainly includes four steps: raw material preparation, mixing, balling, and indurating.  This process is usually carried out in a grate kiln. In the grate kiln, pellets are heated up to a temperature of about °C in the preheating zone, then they finish the induration at roughly °C.

As such, it's important to note that the process described here is a generalized approach subject to many variations. In general, three primary phases occur in iron ore pelletizing: Mixing/Preconditioning

## Applications of Iron Ore Pellets & Iron ore Pelletization Process
Jan 21, 2022Usually, Iron Ore is manufactured and converted into Pellets. These are oval lumps of iron ore that are hardened using fuel. This process of converting iron ore into pellets is known as Pelletization. Iron Ore Pellets are then used in the production of steel. Pellets are usually preferred instead of raw Iron Ore because it allows for maximum

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
It is an agglomerating process of converting iron ore fines into 'uniformed sized iron ore pellets' which can be charged directly into a blast furnace (BF) or into a vertical furnace or rotary kiln normally used for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI). The iron ore pellets are shown in Fig 1.
