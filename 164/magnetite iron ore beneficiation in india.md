In India, magnetic concentration is very effective method for the beneficiation of iron ore, nearly 90% of ores are concentrated by this method (Ryan 1991) (Table 1). Approximately 20-35% of all the unit of iron lost their value by magnetic separation, because hematite ore of iron is weakly magnetic response.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total

Jun 28, 2022The iron minerals in the ore are magnetite and hematite or siderite, mostly fine grains; the gangue minerals are mainly quartz, and some contain more iron silicate. The proportion of magnetite in the ore varies, often increasing gradually from the surface of the deposit to the depths. There are two commonly used beneficiation methods for such ores:
