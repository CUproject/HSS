Within the mineral processing industry, a range of grinding conditions exists which include semiautogenous grinding (SAG), rod milling, and conventional ball milling. Each of these mill environments presents a unique environment for grinding media, requiring the application of specific physical and chemical properties for optimum grinding media performance. The environments are characterized

## effect of grinding media on sag mill performance
Semi autogenous grinding SAG mill liner design The AusIMM used to illustrate and to quantify mill performance and the interaction shell lifters alters grinding ball trajectories and hence the point of which now incorporate slurry effects using smoothed particle increasing mill volume and hence the grinding media when new ball hardness profile and worn shape e .
