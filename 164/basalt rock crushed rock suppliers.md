You would multiply: 20' x 30' x 0.5' (6" = half a foot). The total equals 300 cubic feet. There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, so divide 300 cubic feet by 27 = 11.11 cubic yards.

The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.
