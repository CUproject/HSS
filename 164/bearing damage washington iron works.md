## Bearing Damages | KRW Leipzig
Provided that the bearings are correctly dimensioned and operated, the material fatigue included in this calculation is therefore only the main cause of very few roller bearing damages. The failure of a bearing due to material fatigue is generally very rare and usually triggered by other factors that cause pre-damage to the bearing.
