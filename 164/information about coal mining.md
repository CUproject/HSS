Coal Facts. Coal is critical to our world, through its use in providing much-needed affordable electricity and also in building our societies through its use in steel and cement. 37% of the world's electricity and over 70% of the world's steel is produced using coal. The world still needs coal - not only is coal the affordable choice for

The Coalbrook mining disaster is the worst mining accident in the history of South Africa. The disaster occurred in the Coalbrook coal mine of Clydesdale Colliery on 21 January 1960 at around 19:00 when approximately 900 pillars caved in, almost 180 metres underground. The mine is situated in the Northern Free State, 21 km south west of Vereeniging.

The environmental aspects of mining have received little analysis. U.S. coals vary in moisture content (2 to 40%), sulfur content (0.2 to 8%) and ash content (5 to 40%). The energy content varies from lignite to sub-bituminous to bituminous coal. The ORNL-RFF study looks at two levels of sulfur content (0.7% and 2.1%).

Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.

Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam - although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage.
