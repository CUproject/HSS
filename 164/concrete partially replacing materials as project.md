## Replacement Concrete: Materials and Applications
The minimum depth of concrete removal for replacement concrete should be around 25mm and should extend till all the defective concrete has been removed. In case of a vertical member, the top of the hole should be cut in a 1:3 upward slope from the back toward the face from which the concrete will be placed. This is essential to permit vibration

## Cement Replacement Material - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Concrete is an artificial stone manufactured by mixing together coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water and often other components such as cement replacement materials, e.g., pulverised fuel ash, and chemical admixtures, e.g., superplasticisers. The grading of an aggregate defines the proportions of particles of different size in the aggregate.

ashes replacement. The highest compressive strength was 24.9N/mm2 and 22.4N/mm2 at 56 days for 0% and 10% of CCA (M25) and 24.9N/mm2, 23.9N/mm2 forSDA (M25) respectively. It was concluded that the use of CCA and SDA as a partial replacement for cement in concrete, particularly in plain concrete works and non - load bearing structures, will
