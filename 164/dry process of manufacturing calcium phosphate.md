A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.

We can produce calcium lactate via the reaction of lactic acid with calcium carbonate (or calcium hydroxide). In industrial-scale production, the common production strategy is fermentation of carbohydrates in the presence of calcium carbonate or hydroxide. The major applications of this compound are in medicine; it is used as an antacid.

Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound, a salt with the chemical formula CaCl 2.It is a white crystalline solid at room temperature, and it is highly soluble in water. It can be created by neutralising hydrochloric acid with calcium hydroxide.. Calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a hydrated solid with generic formula CaCl 2 ·nH 2 O, where n = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.

## us patent for manufacturing process of dicalcium phosphate
A process is described for highly efficient recovery of phosphate values from a wide range of phosphate rock including low grade phosphate rock material by leaching with a dilute sulfuric acid and precipitating phosphate values as dicalcium phosphate. Water savings are accomplished in the process by the use of sea water instead of fresh water.
