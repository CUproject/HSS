## The Fundamentals of Frac Sand Logistics - Hi-Crush
In 2012, sand made up about 80% of the proppant market, and in 2017 it reached about 97%. Sand is most commonly used because it is an economical source of large proppant quantities with characteristics suitable for the majority of U.S. well completions. Unconventional wells have caused massive growth in the volume of frac sand being used.
