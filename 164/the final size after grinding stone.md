## Best Practices for Surface Finishing | MoldMaking Technology
Machining usually results in a coarser finish than grinding; therefore, a coarser grit stone should usually be used. For a ground finish, stoning can begin with a finer grit stone. Preliminary stoning may be done with a 240 grit stone to remove final dips, depressions, waves or other imperfections and achieve a flat or properly contoured surface.

Flat stones remained in use both for raw and finish grinding on many of the larger plants until around 1910, and on small plants until 1930. The use of flat stones as the final, fine-grinding stage for both applications was displaced by tube mills, particularly after steel fine-grinding media became available. Roller Mills

Honing, because it uses rectangular grinding stones instead of circular grinding wheels, can correct these irregularities.  A still faster and more accurate method of honing a bore to final size is single-stroke honing. The single-stroke tool is an expandable diamond-plated sleeve on a tapered arbor. The sleeve is expanded only during setup.
