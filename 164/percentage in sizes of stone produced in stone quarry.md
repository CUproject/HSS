Natural stone must be carefully quarried and preferably removed as large blocks. The first step is to take down the "primary block", which is a large dimensioned chunk of rock loosened from the quarry wall. This is most often achieved by drilling, blasting or/or sawing. A primary block can vary in size depending on the stone type, and up to 1000 cubic metres, 2700 tons!
