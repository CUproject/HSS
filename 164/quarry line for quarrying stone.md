Types of Stone Quarrying. Stone is usually quarried in (1) Open pits or shelf quarries, (2) Underground mining, (3) Boulder quarries, and (4) Aggregate quarries. Stone meant for use as cemetery stones, mausoleums, buildings, and bridges is considered "dimension stone," which means the blocks of stone are cut to specific sizes or shapes.

There is a very high waste factor in the quarrying of dimension stone. For some quarries the amount of usable stone is only 15 to 20 percent of that quarried. For this reason an important aspect of quarry planning is the location of the waste or "grout" pile.  In the latter case a line of small-diameter holes only a few centimetres deep
