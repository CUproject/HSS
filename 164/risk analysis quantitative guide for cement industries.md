## Risk Analysis | Process and Types of Risk Analysis with Techniques - EDUCBA
Risk analysis may be classified either as quantitative risk analysis or qualitative risk analysis. Quantitative risk analysis is based on simulation or deterministic methods (i.e., on some data quantities). The variables are primarily based on certain logical assumptions. An example of quantitative risk analysis includes the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Quantitative Risk Analysis by TheSafetyMaster
Nov 9, 2021Quantitative analysis in project risk analysis is a fundamental and basic technique in assessing or determining the probability and potential impact of project risks. It determines the extent of the level of risk in a project. Professional project managers, consultants, and stakeholders must be well-trained for doing quantitative analysis when

## Quantifying risk - Project Management Institute
Through the process of quantitative risk management, project managers can convert the impact of risk on the project into numerical terms, which is often used to determine the cost and time contingencies of the project. This paper provides an overview of quantitative risk assessment methods and a real world example of how QRAs were effectively used on a capital project in the mining industry.
