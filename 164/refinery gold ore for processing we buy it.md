## Process Of Refining Gold | My Gold Guide
This process is known to purify gold to 99.95%. This method got its name from Francis Bowyer Miller, its inventor. In the Miller process, unrefined gold is first melted. Then, chlorine gas is passed through it. The gas turns other metals and impurities into a solid form, making it easy to separate them from gold.

## How the Gold Refining Process Works | Global Bullion
The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

## The Process of Finding and Refining Raw Gold - NYK Daily
The purpose of off-site refining is to expel any remaining impurities from the gold. Off-site refineries achieve this by melting the crude gold then treating it with chloride. Chloride combines with any unwanted minerals or elements and naturally separates from the gold. Refiners expect the gold to be at least 99.5% pure after this process.

The result of this process is 99.5 percent pure gold. The final step is to cast the gold into electrodes or anodes and place them in an electrolytic cell. The refiners will then pass an electric current through the cell. At the end of this process, the gold will be 99.99 percent pure.

You need to pay special attention to the rise of gold prices if you send scrap to refine regularly. When it goes up, your settlements, no matter which refinery you work with, should follow the same patterns and fluctuate like the gold market. If gold is projected to grow in 2022, then the gold refinery prices should go up.

The Soviet ore refinery is a resource processing building in Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2. The Soviet ore refinery was deployed with a War Miner. After harvesting ore, the War Miner would return to the ore refinery and dump it onto a conveyor that carried it into the building. The Soviet ore refinery is more primitive than the Allied equivalent.
