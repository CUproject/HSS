## ICRA - Strong demand growth for Mining & Construction Equipment Industry
The Indian Mining & Construction Equipment (MCE) industry is likely to see a moderation in demand growth, which is expected to fall to 4-6% in the medium term, more particularly during CY2019. The basic reason are the policy paralysis and diversion of liquidity during Central elections, which generally leads to slow progress on projects.
