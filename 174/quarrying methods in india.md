The Coquina Quarry is excavated to more than 60 feet (18 m) beneath sea level. To lessen surface leakage, a moat lined with clay was constructed round the complete quarry. Ground water that leaks into the pit is pumped up into the moat. Many quarries fill with water after desertion and turn into lakes. Further quarries are made into landfills.

In India coal seams with inclination as steep as 1 in 3 have been worked by mechanised opencast mining methods in Karanpura field. Seams at shallow depths which are actively gassy, liable to spontaneous heating or with bad roof should preferably be extracted by quarrying as the mining legislation for underground working of such seams is stringent.
