•From a metallurgy perspective beneficiation relates to processes used to upgrade the mined raw material or "run of mine" (ROM) ore. •The fundamental objective of the application of metallurgy is to produce the materials required for fabrication and manufacturing. In the case of coal the objective is to produce a fuel and/or a reductant.
