## Refinancing Your House? How a "CEMA" Mortgage Can Help
Mar 3, 2021For example, if you have a $200,000 mortgage and are refinancing with a $300,000 loan and live in New York City, you would ordinarily have to pay a tax of $300,000 x 1.8 percent (2.05% minus .25% percent paid by lender), or $5,400. With a CEMA loan, you would only pay the 1.8 percent tax on the difference of $100,000, meaning a tax of just $1,800.

## Design of Screw Pitch for Screw Conveyor: - BlogMech
Sep 13, 2022Design of Screw Conveyor: The size / design of screw conveyor depends on two factors. 1. The capacity of the conveyor. 2. The lump size of the material to be conveyed (Maximum dimensions of the particle) For the transportation and dispensing of bulk materials, screw conveyors are one of the most often used machinery. The size of a screw conveyor must be calculated in numerous projects in order
