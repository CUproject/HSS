##  What Is Coal Preparation?
What Is Coal Preparation? • Coal preparation is the removal of undesirable material from the Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal by employing separation processes which are able to differentiate between the physical and surface properties of the coal and the impurities. Through coal preparation, a uniform product is achieved.

Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.
