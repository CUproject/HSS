## Belt Tensioning Methods for Small Package Conveyors
As shown in the figure below (Figure A), the tension on the belt is accomplished by turning the screw at the end of a conveyor. This pushes the bearing block towards the end of the conveyor, which adds tension to the belt. There is another, identical jack-screw located on the opposite side of the roller.

## Belt Tension - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Belt Tension. Belt tension at steady state can be calculated as:(6.6)Tb=1.37×f×L×g×2×mi+2×mb+mm×cosδ+H×g×mmwhere Tb is the belt tension (N), f is the coefficient of friction, L is the conveyer length in meter divided by two, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81m/s2), mi is the load of idlers within 1m length of conveyer belt (kg), mb is the load of 1m length conveyer belt (kg
