## Continuous Sand Filtration - Brightwork BV
Moving bed (bio) filtration (MBF) is a mode of sand filtration based upon uninterrupted filter operation. Sand cleaning is continuous while the filter is in operation and hence a 24/7 availability of the process is guaranteed. The process features, advantages and applications of MBF are presented below. Three applications of MBF are discussed in more detail on the following subpages

## Continuous flight auger vs bored pilesofy
Continuous flight auger piles combine the advantages of driven piles with the versatility of bored piles. This drilling method allows piles to be excavated in a wide variety of soils - dry or water-logged, loose or cohesive - and also to penetrate through low-capacity, soft-rock formations, loamy clays, limestones and sandstone, etc.

The air scouring is done with low pressure air of 0.35 to 0.4 kg/cm 2 g & generally with 50 cum/m 2 flow rate. Various air scouring methods are adopted. For example air scouring first & followed by water backwash, simultaneous air & water wash. In the case of simultaneous backwash with air separate air grid is provided at the bottom.

Principle of operation. The sand bed of this continuous upflow filter is dirtiest around the feed inlet in the lower part of the filter. The dirty sand is carried from the lower part of the filter through the air lift pump up to the sandwasher in the upper part of the filter. The cleaned sand is then returned to the upper layer of the bed.

The homogeneous sand filter has a 0.9-1 m deep bed of typically 0.85-1.7 mm sand (d 10 =0.9 mm) placed on a 50 mm layer of 4-8 mm or 75 mm of 6.7-13.2 mm gravel. Homogeneous sand of effective size up to 1.3 mm has also been used. The stated size ranges for sand and gravel are generally 5 and 95 percentiles.

## Multimedia (sand) Filtration Calculation - Lenntech
Multimedia (sand) Filtration Calculation. Please fill in the flow. recommended range of Filter Bed Speed is between 10m/h and 30m/h. The above multi-media filtration calculator calculates the diameter of a round multi-media filter (MMF) based on the filter bed speed as input. For industrial water filtration purposes vertical filter bed speeds
