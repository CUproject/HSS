## Challenging the "Crago" double float process II  - ScienceDirect
In the conventional phosphate flotation (Crago) process, 30-40% by weight of the silica present in the feed are floated twice, first by fatty acid, and then by amine. The Crago process is therefore inefficient in terms of collector efficiency. Also, the phosphate mining industry is faced with higher fatty acid prices, lower feed grade, and
