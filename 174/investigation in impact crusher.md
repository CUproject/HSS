## Investigation In Impact Crusher
The impact strength, which is the measurement of toughness like percentage elongation and percentage reduction in area, is highest in martempered and solution heat-treated conditions, higher in as-cast conditions being least in high-temperature tempering.The hardness value from the surface to the core of crusher jaw under investigation. Impact

## Impact Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Impact Crusher Working Principle. Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them. Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on
