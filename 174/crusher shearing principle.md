Working Principle of a Jaw Crusher. A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces.

## Crush Cutting | Score Cutting | Myths vs Facts | Dienes USA
Crush cutting equipment costs less than shear components, is easier to set up for different widths, but delivers a rougher edge cut quality. That is why each application requires subjective analysis by both the converter and end user in order to determine whether this slitting method is the correct one for the application.

The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top. 25/12/2014 The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening.

Attrition is a term applied to the reduction of materials by scrubbing it between two hard surfaces. Reducing it in size and shape. Used with friable or not too abrasive materials. Hammermills operate with close clearances between the hammers and the screen bars, and they reduce by attrition combined with shear and impact reduction.
