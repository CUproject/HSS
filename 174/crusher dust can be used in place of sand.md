When it comes to a healthy and robust lawn or any other plant, compaction is the enemy. When turf is grown in crusher dust, which means that it is growing in rock, it has shallow root growth causing the plant to always be thirsty and reliant on frequent watering. As we know, this has a disastrous result in times of drought and water restrictions.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Crusher Dust Can Be New Type In Place Of Sand
Crusher Dust Can Be New Type In Place Of Sand. The present Investigation has been undertaken to study the effect of blast furnace slag and crusher dust on the mechanical properties of concrete, when coarse aggregates is replaced by blast furnace slag and crusher dust is replaced with fine aggregate in different percentages i.e. 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 .
