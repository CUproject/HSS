## Hammer mills : an engineering overview. What is it ? How it works
The hammer mill design is very robust and is used in many applications, from grain milling to heavy duty requirements such as rock crushing or waste grinding. Hammer mills are part of the impact mill family, which means that the milling effect is obtained thanks to the speed at which particles are impacted, here, by one or several rotors. 2.

## Hammer Mill Crusher & Grinder - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The hammer mill is the best known and by far the most widely used crushing device employing the impact principle of breaking and grinding stone. Thus far we have described machines which do a portion of their work by impact, but the only machine described in which this action plays an important role was the sledging roll type and particularly the Edison roll crusher and in these machines
