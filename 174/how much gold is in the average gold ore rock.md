## Concentration, Grade and Units - Gold Companies Explained
The average gold grade of mined ore in 2009 was 1.8 g/t Au (Schrodde, 2011). In early stage exploration the levels of gold that are significant are much smaller than 1 g/t Au because very small levels of gold may be indicative of a larger body somewhere nearby, even if it was not directly sampled.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

Gold ore is probably one of the most commonly misidentified minerals of all. I probably get at least 2 emails every week from someone asking if they have found gold, but 99.9% of the time, the gold rock that they have found is not actually gold. An important thing to understand about most gold ore is that it isn't shiny at all.

Gold doré bars are the result of removing all non-metal particles out of the gold ore, and consolidating the gold bearing naturally formed alloy into a single chunk.

## Gold | Geoscience Australia
Native gold, R30017. Source: Geoscience Australia. Gold, like iron, copper, lead and tin is a metal. Gold is the only yellow metal and is chemically very stable. It does not readily combine with other substances and, therefore, does not corrode or tarnish. Because of this property, it is almost always found in nature as pure gold.

Now understand this bigger rock weighs (20 pounds plus) so that means there's more than 10 pounds of gold inside that rock. At a 50% average so 10 Troy pounds gives 120 ounces of gold in the rock and assuming it's at $1500 an ounce. We get something around $180,000 for minimum value from that, by multiplying 120 ounces times $1500 an ounce.

Gold has another distinctive quality, which is perhaps most important to the prospector (other than its value) and that is its weight. Gold is extremely dense, one of the heaviest of all metals. The specific gravity of gold is 19.6, meaning that it weighs 19.6 times more than an equal volume or mass of pure water.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
