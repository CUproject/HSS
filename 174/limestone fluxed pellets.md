## Effect of adding limestone on the metallurgical properties of iron ore 
Limestone fluxed pellets are highly porous and therefore very reducible but physically weaker than non-fluxed ones. The CCS distribution (see Fig. 13) is broad and the standard deviation is high for both pellet grades; therefore, the average CCS value alone is not a proper indicator of the mechanical properties of the pellets.

Bokaro Mahila College. The biggest and 1st indigenous Steel Plant of India was set up with Russian Collaboration at Bokaro in Year 1965. The makers of the Steel Plant not only visualised a massive and modern Steel Plant, but also planned a beautiful well laid out city with Schools, Hospitals, Parks, Market, & other requirements of the modern city.

## Basic process of producing basic fluxed pellets for iron-making
A new fluxed pellet for use in iron-making is obtained by mixing and indurating about 1 to about 20%, by weight of the pellet, of ground melt shop slag fines with similarly ground iron ore concentrate, so as to achieve particular ranges of silica content, CaO/SiO 2 ratio, and MgO content. The melt shop slag fines have been considered a waste material, but contain significant slag and metal values.

Condition the mix with steam immediately before it enters the press. You do this by adding steam directly into a horizontal mixing/transport chamber. Conditioning adds heat and moisture to the feed, which softens it and makes it easier to press the pellets. Conditioned meal falls into the press where it is pelleted.

Abstract Pelletization experiments of fluxed iron ore were carried out using Baharia iron ore (in Western desert, Egypt) and Rifai limestone (located east of Cairo). Fluxed pellets containing 10% and 20% limestone were produced in a laboratory balling drum. It was found that the pelletization kinetics were sensitive to the water content of the pellets.

For pellets fluxed with limestone and dolomite the amount of melt phase was found to increase with increasing basicity while the FeO content of the silicate melt decreased. The swelling index of the limestone fluxed pellets reached its maximum at approximately 0.6 basicity which is in good agreement with the observations in Figure 15.23.

## Reducibility and Reduction Swelling Behaviour of Some Iron Ore Pellet
• Main types of pellets Acid Basic Fluxed • Some additives are often used to make better the metallurgical properties (reducibility, softening and melting properties, slag formation) of the iron ore pellets Limestone CaCO3 Magnesite MgCO3 Dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO3 Olivine Mg2SiO4 • In this study, the focus is on limestone as an additive.
