## Coal and its application in the cement production process
Aug 29, 2021According to calculations, a large amount of energy from coal is used to produce cement, of which it takes about 200 kg of coal to produce one ton of cement and about kg of cement to produce one cubic meter of concrete. In addition to being a fuel, industrial coal also contributes to being one of the raw materials involved in the cement

## Cement - Analysis - IEA
In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, the thermal energy intensity of clinker production declines 0.8% per year to a global average of 3.2 GJ/t, and the electricity intensity of cement production falls by 1.9% per year to 84 kWh/t. This excludes additional energy required for emissions reductions technologies such as CCUS.

## Energy Use - Cement
In total Australian cement producers used around 21 petajoules of thermal energy, up 3 per cent year-on-year and down 23 per cent since (see below). Of this 61 per cent came from coal, 21 per cent from natural gas, 3 per cent from diesel oil and other fuels. The remaining 15 per cent was derived from alternative fuels (such as wood
