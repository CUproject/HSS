## How M sand is manufactured? The Process Everybody Wants to Know
Apr 2, 2022M sand is also called manufactured sand or Robo sand. It is manufactured by crushing hard stones, mainly granite or rocks, to fine particles in a factory or quarry. It is mixed with cement/bitumen and water to form a concrete or mortar mix. Different grades of M sand are manufactured based on their granule thickness.

The manufactured sand has required gradation of fines, physical properties such as shape, smooth surface textures and consistency which makes it the best sand suitable for construction. These physical properties of sand provides greater strength to the concrete by reducing segregation, bleeding, honeycombing, voids and capillary.

## Artificial Sand Manufacturing Process - Eastman Rock Crusher
Artificial sand is produced by reducing larger pieces of aggregate into sand-sized aggregate particles. Manufactured sand can be manufactured to be a certain grain size that the buyer chooses, while natural sand can be a mix of coarse and fine grains. Manufactured sand tends to be more angular and flaky due to the crushing process.
