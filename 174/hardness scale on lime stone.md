## The hardness of natural stone - Kallisthos
In general, limestones have a hardness of 3 or 4 on the Mohs scale. Basalt, however, is a much harder stone. It reaches a hardness of at least 6, sometimes 7 Mohs, and so sturdy metal equipment is needed to work with it. Another stone in the same range in terms of hardness is andesite. Last but not least, there is granite.
