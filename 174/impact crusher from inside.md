HSI Crushers Vs.VSI Crushers. In an HSI crusher, material is crushed from the impact of fast-moving bars attached to the rotor. This material is continually crushed by the impact of the bars until it becomes fine enough to be shaped into a high-quality end product. VSI crushers operate quite differently from HSI crushers.
