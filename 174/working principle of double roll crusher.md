## The Working Principle Of Double Roll Crusher
Working Principle of Double roll crusher. A roll crusher crushes using compression, with two rolls rotating about a shaft, towards the gap between the rolls. The gap between the rolls is set to the size of product desired, with the realization that the largest feed particle can only be 4 times the gap dimension.
