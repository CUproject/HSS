## What's the Difference Between SAG Mill and Ball Mill
The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's

SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%. The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter, powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor. A SAG mill with a 44' (13.4m) diameter and a power of 35 MW (47,000 HP) has been designed. Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles.

## Calculating Electric Power | Ohm's Law | Electronics Textbook
Learn the Power Formula. We've seen the formula for determining the power in an electric circuit: by multiplying the voltage in "volts" by the current in "amps" we arrive at an answer in "watts." Let's apply this to a circuit example: How to Use Ohm's Law to Determine Current. In the above circuit, we know we have a battery voltage of 18 volts and a lamp resistance of 3 Ω.

## power calculation formula of sag mill
power calculation formula of sag mill. SAG Mill Grinding Circuit Design. Jun 06, 2016· Traditionally, many engineers approached SAG circuit design as a division of the total power between the SAG circuit and ball-mill circuit, often at an arbitrary power split. If done without due consideration to ore characteristics, benchmarks against
