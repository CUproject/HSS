## Calcite mining and processing plant
The input of such crushers is relatively wider and the output products are coarser in size. Example - Jaw crusher, Gyratory crusher. b) Secondary crusher- The crushed rocks from primary crusher are sent to secondary crusher for further size reduction. Example - Cone crusher, reduction gyratory crusher, spring rolls, disk crushers etc.

## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers | Agg-Net
Jaw crushers are mainly used in primary crushing stages and are rarely used for secondary crushing. As a compression crusher, this type of machine generally produces the coarsest material because it breaks the rock along its natural lines of weakness. Jaw crushers are an excellent primary stage solution to prepare rock for subsequent processing

## Primary and secondary crushers - Welding Alloys
Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.
