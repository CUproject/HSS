How are sand dunes formed? The conditions required for sand dune formation are: a large supply of sand; a large flat beach; time for the sand to dry, so an extensive tidal range is needed; an onshore wind (wind blowing from the sea to the land) for sand to be transported to the back of the beach

Dunes commonly begin as piles of sand accumulated in the lee of beach debris such as piles of seaweed (especially Sargassum ), clumps of salt marsh straw, and a host of human refuse (fishing nets, bottles, timbers) (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3). Beach debris slows down the wind or blocks it, causing sand to accumulate in the wind "shadow" of the object.

## Sand Dunes: Meaning and Its Types | Geology - Your Article Library
Sand dunes are accumulations or mounds or heaps of sand deposited by wind. When the wind that is blowing sand along the ground encounters an obstruction such as a boulder or a bush, its forward energy is decreased and some of the sand comes to rest. The resulting heap of sand enlarges the obstruction and a dune begins to grow.
