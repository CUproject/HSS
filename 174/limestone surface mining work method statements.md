## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Glory hole mining is a method where the mineral is excavated in small open pits but is transported to the surface through underground excavations and transport system. ADVERTISEMENTS: Nearly 70% of the mineral production in the world comes by opencast mining and in India this method of mining accounts for nearly 75% of our mineral output.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Surface Mining Methods
Regardless of the necessity or economic advantage, all surface solution methods share two common characteristics: (1) ore is mined in the usual way and then stockpiled; and, (2) an aqueous solution is applied to the top of the ore stock which reacts chemically with the metal of interest from which the resulting metal salt solution is channelled through the stock pile for collection and processing.

Open-pit Mining. Open-pit mining is a method in which an ore is removed by digging a pit in the ground, and is used to remove copper, gold, iron, as well as non-metallic minerals. It is normally used when the rock layer above the ore is too weak to allow underground tunnels. In this technique, circular steps, or 'benches', are dug around
