## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

The grinding mill is one of the important mining machines. When grinding materials, the output of grinding mill will be affected by many factors, mainly by the particle size of the finished product, the hardness of the material, the humidity of the material, the composition of the material, the viscosity of the material, the working efficiency of the supporting measures of the equipment, etc.

## Ceramic Ball Mill For Grinding Materials - FTM Machinery
The grinding ceramic ball mill uses different ball mill ceramic liner types according to production needs to meet different needs. The finess of ceramic ball mills depend on the grinding time. The electro-hydraulic machine is auto-coupled and decompressed to reduce the starting current. Its structure is divided into integral and independent.
