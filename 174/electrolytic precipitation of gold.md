## electrolytic precipitation of gold
Gold parting is the separating of gold from silver. Gold and silver are often extracted from the .. Soon after, in the 1870s, Electrolytic refining of gold was developed, the Wohlwill process, to deal with the . This acid dissolved the gold to a soluble chloride and the silver was attacked and precipitated as an insoluble chloride.

Abstract. Cyanidation has been used to extract gold (and silver) from ores, concentrates, and calcines since the 1890s. The precipitation of gold from cyanide solutions by zinc cementation was patented in 1884 and was applied industrially as early as the cyanidation process.

## Describe Electrolytic Refining and Uses of Gold - QS Study
Electrolytic refining. Electrolytic refining method is used when very pure gold is required. The impure gold is made the anode while a thin sheet of pure gold acts as the cathode. The electrolyte consists of a solution of auric chloride (AuCl 3) acidified with 10-12% HCl. On passing current pure gold gets deposited on the cathode.

A new and effective electrochemical process for the extraction of gold, silver and other precious metals from low-yield ores containing relatively large quantities of other non-precious metals wherein a novel electrolytic dissolution cell is provided for the controlled production and efficient utilization of chlorine as a solubilizing agent for the removal of the precious metals from the ore

## Gold Precipitation Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
GOLD PRECIPITATION. Five methods of precipitating gold and silver from cyanide solutions have been used: aluminum, charcoal, sodium sulphide, zinc, and electrolytic. The first and third were specially developed for the silver ores of Cobalt, Ontario; charcoal has been used in Australia,- with some possibility of revival; and zinc, either as
