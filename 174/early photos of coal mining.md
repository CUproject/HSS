Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

## The lives of coal miners in the early 20th century | Britannica
Over the years, there have been many improvements in the mining industry. Women now work alongside men, and, though still dangerous, the work isn't as deadly as it used to be. In 1917, 2,696 coal mining deaths were recorded. In 2017, the number was 15. Despite that progress, though, mining is still very hard work.

## Western Pennsylvania Coalfields
Over 15 billion tons of coal have been taken from Pennsylvania since mining began around 1760 (near Pittsburgh). The peak year of production was 1917, when 277 million tons were extracted. PA was the No. 1 coal mining state in the U.S.A. until West Virginia surpassed it in 1930. In 1992 Pennsylvania produced only 65 million tons of coal, but

## Automated early game coal mining, no electricity. : r/factorio - reddit
Easy way to get a decent amount of coal early game. My favorite approach to this is to have 4 miners in a circle offloading into a chest each and having a inserter move coal from a chest to an adjacent miner. The benefit is that you get more coal faster and you have chests so the capacity is unbounded.

Coal mining. For several years in the middle of the 20th century, Sangamon County was a leader among Illinois counties in the production of bituminous coal. Coal was discovered in Illinois as early as 1673, when French explorers Marquette and Joliet noted outcroppings of coal along the banks of the Illinois River between Ottawa and Starved Rock.

Dec 18, 2020The early mines used the so-called "room-and-pillar" method, a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane, creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars. Mines relied on manual labor to cut the coal at the working face and the coal was hauled from the mine by horse and wagon.

## The Hazards of 19th Century Coal Mining | eHISTORY
There were two big engineering problems in mining coal underground: A system to drain water from the mine. A system to ventilate the mine and to provide fresh air to the miners. A special problem in coal mines was the methane (a gas) that sometimes accompanied coal, and which could--and too often did--catch fire and explode. Andrew Roy was one

Bell pit mining was one of the early methods of underground mining. The name comes from the shape that the mine forms. A long narrow shaft is dug down until it reaches the coal seam. Once it reaches the seam, the coal is then mined laterally along the seam either side of the shaft, creating the bell shape. The coal would then be wound up to the
