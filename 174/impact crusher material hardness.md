## VSI Crusher Vertical Shaft Impactor - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
The Vertical Shaft Impactors or VSI Crusher are one type of impact crushers, which offer higher reduction ratios at a lower energy consumption. These impactors. can be considered as a 'stone pump' operating like a centrifugal pump. The material is fed through the centre of the rotor, where it is accelerated to high speed before being discharged through openings in the rotor periphery.
