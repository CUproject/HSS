"Also, Chinese ore contains about 15-20% manganese, while South African ore contains 38 -50% manganese. So Chinese operations have to mine a much larger amount of ore, to produce the same volume of manganese." South Africa can potentially fill the emerging gap in global manganese production, he says.
