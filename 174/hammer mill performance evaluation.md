## evaluation of hammer mill
Development and Performance Evaluation of a Bone . A hammer mill which combined both impact and shearing action of hammers with a pneumatic conveying and clarifying action was designed and fabricated for efficient milling of cassava into fine powder nwaigwe et al a hammer mill having a grinding component and a sieving component was developed for milling grains

## performance evaluation of hammer mill
Performance evaluation of a locally fabricated hammer mill was also done Best operating settings with maximum energy efficiency and most uniform particle size were determined and found at hammer thickness of 5 mm hammer tip speed of 83 57 m s-1 and screen hole diameter of 2 16 mm
