## Bad EGR Valve: Common Symptoms and Testing Procedure
Typically, the EGR valve's location is on the engine's intake manifold. A tube connects the valve to the exhaust manifold. When the conditions are correct, the EGR valve opens, allowing exhaust gases to enter the engine, where they are burned as part of the normal combustion process. There are many different EGR system designs in use today.
