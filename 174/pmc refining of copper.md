## Copper promotion of myocardial regeneration - PMC - PubMed Central (PMC)
Copper-induced angiogenesis thus reconstructs the conduit for the transduction of tissue injury signaling, recruitment of tissue repair materials such as stem cells, and the homing of stem cells, leading to the promotion of myocardial regeneration. Thus, copper promotes myocardial regeneration through reactivation of HIF-1-regulated

## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

The Old Copper Complex in North America has been radiometrically dated to 9500 BP—i.e., about 7480 BCE—making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world. The earliest evidence of cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at Çayönü Tepesi in eastern Anatolia, which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE.

##  12.3 Primary Copper Smelting - US EPA
Fire refining and electrolytic refining are used to purify blister copper even further. In fire refining, blister copper is usually mixed with flux and charged into the furnace, which is maintained at 1100°C (2010°F). Air is blown through the molten mixture to oxidize the copper and any remaining impurities. The impurities are removed as slag.

Viewed. 5. In refining copper, an aqueous solution of copper (II) sulphate is electrolyzed, using impure copper as the anode and pure copper as the cathode. At the anode, metal impurities higher than copper in the electrochemical series such as zinc, iron and lead are oxidized first, then copper loses its electrons to form copper (II) ions.

In refining copper, the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities, most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.
