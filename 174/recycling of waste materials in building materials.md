## Sustainable Management of Construction and Demolition Materials
Jul 9, 2022By 2003, almost 170 million tons of building-related C&D materials were generated. In 2003, nonresidential sources accounted for 61 percent of that amount. The largest building sector that generated C&D materials was nonresidential demolition followed by the residential renovation. For more on C&D, visit the web page on C&D Material-Specific Data.

## Recycling residential building materials: opportunities and limitations
Aug 23, 2022Reusing materials from existing buildings (or 'urban mining') has been proposed as a means to reduce demolition waste, raw material consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This study models the opportunities for urban mining in the Netherlands under practical constraints, up to the year 2050. The researchers find a limited potential for recycled materials to meet demand and reduce emissions.

Tip 1. Build It Back Into the New Building. The smartest way to recycle construction waste is to integrate it back into the new building or the new building site. Some of this may happen naturally. In remodeling projects, walls are not necessarily demolished. They may simply be redecorated, moved, or reconfigured.

Although recycling is not best for some plastics (such as those that are soiled), the material can still serve a useful purpose if used in a waste-to-energy system (WTE). This process involves the conversion and recovery of the energy value in the waste material through the application of high temperature, controlled combustion.

## 10 Surprising Building Materials Made Entirely Out of Waste Products
3) Bottle Bricks. The recycling of plastic and glass bottles into different products is not anything new. However, very few people know that bottles can also be used as building materials.

## Waste and Recycled Textiles as Reinforcements of Building Materials
Other researches focused on the use of recycled textile fibers in composites, as reinforcing materials [ 15 ], i.e., used carpet waste as a soil reinforcement material. The reinforcing fibrous strips were 5 × 5 mm and lengths of 5-45 mm. They were added to the soil in concentrations from 0.4 to 1.2%.
