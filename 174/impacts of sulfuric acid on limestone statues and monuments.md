## How does acid precipitation affect marble and limestone buildings? - USGS
When sulfurous, sulfuric, and nitric acids in polluted air react with the calcite in marble and limestone, the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues, we see roughened surfaces, removal of material, and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive.

How does acid rain affect rocks and human structures? Acid rain damages buildings and structures because it dissolves the stone or corrodes the metal that is exposed to the weather. Before people became aware of the problems that acid rain caused they often used metals limestone and marble as building materials exposed to rain and fog.

Best Answer. Copy. The main component of limestone is CaCO3 (calcium carbonate). Assuming this is what is referred to, the reaction is as follows. CaCO3 + H2SO4 --> CaSO4 (aq) + H2O + CO2. Wiki User.

However, sheltered areas on limestone and marble buildings and monuments show blackened crusts that have spalled (peeled) off in some places, revealing crumbling stone beneath. This black crust is primarily composed of gypsum, a mineral that forms from the reaction between calcite, water, and sulfuric acid.
