## Will Clay Pigeons Kill Wild Hogs? - The Body Training
The standard or traditional clay pigeon, however, is not biodegradable. When made with a petroleum pitch, they will not decompose and simply just break into smaller pieces. To avoid polluting the environment and keep it safe for animals, many companies have made clay pigeons out of non-toxic and non-hazardous materials that will eventually

## Is "It" Biodegradable? Easy Cheat Sheet for Popular Products
Traditional clay pigeons are non-biodegradable due to their chemical composition. However, some manufacturers specialize in modern, biodegradable clay pigeons.
