The pulp is fed into the second cell of each bank and a sulphide rougher concentrate is produced from cells, 2, 3 and 4 and returned to the first cell for cleaning. This cleaned sulphide copper concentrate is pumped by 3″ x 3″ DRL Pumps to the main sulphide cleaner concentrate pump box and thence to thickeners.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing (2022)
Copper process : The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most profitable ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (Cu 2 S). These minerals are intense from crushed ores to the level of 10 to 15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.
