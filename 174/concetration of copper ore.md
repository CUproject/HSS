## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.

Copper Ore is smelted into Copper Bars at a forge, requiring a mining skill of 1 or more. Copper Bars are used in the production of many items, including Bronze Bars . Copper Ore can be prospected (consuming 5 ore) with a Jewelcrafting skill of 20 or more, resulting in: On average, slightly more than one gem is recovered per 5 ore consumed.

## 139 to increase the concentration of copper in an ore
See Page 1. 139.To increase the concentration of copper in an ore, it must be crushed to a very fine size and then beneficiated to remove the gangue minerals. Because sulfide minerals are hydrophobic and most silicate minerals (gangue) are hydrophilic a process calledfroth flotationis used to concentrate the chalcopyrite.

Ores are solid materials that can be used to produce pure metals. Concentration, dressing, or benefaction of ores is extracting undesirable particles from ore. There are various steps to it. The variations in physical characteristics of the existing metal complex and that of the gangue are used to separate the needed material from the ore.

## Concentration of Ores: Hydraulic Washing, Froth Flotation with Examples
Concentration of Ores. An ore of a metal is an impure source, this means other than the metal it consists of many other impurities such as sand, grit, clay, rocks etc. These impurities are collectively known as gangue. Gangue is generally commercial valueless and we must separate it from the ore. This entire process is the concentration of ores

The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method. Concentration of Ore: The ore is crushed into a fine powder and a suspension is created in water. To this are added, Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.

## metallurgy: | Infoplease
When an ore has a low percentage of the desired metal, a method of physical concentration must be used before the extraction process begins. In one such method, the ore is crushed and placed in a machine where, by shaking, the heavier particles  Another method is the flotation process, used commonly for copper sulfide ores. In certain cases
