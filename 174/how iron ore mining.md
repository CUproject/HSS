Mining iron ore. Iron ore is an ore always in demand, due to its use in producing iron and steel bars via Smithing. There are many locations to mine iron ore, but the Mining Guild features several advantages; a trio set of iron ore rocks that are extremely close to a deposit box, an invisible +7 boost to mining, a 50% reduced ore respawn timer

Iron ore is a mineral block found underground. It is a source of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Deepslate iron ore is a variant of iron ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs. Iron ore itself can be obtained by mining it with a stone pickaxe or higher enchanted with Silk Touch. When mined without Silk Touch, iron ore drops raw iron. It is affected by the Fortune

Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3).

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.
