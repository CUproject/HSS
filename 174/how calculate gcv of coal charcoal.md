## calculate gcv of coal charcoal
The energy value of coal, or fuel content, is the amount of potential energy it contains that can be converted into heat. This value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal and where C is the mass percent of carbon, H is the mass percent of hydrogen, O is the mass percent of oxygen, and S is the mass

## Moisture in Coal, Coal Analysis, Kentucky Geological Survey, University 
Moisture content is an important parameter in coal analysis. It is needed for determining the calorific (heating) value and handling properties of a coal. The moisture value given for a proximate analysis is the moisture measured as mass lost from a sample under specified conditions after heating in a moisture oven to 104 to 110°C (ASTM method
