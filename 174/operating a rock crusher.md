## Enhancing safety around crushers : Pit & Quarry
Safety on a crusher starts with the person feeding the plant. The person feeding the plant needs to be trained on best practices specific to the crusher they are working with. An operator may have years of experience operating and loading a cone crusher, but that doesn't translate into experience loading and operating a jaw crusher.

The jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a "V"-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. This is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other. Compression is created by forcing the rock against the stationary plate in the crushing chamber as shown in Fig

All rock crushers can be classified as falling into two main groups. Compressive crushers that press the material until it breaks, and impact crushers using the principle of quick impacts to crush the material. Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, and cone operate according to the compression principle.

To optimize operating costs and improve the product shape it is recommended that cone crushers are always be choke fed, meaning that the cavity should be as full of rock material as possible. This can be easily achieved by using a stockpile or a silo to regulate the inevitable fluctuation of feed material flow.

If you find the crusher operating in a crushing force over-load condition (ring movement) or a power over-load condition (excessive power), open the crusher setting slightly, but try to stay choke fed. The benefit of staying choke fed is that there will still be rock-on-rock crushing and grinding taking place in the crushing cavity.
