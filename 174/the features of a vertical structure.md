A vertical organization is the traditional business model of a CEO underpinned by managers and departments. It is a trickle-down concept of corporate power and responsibility that is bureaucratic and departmental in nature. Large corporations have historically favored the vertical organization, though things have changed in the last few decades.

A vertical organization structure is one that relies on managers to command and control their employees' work. A business owner is typically at the top of a vertical chain of command. There are advantages and disadvantages to a vertical structure. The main advantage is that there are clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

## What Is a Horizontal Organizational Structure? - Smart Capital Mind
Sep 2, 2022Jan Fletcher. Horizontal organizational structure is a form of managing workers in which decision-making is spread among workers along horizontal lines, as opposed to a hierarchical or pyramidal management structure. The philosophy behind this form of management is that a collaborative model improves morale, productivity and creativity.

Vertical woodland structure refers to the differences found at different heights in the woodland. Woodland is usually referred to as having four distinct layer. The Ground layer refers to the plants growing on the floor of the woodland. Towards the edge of the woodland this may well be very green and made up of grasses, mosses, lichens and fungi.

## What is the structure of the tropical rainforest?
The forest floor is usually dark and damp. It contains a layer of rotting leaves and dead animals called litter. This decomposes rapidly (within 6 weeks) to form a thin humus, rich in nutrients. Below the rich top soil the soil lacks nutrients. This is because nutrients are rapidly absorbed by vegetation.
