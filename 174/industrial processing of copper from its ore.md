## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is

## processing copper from copper ore 」
Sep 26, 2019Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw, mined state into a purified form for use in many industries. Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.

## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## Aluminium Ore: Extraction of Aluminium - VEDANTU
Bauxite is the most common Aluminium Ore and Hall - Heroult process is the major industrial process for the extraction of Aluminium from its oxide alumina. Nevertheless, Aluminium has a tendency to get along or combine with the elements that are common while its compounds are found in all common rocks and more like clay, slate, shale, schist

## Copper ore processing technology development and research in China 
There are two main copper ore processing methods, flotation and hydrometallurgical process. In terms of process improvement, the current research mainly focuses on the research of fast flotation, early removal of waste, reduction of overgrinding and undergrinding, etc. At the same time, the joint process is also the focus of current research.
