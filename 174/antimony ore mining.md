## antimony ore mining
Antimony Smelting - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy. The history of the antimony industry of China dates back to 1897 when the Tai Shing Co. was formed, under contract with the Hunan Bureau of Mines, for the smelting of the ore to crude; and in 1908 the Wah Chang Mining & Smelting Co. was formed for the smelting and refining of the ore and crude to regulus.

Antimony, a toxic metalloid similar to arsenic, is present at variable levels in most gold-bearing rocks.
