One place does limestone, the other crushed concrete. The crushed concrete will run my about $5/ton less. With an estimated need of 45-50 tons, thats a pretty significant savings.

## Flagstone: what to use, sand, cement, or gravel?
Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.

## Restoring Limestone, Removing Mildew and Mold
For interior limestone, it may be necessary to dry limestone. Use a heat gun and gently dry the tiles. Check the moisture periodically by using a damp meter, and stop applying heat once the stone is dry all the way through. This is less necessary for exterior limestone, though cleaning should be saved for a warm and sunny day for proper drying.
