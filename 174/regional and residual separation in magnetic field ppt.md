## Regional-residual separation of potential field: An example from 
We present a regional-residual separation procedure for potential field data (gravity or magnetic) based on the integration of least-squares polynomial, power density spectrum and Upward continuation techniques. The proposed procedure is composed by 6 fundamental steps: 1) gridding of the total potential field; 2) least-squares polynomial approximation to calculate polynomial regionals; 3

## Separation of regional and residual magnetic field data
The separation is achieved by inverting the observed magnetic data from a large area to construct a regional susceptibility distribution. The magnetic field produced by the regional susceptibility model is then used as the regional field, and the residual data are obtained by simple subtraction. The advantages of this method of separation are

##  Gravity regional residual separationgeo
Regional field - regional and residual anomalies. Bouguer anomaly fields are often characterized by a broad, gently varying, regional anomaly on which superimposed higher wave number local anomaly occurs. Usually in gravity surveying it is the local anomalies that are the prime interest and . the first step is to remove the regional field.

## computation scheme based on field attenuation rate for improving 
To further improve the accuracy of regional-residual separation of potential field data set, this paper presents a novel computation scheme based on different attenuation rate of the fields induced from deep and shallow sources respectively. For the new scheme, the observations are first upward continued to a plane above it to get an updated field.

## New Perspective in Regional and Residual Separation of Gravity and 
Separation between Regional and Residual anomaly in Gravity and Magnetic data processing is very important to get the best result in geological interpretation. Several method were used to solve this problem like upward continuation and polynomial fitting.
