## Iron Oxide Red - All You Need to Know | African Pegmatite
The classic example of red iron oxide is as an inclusion pigment in the production of clay ceramics, such as tiles and bricks. Inclusion pigments are when a pigment is added to a clay before it has been fired into the ceramic form, such pigments do not dissolve in the media (i.e. the clay, water and other materials), but are dispersed evenly

## Iron oxide
Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen.Several iron oxides are recognized. All are black magnetic solids. Often they are nonstoichiometric. Oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.. Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes.
