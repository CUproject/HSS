## determining the wear rate on balls in a ball mill
The theory of the calculation of the size distribution of the equilibrium mixture of balls in a ball mill is developed. The differential equation is solved for wear laws of the form wear rate per ball â r 2 + Î where r is ball radius. Î = 0 gives the Bond wear law and Î = 1 gives the Davis wear law. Methods of determining Î are illustrated.
