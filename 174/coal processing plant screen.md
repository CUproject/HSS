## Selection Tips for Vibrating Screens | Coal Age
In coal preparation, screening machines serve two purposes: sizing and media recovery. Oftentimes, the initial screening is performed by a scalping screen located outside the plant. This prevents the screens inside the plant from becoming overloaded.  "Many coal-processing plants today are still using 2- x 4-ft profile in a bolt-down

The coal delivered from the mine that reports to the coal preparation plant is called run-of-mine, or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground
