Crushed stone did not become a staple in construction until after WW2 for a simple reason: The equipment did not exist to crush or move stone efficiently. Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed.

There are four basic mechanical methods to reduce a material - by compression, impact, attrition, or shear - and most crushers employ a combination of all these crushing methods. Compression. Crushers that employ the forces of compression squeeze material between two surfaces, one stationary and the other moving, in order to achieve size reduction.
