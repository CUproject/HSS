The final drying and sorting steps take place in the dry plant and are critical to frac sand quality. Drying prepares the sand grains for size screening, and makes it easier and less costly to transport and use. Rotary drums are commonly used to provide uniform, high-volume drying. Large rotary dryers can process 300 tons of sand per hour.
