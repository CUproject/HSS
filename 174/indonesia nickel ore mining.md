## Indonesia plays hardball with its nickel | East Asia Forum
Mar 30, 2021With the largest reserves of nickel deposits in the world, Indonesia is no longer content to simply export its raw ore. Indonesia wants to take a central position in the value-added links in the EV supply chain — from mining the ore, to refining it, to manufacturing the batteries and eventually to building the cars. And because Indonesia

## Nickel - Vale
In Indonesia, post-mining land reclamation efforts have been recognized by the local government for four consecutive years. A revegetation program involves re-contouring mined land, restoring topsoil, and planting grasses, legumes and canopy trees to create a microclimate suitable for the reintroduction of native plant species.
