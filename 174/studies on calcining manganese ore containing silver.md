## Pre-treatment for Conventional Cyanidation for Silver Recovering From 
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION. The present invention discloses a treatment for recovering silver from ores containing occluded silver, predominantly pyrolusite, which includes a pre-treatment of the manganese-argentiferous ore with sulfur dioxide produced by roasting elemental sulfur, generating manganese sulphate, and pregnant solution with more than 90% silver recovery.

## Leaching Method for Recovering Silver & Manganese
Assuming a homogeneous distribution of the silver throughout the ores, from 1 to 5 pct additional silver should be recovered if the manganese leaching with SO2 is allowed to be completed. Ore CO-1 (fig. 2) has little silver in the manganese mineralization, as evidenced by the 2 pct of the silver coleached with the manganese (table 3).

## Cobalt mineral colorzkibetonowe-opole.pl
Cobalt normally happens in nickel bearing laterites and nickel-copper sulfide stores and, accordingly, is frequently separated as a by-result of nickel and copper. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. Silver-colored cobalt metal is brittle, has a high melting point.

Iron ore, bauxite, manganese ore are some examples. Metallic minerals may be ferrous or non-ferrous. Ferrous minerals like iron ore, manganese and chromites contain iron. A non-ferrous mineral does not contain iron but may contain some other metal such as gold, silver, copper or lead. Non-metallic minerals do not contain metals.

## Effect of Manganese on Silver Leaching - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In favor of this theory may be mentioned the fact that: in the case of manganese ores it commonly happens that the ore in the upper levels is more refractory than that in the lower, though containing the same percentage of manganese. An oxidizing roast applied to any silver ore usually renders the bulk of the silver insoluble in cyanide.

Manganese oxides are one of the most important groups of materials in energy storage science. In order to fully leverage their application potential, precise control of their properties such as particle size, surface area and Mn x + oxidation state is required. Here, Mn 3 O 4 and Mn 5 O 8 nanoparticles as well as mesoporous α-Mn 2 O 3 particles were synthesized by calcination of Mn(II

## Process for treating sulfide ores containing gold and/or silver and as 
This invention relates to a process for treating a granular sulfide ore containing as a noble metal gold, silver or gold and silver and as an accompanying base metal at least iron.  For calcining purposes, granular ore is supplied via line 1. The ore, which may also be an ore concentrate, usually has grain sizes in the range from 0.01 to 4
