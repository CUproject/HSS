## Actual Concrete Mix Ratios For 3000, 3500, 4000, and 4500 psi concrete
Rounded off it's basically a 1 : 3 : 3 mix ratio. If I break the weights down per yard of concrete it comes to: 1. Cement = 510.75 pounds. 2. Stone = 1658.75 pounds. 3. Sand = 1496.25 pounds. A sack or "bag" of cement weighs 94 pounds so this tells us a 3000 psi concrete mix is also equal to a 5.5 sack mix of concrete.

Procedure To Calculate Cement Bags In 1 Cubic Meter: To achieve 1 cum output, we need 1/0.67 = 1.49 say 1.50 cum dry mix. Volume of cement = (cement/cement+sand+aggregate) × Total material. Weight of 1 bag cement = 50 kg. = 6.25 bags. Note: You can use the same formula for calculating cement for other nominal mixes.

Multiply your area figure by the depth of gravel that you wish to use, ensuring your measurement is also in feet. If your depth is in inches, divide it by 12 first. You now have a cubic feet volume figure. To convert to cubic yards, divide by 27. To work out the weight in tons, multiply your volume figure by the density of the gravel in tons/yd³.

## Concrete Mix Ratio and How to Mix Concrete | DIY Doctor
Concrete Mix Ratio for a C20 and C20P (Portland) Mix. The proportions of materials for a C20 and C20P (P = Portland cement) concrete mix are: 1 part cement; 2 parts fine aggregate (sand) 4 parts coarse aggregate; If you are using premixed ballast, then: 6 parts pre mixed ballast; 1 part cement

## How to Calculate the Amount of Fill for a Trench | Hunker
Apr 22, 2022Convert the volume in cubic feet to cubic yards. Soil, concrete, and other fill materials are usually sold by the cubic yard. There are 27 cubic feet in 1 cubic yard, so divide the value in cubic feet by 27 to convert to cubic yards. In the above example, the conversion would be 138/27 = 5.1 cubic yards.

## How to do I calculate how much sand and cement needed for bedding 
How Many Bags of cement sand and gravel are in 1 cubic meter for M20 Concrete (1:1.5:3) A shrinking factor or safety factor of 1.54 to 1.57 can be used. You can choose any value between 1.54 to 1.57. Total cement required = 1/5.5 x 1.57 =0.285 cum =0.285/0.0348 = 8.20 bags of cement.
