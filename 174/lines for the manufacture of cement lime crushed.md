CEMENT MANUFACTURE. The cement-making process can be divided into two basic steps: Clinker (the main constituent of cement) is first made in a kiln with gas up to 2000°C, which heats raw materials such as limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (e.g. clay) to 1,450°C.
