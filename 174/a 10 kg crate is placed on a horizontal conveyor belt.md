Three 4-kg packages A, B, and C are placed on a conveyor belt that is at rest. Between the belt and both packages A and C the coefficients of friction are µ s = 0.30 and µ k = 0.20; between package B and the belt the coefficients are µs = 0.10 and µk = 0.08. The packages are placed on the belt so that they are in contact with each other and

## SOLVED:A 10 -kg crate is placed on a horizontal conveyor belt moving 
A 10 -kg crate is placed on a horizontal conveyor belt moving with a constant speed. The crate does not slip. If the coefficients of friction between the crate and the belt are $mu mathrm{s}=0.50 mu_{mathrm{s}}=0.50$ and $mu mathrm{k}=0.30, mu_{mathrm{k}}=0.30$, what is the frictional force exerted on the crate?
