For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

The first stage of size reduction of hard and large lumps of run-of-mine (ROM) ore is to crush and reduce their size. Softer ores, like placer deposits of tin, gold, mineral sands etc. do not require such treatment. Large scale crushing operations are generally performed by mechanically operated equipment like jaw crushers, gyratory crusher and roll crushers.

## The Introduction of Jaw Crusher Design Principle
The Introduction of Jaw Crusher Design Principle. Jaw Crushers are designed to impact on a rock particle placed between a fixed and a moving plate (jaw). The faces of the plates are made of hardened steel. Both plates could be flat or the fixed plate flat and the moving plate convex. The surfaces of both plates could be plain or corrugated.
