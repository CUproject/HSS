To put simply: yes, cake flour must be sifted before using it. Cake flour is so fine that it clumps together very easily. While large clumps can be broken up with a spoon or spatula, small clumps are tenacious and will show up as lumps of uncooked flour in your finished cake if you are not careful.

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.

Typically, mill tailings range from sand to silt-clay in particle size (40 to 90 percent passing a 0.075 mm (No. 200) sieve), depending on the degree of processing needed to recover the ore. The basic mineral processing techniques involved in the milling or concentrating of ore are crushing, then separation of the ore from the impurities.

Yes, you run an experiment to see what percentage of foreign objects you run through the sieve are captured. You could run 100 (or more) metal objects of the correct sizes (the hazard size range) with some product and try to recover them out the other side with a magnet or metal detector. Or just count them, I suppose.
