## What Is the Difference Between BA, BSc, and BBA?
Feb 23, 2022The main difference between the three lies in the focus of each program. Firstly, a BA program is more generalized compared to a BSc program. A BA and a BSc program have courses that fulfill universal education requirements, i.e., English (language) and writing, mathematics, natural and social sciences, history, etc.

## College Degree in 24 hrs. 100% Legal System - Instant
The college degree granting process is achieved thru the clever use of LEGAL LOOPHOLES. We are often asked what this means and the best definition, that neatly encapsulates the concept, is that an institution is legally formed and operating in such a way that it makes the granting of a degree legal, whereas this would otherwise be illegal.

The BSc degree is primarily a stepping stone to further study. An additional year of study could lead to a teaching qualification or a more specialised Honours qualification. Because the Faculty actively encourages research, many students go on to study for Master of Science and Doctoral degrees.
