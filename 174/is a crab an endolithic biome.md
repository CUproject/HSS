The Ostreobium genome has 10,663 predicted protein-coding genes and shows adaptations for life in low and variable light conditions and other stressors in the endolithic environment. This alga presents a rich repertoire of light-harvesting complex proteins but lacks many genes for photoprotection and photoreceptors.

A biome / Àà b a…™ o ä m / is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in, and can be found over a range of continents. Spanning continents, biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate. "Biome" is a broader term than "habitat"; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats.

Sep 11, 2022The endolithic (meaning "within rock") biome is a biome located below the surface of the Earth. Other examples of biomes include savanna, desert, and jungle. The endolithic biome consists entirely of microbes living in tiny pores and cracks of rocks, and extends down to at least 3 km (9,600 feet) below the surface.

Introduction. Anthropogenic biomes, also known as "anthromes" or "human biomes", describe the terrestrial biosphere in its contemporary, human-altered form using global ecosystem units defined by patterns of sustained direct human interaction.

Crabs are invertebrates (animals without a backbone). Their exoskeleton protects them from predators and provides support for their bodies. They have flattened bodies, two feeler antennae, and

## Crab: Is this creature a vertebrate or an invertebrate animal?
The crabs are also arthropods, which means that they are endowed with an external skeleton ( exoskeleton) and articulated appendages. The exoskeleton is partially covered by a shell composed by chitin, and it is also mineralized with calcium carbonate. The appendage of the invertebrates animals are the equals of the limbs of invertebrates.

## Crab
Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin, and armed with a pair of chelae (claws). Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4 m (13 ft). Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances - such as king crabs and porcelain crabs - are not true crabs

## What Are Crab Niches?
What Are Crab Niches? Niches refer to the various adaptations that allow crabs to survive in their environments, and they are used to describe the specific habitats that crabs inhabit, such as below rocks and along shorelines. Niches that help crabs survive include physical adaptations such as large claws. Crabs vary widely in appearance and size.

Biome Classification Schemes Biome classification schemes seek to define biomes using climatic measurements. Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s there was a significant push to understand the relationships between these measurements and properties of ecosystem energetics because such discoveries would enable the prediction of rates of energy capture and transfer among components within ecosystems.

Hermit crabs are one of the two main groups of crabs: the other being true crabs. Most hermit crabs inhabit the marine realm but others live a predominantly terrestrial existence. Hermit crabs differ from true crabs in that their abdominal section, the part of the body that includes the tail, is not protected by a hard exoskeleton.
