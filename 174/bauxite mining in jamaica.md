## 60 years of bauxite mining in Jamaica - Part 1
ALTHOUGH I have written about the Jamaican bauxite and aluminium industry in three books and numerous articles, I think it is appropriate to repeat some of what I have written to mark the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the commercial mining of the ore. On June 5, 1952, the first shipment was made by Reynolds Jamaica Mines from its port in

This has caused mining costs to become a more important factor than location near a smelter. Environmental Issues caused by bauxite mining. Due to the methods of mining (open cast), the end result of mining on the landscape is very unsightly. Jamaican regulations ensure that the land is reclaimed when mining in an area is complete.

Bauxite or 'red dirt', the raw material used in the production of aluminium, has been extracted in Jamaica by open-cast mining since 1952. In the 1960s Jamaica was the leading producer in the world and the industry expanded over the years to include four large refineries which process most of the raw bauxite into alumina before it is exported.

## Bauxite Jamaica | A Jamaica Experience
Bauxite Ore from mining in Jamaica. The Bayer Process is the main industrial way of refining bauxite to produce aluminum. Bauxite is the most important ore in aluminum but it has only thirty (30) to fifty-four (54) percent aluminum oxide. The remaining mixtures to produce aluminum are titanium dioxide, silica, and other iron oxides.
