## Capping Layer - CoGripedia - CoGri Group Ltd
A capping layer is laid over a poor quality subgrade, ensuring that it will provide stiffer resistance to the loads from the structure above. It also reduces the chance of differential settlement in the slab by supporting it more homogeneously than an unimproved subgrade, which may contain 'soft spots'. Another way in which a capping layer

## Methods of Recycling Concrete | Uses | Benefits - CivilDigital
Recycled concrete can be used as an efficient building material, if it is crushed properly and kept free of unwanted materials and contaminants. A process called Rubberization can be achieved through recycled concrete. In this process, the pavement concrete can be broken down in its own place and used as a base layer for the new pavement.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

It's recycling! Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.

##  Crushed Concrete and Brick
- Crushed concrete and crushed brick have comparable properties to conventional materials used for capping layers in the railway structure. WHERE ARE THEY USED? Recycled concrete and brick aggregates have been used to produce concrete, mortar, and brick tiles, and are suitable for pipe backfilling. Additionally, they can be re-used as aggregates in

##  Road Pavement Design Guide - Kent County Council
The design of a scheme should enable the maximum use to be made of the material available on the site for capping layer, sub-base or roadbase by using a permitted binder. In addition, the use of construction materials from sources that maximise the amount of recycled materials is strongly encouraged.
