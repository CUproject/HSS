## Vibrating Screen Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The simplest Vibrating Screen Working Principle can be explained using the single deck screen and put it onto an inclined frame. The frame is mounted on springs.  Screen capacity is dependent on the type, available area, and cleanliness of the screen and screenability of the aggregate. Below is a general guide for determining screen capacity
