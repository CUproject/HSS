## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers | Agg-Net
Cone and gyratory crushers. Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are also compression-type machines that crush material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The output is controlled by the setting between the two pieces of steel. Though the chamber is round in shape, the moving piece of steel is not meant to rotate.

## Crushers and Their Types - IspatGuru
Crushers are also classified by their method of mechanically transmitted fracturing energy to the material. Jaw, gyratory and roll crushers work by applying compressive forces while impact crushers such as hammer crusher apply high speed impact force to accomplish fracturing. There are several types of crushers which are used in various industries.
