Quartzite. Quartzite is an extremely dense material and does not etch when exposed to acidic foods, making it a popular choice for countertops, especially for those looking for an alternate to typical granite. Due to its density, quartzite takes a nice polish, and is also available in honed and brushed finishes.

Quartzite is rock composed of quartz sand grains. Silicified sandstone, or 'orthoquartzite', consists of sand grains fused together with silica. It resembles hardened sugar and some varieties have excellent flaking qualities. Metamorphosed sandstone, or 'metaquartzite', is formed when the sandstone is altered by heat and pressure

## Quartzite - Granite Diamond Blades
Quartzite is a porous material. This means that raw quartzite will absorb water readily. The absorption rate of quartzite varies from one stone to the next. Some quartzite is more porous than others and thus absorbs more quickly. Think about the implications of that. A stone that absorbs liquid is at a higher risk of staining.

## Quartzite Rock Formation, Uses, Properties and Occurrence - Geology Science
Uses of Rock. Quartzite is use for making bricks and other strong building materials. It is also growing in popularity as a decorative stone, and has a limited use as crushed stone. As it is so hard, quartzite is not quarried as much as softer stone, and tends to be taken from the surface rather than underground.
