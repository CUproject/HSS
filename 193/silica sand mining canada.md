## Stop Silica Sand Mining in MB - Manitoba Energy Justice Coalition
Silica sand mining is the process of mining to extract silica sands to be used for glass, solar panels and fracking. Very little of Manitoba's silica sand is of a pure enough quality for glass and solar panels. Cleaning sand to reach that quality is a very polluting process as it creates acid drainage.

To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.
