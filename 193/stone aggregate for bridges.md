A) fine aggregate:- the aggregate which are usually passes or sieve through sieve of 4.75 mm size. That is known as fine aggregate and it is normally is sand or crushed stone having size less than 9.5 mm in diameter. Different types of fine aggregates and their size. 1) stone dust -0.5 mm to 5 mm 2) coarse sand-0.5 to 2 mm

Aggregate piers or stone columns are often the most cost-effective option when also considering remove-and-replace or deep foundations. The installation process is fast, often resulting in 40 to 60 piers installed per shift. Typical bearing pressures using aggregate piers are in the range of 4,000 pounds per square foot (psf) to 6,000 psf, but

Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

## Aggregate stone
Aug 20, 2022Aggregate is the component of a composite material that resists compressive stress and provides bulk to the composite material. For efficient filling, aggregate should be much smaller than the finished item, but have a wide variety of sizes. For example, the particles of stone used to make concrete typically include both sand and gravel; Aggregate or crushed stone.
