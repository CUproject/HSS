## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

Production and Price of Manganese. Raw materials prices change daily. They are primarily driven by supply, demand and energy prices. In 2019, prices of pure Manganese were at around 17 $/kg. Manganese is most commonly produced by the reduction of the oxide with sodium, magnesium or aluminium. Alternatively it can be produced by electrolysis.

An aluminium alloy (or aluminum alloy; see spelling differences) is an alloy in which aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin, nickel and zinc.There are two principal classifications, namely casting alloys and wrought alloys, both of which are further subdivided into the categories heat-treatable and non-heat-treatable.

## Aluminum Processing_Development, Introduction, Melting and casting, process
Can be extruded into a ribbed tube with a diameter of 800 mm. Building profiles are extruded products developed in the 1960s and account for more than 35% of the total extruded products, of which 80% are used as door and window frames. Almost all building profiles use aluminum-magnesium silicon alloys (LD30 and LD31).

## Aluminum Casting Processes - Metal Casting Institutue
Vertical Low Pressure Die Casting (LPDC) is performed using a vertical process that injects molten aluminum against gravity, in an upward direction. In a typical process used to produce aluminum road wheels, steering knuckles or control arms, the die is filled with metal from a pressurized furnace, with an an inert gas at about 0.7 Bar (10 psi).
