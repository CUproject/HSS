## Coal Mine Dust Lung Disease. New Lessons from an Old Exposure 
The number of coal miners in the United States declined steadily after World War II as the industry became more mechanized.  A recent study from 2,476 underground U.S. coal miners showed that small radiographic opacities were approximately equally  The spectrum of lung disease associated with coal mine dust exposure is broader than

The years of dust exposure were based on the time they worked in the dust exposure sites.

## Coal dust
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverizing of coal.Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.. Grinding coal to dust before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning and makes the coal easier to handle.

## Occupational skin and lung disease in coalfield communities
In the 1950s, the hazards of coal mining were due more to physical work conditions than exposure to chemicals. Miners were exposed to trauma, coal and stone dust, sweating and humidity. They sustained injuries from falling stones or coal blocks, or from working in awkward places (Hodgson, 1955). Coal tattooing, also known as 'colliers

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

## Respirable coal mine dust in underground mines, United States, 1982 
Methods: Respirable dust and quartz data collected and analyzed by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) were summarized by year, coal mining occupation, and geographical area. The older (before August 2016) 2.0 mg/m 3 respirable dust MSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) was used across all years for comparative purposes.
