## Cost-Efficient Beneficiation of Coal by ROMJIGs and BATAC Jigs
Jigs represent one of the earliest types of machinery employed in mineral separation. Their adaptation to process coal established jigs as the most popular and efficient method of coal cleaning for over a century until the arrival of dense medium process. Increased demand for more and more cost-efficient methods of beneficiation lead to a review of the jigging process.

Firstly, it involves the preparation and liberation, of the valuable minerals from waste minerals and secondly, the separation these values into two or more products, called concentrates. The term separation in this case is synonymous with concentration.
