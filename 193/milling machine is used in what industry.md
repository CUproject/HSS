## Milling Machine Types and Uses - Ricardo & Barbosa
Aug 20, 2022Milling Machine. Milling machines are used mainly for shaping and cutting solid materials such as metal, wood, plastics or even brass. These machines differs from a lathe in that the tool head itself rotates at high speed whereas with a lathe the part itself that is being worked on rotates. This sort of machinery varies greatly in terms of cost

## Machining 101: What is a Milling Machine and How is it Used?
There are three types of CNC milling machines. The 3-axis milling machine. This milling machine consists of a vertical and a horizontal spindle. The cutter is vertical to the table and the table can be positioned in different ways. The 4-axis milling machine. The only difference for the 4-axis milling machine is that a rotary table is added.
