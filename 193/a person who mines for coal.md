## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.

My mother had two brothers that died in separate, coal mine accidents in the 1920s. The large mines were well known and easy to see the associated buildings, but most private mines were seldom seen, by most people. Many small mines were worked by one to 4 or 5 men, and were usually located out behind the barn or house.

The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

May 6, 20212. Fires. One of the most devastating calamities that could happen in a coal mine is a fire or an explosion. The fires can be caused by short-circuits in the electrical equipment or mechanical faults in the machines used. Since coal is already a very combustible material, the effects of a fire inside the mine will be especially devastating.

## Miner
A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, chalk, clay, or other minerals from the earth through mining.There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock. In a broader sense, a "miner" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.
