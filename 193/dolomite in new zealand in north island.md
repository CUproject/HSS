Green for the rolling hills with lush grass, and blue for the ocean and sky. Overall, you could describe North Island's landscape as sweet and lovely, while the inhospitable volcanic areas are fascinating and rough. In the South Island, the landscape is more dramatic. Tall mountains capped with snow, deep green fjords and emerald-blue lakes.
