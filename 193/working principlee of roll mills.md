## Rolling Process: Definition, Working, Rolling Mills, Advantages 
The advantages of Rolling process are as follows. By rolling, uniform dimensions of the components can be obtained. It uses the same tool in the sense, the same rollers are responsible for the production of various components. Close tolerance is possible for the components in the rolling. high-speed production takes place in the rolling.
