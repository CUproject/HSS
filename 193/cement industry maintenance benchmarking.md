The difference between the benchmark price and the actual price allowed us to quantify some aspects of the detriment in cement. 2. To establish our benchmark price, we have derived a competitive supply curve of cement.

The Cement Sustainability Initiative Background Cement is one of the most widely used substances on the planet. Each year, nearly three tons of concrete (containing 10-15% cement) are consumed for each man, woman and child. Making cement is an energy and resource intensive process with both local and global impacts.
