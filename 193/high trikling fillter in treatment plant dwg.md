This process is known as sloughing. A set­tling tank following the trickling filter removes the detached bacteria film and some suspended matter. Handling and disposal of sludge from biological wastewater treatment plants is an important problem and represents about half the cost of most sewage treat­ment plants.

With the growth of Madison, this plant became overloaded and was replaced in 1914 with the Burke Plant on Madison's north side, which is credited as being the first trickling filter plant in history of the United States. As the city continued growing, it became apparent that an additional sewage treatment plant was needed.

High Rate Filters . Extremely high treatment rates can be achieved by using high rate filters thus minimising the site footprint. High rate filters are loaded at rates of 1.0 kg BOD/m³/d up to 5.0kg BOD/m³/d. They are normally designed to reduce the BOD loads by between 50% to 70%. The energy input is less than 0,2 Kwh per kg reduction in BOD.

EFFECT OF HIGH pH ON TRICKLING FILTER PERFORMANCE  By C. Richard Walter Associate, Hauen and Sawyer Engineers, New York, N. 7. During 1956 and 1957 an extensive pilot-plant investigation was conducted at the North Buffalo Creek sewage treatment plant in Greensboro, N. C. The wastes at this plant consisted of a mixture of about 60 per cent normal

## Trickling Filter for High Efficiency Treatment of Dairy Sewage
Zylka et al [229] used a trickling biofilter for the treatment of dairy wastewater and reported removal efficiencies of 87.3%, 78.3% without circulation and 27.9% and 95.2%, 85.5% and 42.0% with
