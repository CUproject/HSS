Dry process cement production kiln is the typical kiln type during the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. It is a big step for haft kiln. Because of its less than 1% water content dust raw materials, it reduces the most needed heat for evaporating water. So, it needs less time than wet process cement production.

The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded onto dumpers

Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
