## The Purpose of Stone or Gravel Ballast on a Flat Commercial or 
It is very important to note that the amount of gravel being applied to a commercial roof must be precise—it depends on the specific roofing spec being used and the building type. Too much gravel can result in a structural issue due to weight. Generally, the weight for a gravel-coated roof must be within 10-25 pounds per square foot.
