## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.  The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores.  A-grade copper cathode is of 99.99% copper in sheets that are 1 cm thick,

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
