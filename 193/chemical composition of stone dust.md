## Composition of Mars
The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic.

## Coal Dust: What Is It, And Why Is It Dangerous?
The finer the particles, the more dangerous they are. Tiny invisible bits of coal can embed themselves in the lungs. Long term exposure can also exacerbate the adverse health effects of coal dust exposure. Other factors that can influence the seriousness of coal dust exposure include the specific chemical composition and physical properties of the dust particles.
