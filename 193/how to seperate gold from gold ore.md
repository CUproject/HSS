Refractory Gold. The last type of gold deposit is called refractory gold, and it is the most difficult type to extract. It can be defined as any ore that responds poorly to a conventional gravity-cyanidation process with examples including copper porphyry, complex sulfides, arsenopyrite and lead-zinc associations.

Set the gold ore and a small quantity of lead in a cupel. Place the cupel in a blast furnace. Heat the mixture until the lead and gold ore liquefy. The blast furnace batters the cupel with hot air. The lead combines with other metals and forms oxide compounds that separate from the gold. This process works best with small quantities of gold ore.

Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

In one, the ground ore is put into a tank containing a weak cyanide solution and zinc is added. The zinc causes a chemical reaction which separates the gold from the ore. The gold is then removed from the solution with a filter press. For the carbon-in-pulp method, the ground ore is mixed with water before cyanide is added.

## How To Separate Gold From Other Metals - Realonomics
Separate the gold from unwanted rocks and minerals using one of several methods. You can mix the gold ore with sodium cyanide which will attach itself to the gold and separate other elements such as zinc. Or pan the gold manually in water to separate gold from the gravel and sand in a stream.
