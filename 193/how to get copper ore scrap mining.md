## What are thering-in
Not least for this reason, the light metal often prevails over copper. With all the advantages that come with the use of aluminium,  Calcined illite or kaolin clay in combination with salt cake from the aluminium scrap recycling industry after alkali activation gives lightweight material from kg/m3.

## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? - ThoughtCo
The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
