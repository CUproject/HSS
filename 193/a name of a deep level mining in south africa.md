Most of this ore lies far below the surface in so-called deep level mines. In essence this means that despite new technologies, mining still relies heavily on people to extract ore. Mining has played an integral part in the development of South Africa since the first diamonds were found in the Orange River in 1867.

What made South African mining viable was a new technique using cyanidation called the MacArthur Forrest process patented in 1887. By 1898 South African gold output had expanded to 118 tons (3.8 million oz), making it the world's leading producer, and after the interruption of the Boer War it soared to 280 tons (9 million oz) by 1913.
