## Sand and hardening methods in sand casting process
The chemical hardening in sand casting is mainly for: 1）Self-hardening: when adding sand, add binder and hardener. In this way, the sand mold or core will harden by itself after it is made. 2）Gas mist hardening: no hardener is added during sand mixing. After modeling or core making, gaseous hardener or atomized liquid hardener is blown in.
