## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Both batch type and drum type plants have variations in them that allow addition of RAP (Reclaimed asphalt pavement). The components of a standard asphalt batch mix plant are: Cold aggregate feeder bins to meter and supply the aggregate to the dryer drum. Conveyor to take the cold aggregates from the feeder and supply the same to the dryer drum.

For the production of an asphalt concrete mix, a blend of aggregates must be used such that the combined aggregate gradation will fall within the control points. False Gradations that violated the restricted zone performed differently to or worse than the mixes having gradations passing outside the restricted zone.

Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 4.75m. The usual range is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in diameter. Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 9.55mm in diameter. Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm. A larger size, 40mm, is more common in mass concrete.

An infinite number of mixes can be produced based on the job's specifications. The aggregates then come out onto the conveyer, and go into the dryer to be mixed.

Asphalt concrete is a combination of two primary ingredients: (i) aggregate and (ii) asphalt cement. Typically, the aggregate constitutes 90-95% (w/w) of the total mixture and the asphalt cement (asphalt binder) constitutes 5-10% (w/w) of the total mixture to form the asphalt concrete.
