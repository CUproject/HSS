## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

## Electrochemical Grinding: Definition, Parts or Construction, Working 
The working principle of electrochemical grinding is When a metal surface is acted upon with an electrolyte under a high current, the metal surface gets oxidized to form an oxide layer (corrosive layer). This layer is removed with the action of a flowing electrolyte and rotating grinding wheel.  Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working

The production capacity of the grinding machine is not only determined by the specifications of the ball mill itself, but also affected by the nature of the ground material and the type of grouped equipment. There is no clear theoretical formula for calculating the processing capacity of the grinding machine.
