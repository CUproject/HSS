## Process control challenges and opportunities in mineral processing
The mineral content can double in a matter of minutes, changing the flow characteristics dramatically. The processes are complex, with many circulating loads. The operator not only has to think of what is coming, but also what is coming back. Grinding typically has two recirculating streams and flotation can have as many as 10.

## Even allocation of slurry flow by distributor - Grinding 
Slurry material ground in a SAG mill feeds two ball mills in the grinding circuit. Which means one pipeline divides into two pipes through distributor (similar to cyclone pack head). Mostly, distributor could not allocate the slurry flow evenly, so the solid in slurry is likely to be more for ball mill 1 and less for ball mill 2, vice versa.

The whole mill classification process is composed of mill and classifier. And the grinding sections must be determined by technical and economic comparison according to specific conditions. In practice, most mineral processing plant adopt one or two grinding classification process, and less adopt three or more grinding classification process.

The Autogenous/Semi-autogenous Grinding Mills are in most cases used as primary crushers. AG Crushers use the ore exclusively as their grinding media. In case the hardness and the abrasiveness of the Ore is not suitable enough to carry out the grinding process, steel balls are added in-order to assist the process; these are called SAG Crusher.
