5 days agoCopper has been a building block of civilisation for over 10,000 years. Copper was the first metal to be smelted, the first to be cast in a mould and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, which kickstarted the Bronze Age. #TM1 #Copper #Mining . 22 Sep 2022 08:45:00

## Mining in Namibia
Mining is the biggest contributor to Namibia's economy in terms of revenue. It accounts for 25% of the country's income. Its contribution to the gross domestic product (10.4% in 2009, 8.5% in 2010, 9.5% in 2011, 12.3% in 2012, 13.2% in 2013, 11.6% in 2014) is also very important and makes it one of the largest economic sectors of the country. Namibia produces diamonds, uranium, copper

Oct 7, 2021Approximately 80% of the carbon emissions generated in copper production originate from copper concentrate production, while the share of concentrate treatment to metallic copper is about 20%. Both process steps can be optimized by selecting the right type of technology for the best energy efficiency and minimized carbon dioxide emissions.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.
