## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

The 300-MW units accounts for 56% (164 sets); the 600-MW units accounts for 36% (104 sets) and 1000-MW units

## coal to ammonia plants
In coal-based ammonia plants, 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from fuel burning and 75 percent from the use of coal as feedstock. 3. Ammonia Schematic .

## Ammonia Staffing and Training at Coal Plants | Oversight.gov
Anhydrous ammonia is hazardous when inhaled, ingested, or when it comes in contact with the eyes, skin, or mucous membranes. Based on safety risks associated with the handling of ammonia, we initiated an evaluation to determine the adequacy of staffing and training of ammonia operations at coal plants. Based on our review of the training
