## Solvay process
The Solvay process or ammonia-soda process is the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash, Na 2 CO 3).The ammonia-soda process was developed into its modern form by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay during the 1860s. The ingredients for this are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from quarries).

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate with the occasional presence of magnesium. Most limestone is biochemical in origin meaning the calcium carbonate in the stone originated from shelled oceanic creatures. Limestone can also be chemical in origin as is the case with travertine.

## process of formation of limestone
Limestone is a source of calcium carbonate and is heated to convert the calcium carbonate into calcium oxide. This process is generally carried out in large rotary kilns or vertical shaft kilns where high temperature is required. Quicklime is produced in the calcination process, which can be crushed depending on it's use.

## Limestone - Formation, Composition, Types and Uses | Earth Eclipse
Limestone, or calcium carbonate, is the common rock found throughout the world. Oldest and perhaps slightly overlooked, limestone is very much part of our everyday life.  Mostly it's due to the algal and bacterial metabolism as the process involves high consumption of carbon dioxide, resulting in saturation of calcium carbonate.
