##  Under-mining health? Local impacts of iron ore mining in India
A central tenet of research on the environmental impacts of mining has been that because mines occupy a relatively small land area (when compared, for example, to other land uses like forestry or agriculture), the effects of mining on the environment will be localized (Bridge, 2004).

What are the environmental impacts of iron ore mining? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.
