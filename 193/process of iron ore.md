## How iron is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used 
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.  The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In
