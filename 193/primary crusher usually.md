## Primary Crusher For Gold-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
Feb 26, 2016 The term "primary crusher," by definition, might embrace any type and size of crushing machine. The term implies that at least two stages of crushing are involved, but in many cases the machine which performs the function of initial crusher is the only crusher in the plant.  PE series jaw crusher is usually used as primary

The size and type of the primary crusher should be coordinated with the type of stone, drilling and blasting patterns, and the size of the loading machine.  Tertiary and quaternary crushers are usually cone crushers, although some applications can call for vertical-shaft impact crushers in these stages.

Jaw crusher is used as primary crusher. It uses compressive force for breaking the material. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher. Reduction ratio is usually 6:1. The jaw crusher is consisting of two vertical jaws installed to a V form, where the top of the jaws are further away from each other than the bottom.
