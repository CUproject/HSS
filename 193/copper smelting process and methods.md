## Decarbonizing copper smelting: a reliable method for carbon footprint 
Oct 7, 2021In 2020, the world's primary and secondary copper production was about 24 Mtpa. Today, the demand of copper is growing much faster than the supply. The rapid increase of electrified transportation and industrial production, not to mention the new transmission capacity that we are going to need to power it all, are impacting the demand of copper.

## Aluminium smelting plantring-in
Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide, alumina, generally by the Hall-Héroult process. Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery. This is an electrolytic process, so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electric power; smelters tend to be located close to large power stations, often.

A copper smelting process is disclosed in which copper concentrate is smelted in a furnace to produce purified copper. Flue gas discharged from the furnace is treated to produce sulfuric acid. Furthermore, waste liquid discharged during the production of sulfuric acid is treated to produce gypsum, and the gypsum thus produced is recycled to the furnace as a flux.

## Copper: smelting, producing and classification-Metalpedia
According to the above, the hydrometallurgical method is relatively advantageous, but the scope of its applications is more limited, so not all the smelting of copper ore can adopt this technique. As technology has improved over recent years, more and more countries have applied the technique in copper ore smelting, including the US, Chile

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The process yields concentrates containing roughly 30% copper, which are sequentially fed to a smelter, a furnace in which most of the some iron and sulfur are removed, then to a converter or converting furnace, where most of the remaining iron and other impurities are removed. (Depending on the type of smelting and converting furnace used, as
