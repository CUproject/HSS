Glacial erratics are rocks transported by glaciers, sometimes for hundreds of miles, and then left behind when the glacier melts. The rocks come in a variety of sizes, from a pebble to a large boulder, and the company was fortunate enough to have the full range of sizes, with the largest being 20 feet tall and 20-ton boulders.

## Rock Boulder Blasting with Explosive
The system is very flexible and many explosive and initiating systems can be used as mentioned previously. For snakeholing, about 1 lb of explosive per cubic foot of rock opposite the charge is needed. When boulder blasting in crushers, less explosive should be used in that the boulder only needs to be cracked or jarred.

Rock base, including Crushed Stone #57 and Base Rock #3, generally costs around $0.65 per square foot, while pea gravel can be found for $0.60 on average. Jersey Shore gravel can cost around $1.80 per square foot, but if you live outside the American northeast, the delivery costs may be prohibitive.

## Three reasons for oversized rocks in the primary crusher feed
The presence of oversized boulders in the feed is readily apparent since the throughput immediately decreases and typically causes blockages in the crusher cavity. These blockages can damage the crusher and take time to clear, resulting in a serious bottleneck for the entire process. To prevent this type of bottleneck, one key element that

## Safe and sound: Crusher safety : Pit & Quarry
Rock breakers are a useful tool to keep oversized rocks from reaching the crusher, too. "It's very practical to have a rock breaker right next to the primary crusher," says Ilkka Somero, Metso's product manager for jaw crushers. "Often, you don't even need to break the rocks. It's enough to pull or push the rocks a little bit.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
