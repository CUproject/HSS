## Copper mining in the United States
Copper mining in the United States has been a major industry since the rise of the northern Michigan copper district in the 1840s. In 2017 the United States produced 1.27 million metric tonnes of copper, worth $8 billion, making it the world's fourth largest copper producer, after Chile, China, and Peru.Copper was produced from 23 mines in the US. Top copper producing states in 2014 were (in

The U.S. coal economy underwent significant changes during the late twentieth century in terms of where and how coal was produced. Overall production increased after 1960 in eastern coal mines, with another jump occurring in western mines after 1970. Mining techniques also shifted from underground to surface mining.

The early decades of the 19th Century saw the foundation of the Electrical Age and thereafter the demand for copper increased tremendously. Britain was the major producer for much of the 19th Century but new mines were opened up in U.S.A., Chile, and later in Africa, until in 1911 the world's output of smelted copper for the first time exceeded

## what equipment is used in copper mining
Blasting and grinding equipment are used to accomplish this task. Open pit mining is a technique used to extract copper ore near the earth's surface. Open pit mining is the most widely used technique of mining copper today. It is accomplished by creating and using benches or terraces to gradually reach deeper under the earth's surface.

Copper mining technology improved over the years since the mine opened in 1846. Mining at Quincy began with men using drills powered by hand and black powder (gunpowder). By the 20th century, a single man could operate a drill by using air pressure, explosives, electric locomotive hauling tools, and steam-powered tools.
