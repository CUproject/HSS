## Estimate Jaw Crusher Capacity - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
From Allis-Chalmers' Superior Primary and Secondary Crushers. ° Actual required depends on stone hardness, reduction ratio, and so on. If a 60-in. gyratory crusher is to process material from a quarry where a shovel loads the raw material, the shovel would probably have to have a dipper capacity of at least 5 cu yd to be compatible.
