## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Several methods/techniques such as jigging, washing, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are being used to enhance the iron percentage in the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. Iron ore is normally beneficiated utilizing the

## Understanding Pellets and Pellet Plant Operations - IspatGuru
The process of enriching taconite ore involved grinding the ore to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore (i.e., an ore beneficiation process). The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles, as small as 0.1 mm or less, which are not suitable for sintering. This issue led to the development of the pelletizing process.

## Lead Zinc Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
1 Lead-zinc sulfide ore 1. Beneficiation process of lead-zinc sulfide ore: The main constituent minerals of lead sulphide ore are galena and sphalerite, all of which are primary ore. Galena has good floatability. In most lead-zinc mines, zinc is higher than lead. Most of the lead-zinc sulfide mine uses preferential flotation technology
