## Weight Capacity of Vibration Machines
The rule of thumb is that whatever maximum weight you need the machine to handle, add about 100 lbs to that number, to calculate the weight capacity specification your vibration machine needs to have. As an example, if you need to exercise with up to 250 lbs of weight (which could be your body weight), then you would want the machine to have a

## A Rule of Thumb for Vibration (Velocity) Limits for Plant  - Fauske
Vibration velocity is the derivate of acceleration and the integral value of displacement. Hence, it lies midway between displacement and acceleration and, thus, covers a broader central frequency range. Piping vibrations typically occur in a more central frequency range i.e. 10 to 1000 Hz, which makes vibration velocity an attractive parameter.

A passing plant worker bumping a feeder or placing a cup of coffee on it can cause isolated, short-duration weight disturbances. Most loss-in-weight feeders are programmed to recognize and ignore a brief disturbance. They quickly determine if they should compensate for any resulting excess or shortfall in discharge.

## Vibrating Pan Feeder| Assembly and Working Principle
This vibrating pan feeder has two types: suspended type and vertical type. Inertial drives can adjust the feeding amount steplessly. Can also be configured with frequency converter rate converter. Feeding size: 0-500 mm Capacity: 0-850 t/h Applicable materials: granite, marble, basalt, limestone, river pebble, copper ore, iron ore, coal, etc.

## The Proper Use of Vibrators - Precast
Another general rule of thumb is to allow the vibrator to sink under its own weight and then remove the vibrator at a rate of about 3 seconds per vertical foot (300 mm). Concrete should move to fill the hole left by the vibrator; otherwise briefly reinserting the vibrator nearby should solve the problem.

## Understanding Vibration and Imbalance in Industrial Fans
See Figure 1. Vibration occurs during fan operation and may have many causes, one of which would be imbalance. Other causes of vibration would include mechanical looseness, coupling misalignment, defective bearings, insufficient flatness of bearing mounting surfaces, rotor cracks, driver vibration and v-belt slippage.

## Parts Feeding: The Black Art of Tooling Feeder Bowls
Feeder bowl noise was a concern recently at TRW Inc.'s air bag assembly plant in Queen Creek, AZ. The bowl was approximately 30 inches in diameter and constructed from stainless steel that ranged in thickness from 0.08 to 0.125 inch. When it was running, the bowl produced an average noise level of 101 decibels.
