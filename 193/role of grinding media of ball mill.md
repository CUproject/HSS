Effect of Balls Hardness on Rate of Grinding Tests by Coghill and Devaney show that the hardness of the balls has some effect upon the rate of grinding in mill. These results are plotted in Fig. 6.8a and it is seen that, both for dolomite and chert, there is an increase in the rate of grinding with increasing hardness of ball.
