## Testing of pneumatic flotation in iron ore processing
It is well recognized that machine type and machine characteristics play vital roles in the successful application of froth flotation in mineral processing. Since the early 1900s, a multitude of machine designs have been and are still being introduced in an attempt to improve flotation efficiency. Machines based on mechanical agitation have been the most dominant in industrial practice

##  Bridging Theory And Practice In Iron Ore Flotation - Hacettepe
practice of iron ore flotation have been reviewed extensively (Houot, 1983; Iwasaki, 1983; Nummela and Iwasaki, 1986). Due to an excess capacity in the world at present, the flotation processing of low-grade hematitic iron ores is no longer an attractive target. A major interest has
