## Theory and Practice of Sintering of Iron ore - IspatGuru
The process of sintering is a thermal operation involving melting and assimilation reactions. The first stage of the sintering process is the formation of the melt which involves the reaction between fine iron ore particles and fluxes. The initial melt is generated from adhering fines during heating via reaction between iron ore and fluxes.

## Sintering Process Of Iron Ore
Mar 09, 2013 Sintering is a thermal process (carried out at 1300 deg C to 1400 deg C) by which a mixture of iron ore, return fines, recycled products of the steel plant industry (such as mill scale, blast furnace dusts, etc.), slag forming elements, fluxes and coke fines are agglomerated in.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
Sinter quality begins with the mined iron ore and the proper selection and mixing of the raw materials. Inhomogeneous raw mix can affect permeability and cause an increase in fuel consumption. During the iron ore sintering process in iron and steel manufacturing, an online analyzer can be used to determine the elemental composition of the bulk
