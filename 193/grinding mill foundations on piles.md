Stirred Media Detritor (SMD) is a fluidized media grinding mill. It utilizes the rotational energy of the impeller arms to impart a high-energy motion to the media and slurry mixture inside the mill. This results in particle-to-particle shear and compressive forces that produce the desired grinding mechanism for fine grinding. Lower capital cost

## Grinding mill | Palamatic Process
The industrial pin mill (also known as a universal mill, turbo mill, and impact mill) is a one pass grinding equipment ideal for achieving the micronization of bulk materials and powdered products. Common applications involve the fine grinding of sugar, salt, sodium bicarb, etc. The average achievable particle size range of the pin mill is around a d50 of 80 microns.

## Pile foundations - Design, Construction and Testing Guide
Firstly, we find the geotechnical capacity and the structural capacity of the pile. Then the minimum of those values is taken as the capacity of the pile. Since the applied load is known, the number of piles can be calculated. Bored piles are constructed as single piles or group piles based on the applied loads.
