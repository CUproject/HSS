## Popular science of metal silicon manufacturing process
What is metal silicon. Although metal silicon is extracted from silica, not all silica is suitable for making metal silicon. Metal silicon, also known as industrial silicon and crystalline silicon. It is obtained by reducing carbon to silica. Metallic silicon is generally used in aluminum articles or as an additive to non-ferrous alloys.

The production process of Fe-Si consists of a high temperature process where SiO2 is reduced with C to Si and CO (g). The overall reaction of the process is based on the carbo-thermal reaction which is idealized as the reaction given below. SiO2 (s) + 2C (s) = 2Si (l) + 2CO (g) Delta H at 2000 deg C = 687 kJ/mol.

## Stainless Steel Manufacturing Processes - IspatGuru
This necessitated a well defined reduction period in which ferro silicon was used to reduce the oxidized chromium from the slag.  There are many different process routes available for stainless steel manufacturing process. One has to choose from these routes based on many factors which determine capital and operating costs.
