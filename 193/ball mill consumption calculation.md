## How To Calculate The Energy Consumption Of A Ball Mill
The mill product can either be finished size ready for processing, or an intermediate size ready for final grinding in a rod mill, ball mill or pebble mill. AG/SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening, a rod mill, and some or all of the work of a ball mill.

## Calculation of energy required for grinding in a ball mill
INTRODUCTION The energy consumption for grinding, according to Bond (1961), is deter- mined by the formula: / 10 10 (I) The work index is determined by grinding experiments carried out in a labo- ratory Bond ball mill. Based on the results of grinding experiments, numerical values of the work index Wi are calculated according to the formula
