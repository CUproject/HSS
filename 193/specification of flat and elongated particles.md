This test method covers the determination of the percentages of flat particles, elongated particles, or flat and elongated particles in coarse aggregates. Two procedures, Method A and Method B, are presented in this standard. Method A is a reflection of the original procedure as developed prior to Superpave and is intended for all non-Superpave applications.

## specification of flat and elongated particles
This research was conducted to determine if the specification for flat and elongated aggregates for use in Hot-Mix Asphalt HMA in Connecticut can be reasonably achieved Currently, the Connecticut Department of Transportation ConnDOT specification allows for no more than 10 percent flat and elongated particles utilizing a 3 1 ratio It has been speculated that this,
