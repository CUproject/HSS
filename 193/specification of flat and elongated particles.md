## specification of flat and elongated particles
This research was conducted to determine if the specification for flat and elongated aggregates for use in Hot-Mix Asphalt HMA in Connecticut can be reasonably achieved Currently, the Connecticut Department of Transportation ConnDOT specification allows for no more than 10 percent flat and elongated particles utilizing a 3 1 ratio It has been speculated that this,
