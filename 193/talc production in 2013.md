## Talc in Paper & Pulp Processing - Avani Group of Industries
Following is a snapshot of how Paper industry finds use for Talc powder: Powdered Talc is soft and chemically inert. As a result, it lowers abrasion to paper machine fabrics and mechanical tools during the production phase. Talc is hydrophobic (water-repellent) and organophilic in nature. Thus, its presence in the pulp reduces tackiness arising
