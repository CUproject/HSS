## What is the process by which gold becomes embedded in quartz?
Answer (1 of 2): I assume you are referring to gold-bearing veins of quartz, one of the natural occurrences of gold that is mined. As mentioned in The Geology of Hydrothermal Quartz Veins that are Gold Bearing cracks that were opened up in deeply buried bedrock did not tend to remain empty long.

For example, the chemical composition of the quartz sand ore in the Suling Malingshan Mine in is SiO2 79. 38%, Fe2O3 1. 68%, AL2O3 11.28%, and its particle size composition is -0.1 mm 65%. After the pre-processing operation, the grade of SiO2 is increased to 86.36%, the Fe2O 3 is reduced to 0.49%, and the AL2O 3 is reduced to 6.79%.

## Quartz Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the Earth's crust. As a mineral name, quartz refers to a specific chemical compound (silicon dioxide, or silica, SiO 2 ), having a specific crystalline form (hexagonal). It is found is all forms of rock: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. Quartz is physically and chemically resistant to weathering.

## Quartz Mining and Extraction | Quartz Mining Processing
Physical processing: the physical process involves cleaning the surface of the quartz. In magnetic separation and high tension separation the minerals and quartz are separated depending on the surface charge. Chemical processing: floatation and acid leaching are the two primary processes in which the trace minerals from the quartz are removed.

Fortunately, at-home testing isn't hard. You have three basic methods at your disposal: Magnetic Testing- Touch a magnet to the specimen. Pyrite is magnetic, gold isn't. Density- Measure the volume and weight of a gold-bearing stone. Quartz has a density of 2.65 g/cm³, while pyrite sits at 5 g/cm³. Gold will be 19.3g/cm.

By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
