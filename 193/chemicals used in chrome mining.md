## Extraction of Chromium from Chromite Ore
The average grade of the metallurgical chromite ore was 43.4 pct Cr2O3, with 52 pct of the ore having a chromium-to-iron ratio of 3:1 or over, 17.6 pct having a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1, and 30.4 pct having a ratio less than 2:1. Chemical-grade chromite ore generally ranged from 40 to 46 pct Cr2O3 with a chromium-to-iron ratio of 1.5:1 to 2:1.
