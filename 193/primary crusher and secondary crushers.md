Cone crushers are fed with pre-screened material from the primary crusher (usually a jaw crusher or primary gyratory), and the secondary crusher should always, if possible, have a scalped feed. Ideally, the deck on the scalping screen should have a cut point equal to the closed side setting (CSS) of the crusher.
