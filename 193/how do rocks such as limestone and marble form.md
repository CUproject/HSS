## How Marble Is Formed - Realonomics
Marble is a metamorphic rock that is created as a result of the metamorphosis of a combination of rocks under intense pressure and temperatures. These rocks include calcite limestone dolomite and serpentine. The main component of marble is calcium carbonate and contains acidic oxide. See also how can citizens influence the government.

## How Does Chemical Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.
