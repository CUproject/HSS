## Why tungsten has high melting point?
The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong metallic bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.  Tungsten has the highest tensile strength of any pure metal - up to 500,000 psi at room temperature. Even at very high temperatures over 1,500°C, it has the highest

## Which has the highest melting point among NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI?
The high melting point of ionic compound reflects its high lattice energy.  because the enthalpy of formation on NaF is the most negative and so NaF is the most stable compound among the alkali metal halides. Consequently the melting point would be the highest. Also the melting and boiling point always follow the trend : fluoride>chloride

## Tungsten
Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3,422 °C, 6,192 °F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1,650 °C, 3,000 °F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point.

Tungsten is the refractory metal with the highest melting point (3420 °C). As a refractory metal, the most important advantage of tungsten is that it has good high-temperature strength and good corrosion resistance to the molten alkali metal and steam. Only when tungsten is over 1000℃, oxide volatilization, and liquid phase oxides occur.

## What is the difference between melting point and melting range?
A wide melting point range (more than 5°C) usually indicates that the substance is impure; a narrow melting point range (O. 5-2°C) usually indicates that the substance is fairly pure. Why are melting points reported as a range? Different melting point determination techniques require different amounts of compound to be run effectively.

## Does metal have a low melting point?sewing
Score: 4.3/5 (26 votes) . As metals are giant lattice structures, the number of electrostatic forces to be broken is extremely large, and so metals have high melting and boiling points.This means that the melting point and boiling point of metals are more similar to those for ionic compounds than for covalent substances.

## Melting point of silver solderlbusarchiv
Silver soldering is a hard soldering method, and silver mixed with tin is utilised as a solder . The temperatures of the various hard solder vary from Soldering iron is a hand tool used to heat solder, usually from an electrical power supply at high temperatures above the melting point of a metal alloy.
