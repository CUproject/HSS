Artificial sand is produced by reducing larger pieces of aggregate into sand-sized aggregate particles. Manufactured sand can be manufactured to be a certain grain size that the buyer chooses, while natural sand can be a mix of coarse and fine grains. Manufactured sand tends to be more angular and flaky due to the crushing process.
