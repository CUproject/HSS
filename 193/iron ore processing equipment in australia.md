## Iron Ore Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In India, where iron ore processing is one of the major industries, the generation of tailings is estimated to be 10-25 % of the total iron ore mined, amounting to 18 million tons per year (Das et al., 2000 ). The tailings contain silica in high percentage (40-60 %, from various locations). This makes it a suitable raw material for the

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
