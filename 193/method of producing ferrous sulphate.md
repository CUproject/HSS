## A simple "acid copper" copperservice-in-essen-nrw
A simple "acid copper" copper plating bath uses copper sulphate dissolved in sulphuric acid, with copper anodes ('deep throw' and self-leveling plating solutions can get a lot more complicated, but they are still basically CuSO 4 + H 2 SO 4). So I suspect that a sulphuric acid anodising bath is likely to do a bit more than "little" to copper. Zincate Immersion Zinc Plating Solution Zincate
