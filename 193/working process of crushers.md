## Impact Crusher Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Rosin- Rammler distribution has also been found inadequate to generally describe crusher products. Work during the early 60's led to the concept of comminution as a repetitive process, with each step consisting of two basic operations — the selection of a particle for breakage and the subsequent breakage of this particle by the machine.

## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.
