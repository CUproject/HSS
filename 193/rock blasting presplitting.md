## rock blasting presplitting
Presplitting can be defined as 'a technique using lightly charged, closely spaced holes to induce a fracture plane along a required design profile, which isolates the rock to be blasted from the surrounding rock mass' The holes are generally fired instantaneously well in advance of any blasting in the adjacent rock

blasting, process of reducing a solid body, such as rock, to fragments by using an explosive. Conventional blasting operations include (1) drilling holes, (2) placing a charge and detonator in each hole, (3) detonating the charge, and (4) clearing away the broken material. Upon detonation, the chemical energy in the explosive is liberated, and the compact explosive becomes transformed into a

## Pre-Split Techniques: A Review | Agg-Net
Pre-splitting can be defined as 'a technique using lightly charged, closely spaced holes to induce a fracture plane along a required design profile, which isolates the rock to be blasted from the surrounding rock mass'. The holes are generally fired instantaneously well in advance of any blasting in the adjacent rock.

## A Static Fracturing Technology to Enhance the Permeability of Coalbed 
A Static Fracturing Technology to Enhance the Permeability of Coalbed: Mechanical Study: Low permeability of coalbed has always been a main bottleneck impeding the safety production of coal mines and the high-efficient gas recovery. A static fracturing technology, relied on hydraulic-driving modules to expand outwards for producing artificial fissures in coalbed, is proposed here for coalbed
