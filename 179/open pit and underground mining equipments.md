## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

## Coal mining
When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut (also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which

The Open-pit Mining Method Is Used When Large Coal Or Ore Deposits Are Found _____.? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand cinder and gravel).

These will be unique to the sequence of the open pit underground interaction, which can take any combination of the following forms: Scenario 1 - Open pit transitioning to underground; concurrent mining. Scenario 2 - Underground mining below existing open pit. Scenario 3 - Open pit mining through existing underground working.

Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.
