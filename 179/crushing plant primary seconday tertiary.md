## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
When stone is processed in mobile primary crushing plants, excavators or wheel loaders feed the rock into the crusher that is set up at the quarry face, gravel pit or in a recycling yard or demolition site. The crushed material is then either sent to the secondary/tertiary processing stage via stacking conveyors or transported by trucks.

Crushing is typically a dry operation that is performed in two- or three-stages (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary crushing). Lumps of run-of-mine ore as large as 1.5 m across are reduced in the primary crushing stage to 10-20 cm in heavy-duty machines. In most operations, the primary crushing schedule is the same as the mining schedule.
