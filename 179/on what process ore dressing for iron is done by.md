## Direct Iron Ore Smelting Process for Ironmaking - IspatGuru
Direct iron ore smelting (DIOS) process is a smelting reduction process for the production of hot metal (liquid iron). It is a two-stage process which has been developed in Japan. It uses non-coking coal in a powder or granular form to smelt iron ore fines into liquid iron (hot metal) and hence, there is no necessity of a coke ovens plant and a

## Iron ore crushing and screening process
Aug 3, 2022The iron ore processing and production process mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is more modern and suitable for high-hardness iron ore crushing and can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the subsequent grinding efficiency.
