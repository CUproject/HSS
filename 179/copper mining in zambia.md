## Copper production: Zambia vs. the DRC - Mining For Zambia
In 2013 the average production cost of copper in the DRC was $3,672 per tonne. This same cost was $4,582 in Zambia and $4,931 in South Africa. This contributes it to being a favoured mining destination in the region. However, investor uncertainty around mining policy has been increasing in recent years. The government is considering increasing

## Kangaluwi Copper Mine in the Lower Zambezi National Park, Zambia
Jan 5, 2022Description: In June 2021 the Zambian government has given the green light to the proposal for an open pit copper mine - the Kangaluwi project - in the heart of the Lower Zambezi National Park. The project could set an important precedent for the future development of its mining sector; that of mining activity within protected areas [1].

## Swiss extractivism: Switzerland's role in Zambia's copper sector
Zambia has had a long history of commercial copper extraction. Under the British South Africa Company's and later British colonial rule, its copper mines were owned by the Anglo American Corporation and the Roan Selection Trust. In 1969, five years after independence, the Zambian government nationalised the country's copper mines.

## Mining in Zambia
Mining companies in Zambia focus on excerpting copper and uranium, as well as gold, nickel and industrial deposits, which are more limited. For companies interested in mining operations, or the opening of mining companies, in Zambia, the Zambian Ministry of Mines, under which the Chamber of Mines is located, is the first port of call.
