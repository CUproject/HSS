## Ultrastable atomic copper nanosheets for selective electrochemical 
Syngas, as a mixture of primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is an extremely important raw material for many large-scale chemical industries such as production of hydrogen, ammonia, and hydrocarbon fuels (1-4).Currently, syngas is mainly produced from hydrocarbon feedstock (for example, natural gas, coal, biomass) through conventional processes, such as steam reforming, dry reforming with

## Important Questions for Class 12 Chemistry Chapter 6 General Principles 
How is copper extracted from a low grade ore of it? (All India 2012) Answer: Copper is extracted by hydrometallurgy from low grade ores. It is leached out using add or bacteria.  ΔG° for ZnO is higher than that of CO 2 and CO from carbon therefore above 1270 K AG° for reduction of ZnO by carbon is negative and hence ZnO is easily reduced

Ores are most often oxides; a common example is hematite (Fe 2 O 3). But metals can also be found in sulfides (like ZnS), sulfates (like BaSO 4), or carbonates—like what you will work with today. Copper can be found in a couple of different ores—one of which is malachite, which contains copper(II) carbonate.

Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element typically a metal . Examples are cinnabar (HgS) an ore of mercury sphalerite (ZnS) an ore of zinc or cassiterite (SnO2) an ore of tin (Mineral). What is metal ore Class 10? Minerals from which a metal</b> can be profitably extracted are called ores.

The copper should be obvious from its colour. The lead may be less obvious; it may appear as globules or as grey powder. The reactions confirm the place of carbon in the reactivity series, above lead and copper, as it reduces the metal oxides to the metals and is itself oxidised to carbon dioxide:
