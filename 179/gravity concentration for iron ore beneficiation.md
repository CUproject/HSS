## Characterisation and magnetic concentration of an iron ore tailings 
Based on the ore characteristics (e.g. particle size, mineralogy and grade), gravity concentration (jig and Humphreys spiral), magnetic separation (low and high-field) and inverse cationic flotation (especially applied to pellet feeds) are used [3], [4]. It is estimated that for each tonne of beneficiated iron ore, 400 kg of tailings are produced.

## Chrome ore beneficiation challenges & opportunities - A review
The beneficiation studies of Suresh et al. (1981), concludes that low grade chromite ore of 16-25% Cr 2 O 3, of Sitampundi area of India, cannot be upgraded by using tabling and flotation techniques, to meet the metallurgical grade due to the intimate association of iron in the lattice of chromite.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
At this time four of the above methods of beneficiation, i. e., Drying, Screening, Log Washing, and Table Concentration are in use, and a plant for a fifth process, magnetic concentration, is now under construction. Drying plants may be seen at the Brunt mine, at Mountain Iron, and at the Whiteside mine, at Buhl, the latter being inactive at
