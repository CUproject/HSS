## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## White Cement
White Cement. White portland cement has essentially the same properties as gray cement, except for color. It is readily available throughout North America. The color of white cement is determined by its raw materials and the manufacturing process. Metal oxides, primarily iron and manganese, influence the whiteness and undertone of the material.

In the cement industry, natural raw materials are processed to produce an end product which is a fine powder. As shown in the flow diagram, several size reduction processes are needed.  The dangers of manufacturing cement merely to meet such a specification were emphasised by Butler (1899, pp ), referring to stone grinding in 1898:

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement 
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.

The preheated raw materials roll down the kiln and get heated to such an extent that the carbon dioxide is driven off with combustion gases. The material is then heated to temperature of nearly 1400°C to 1500°C when it gets fused together. The fused product is known as the clinkers or raw cement.
