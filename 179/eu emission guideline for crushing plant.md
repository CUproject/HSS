5 days agoThe generation and emission characteristics of fine particulates (PM2.5) from three 300 MW power plant circulating fluidized bed boilers were investigated. One boiler had an external bed and used an electrostatic precipitator, the other two used an electrostatic filter precipitator and fabric filter, respectively. The particle size distribution of fine particles was performed by an electrical

## Fossil fuel power station
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, to produce electricity.Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electrical generator.The prime mover may be a steam turbine, a gas turbine or, in small plants, a reciprocating gas engine.

## EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) - Climate Action
The EU ETS works on the 'cap and trade' principle. A cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by the installations covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Within the cap, installations buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. The limit on the total number of allowances
