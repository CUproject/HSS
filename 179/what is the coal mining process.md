## How is Coal Formed? - Definition, Mining & Uses with Videos of Coal 
Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.

The mining process can be broken down into two categories: Surface Mining. Workers begin by striping the overburden, which is rock, soil, and ecosystem that lies above the surface. Underground mining. The digging of tunnels and sink shafts when the ore—or mineral deposit—is below the surface. Hand tools such as chisels, hammers, and wedges

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction - Greentumble
The process of strip mining also lowers groundwater levels around the mine. In order to remove the coal, vast quantities of groundwater are pumped out of the mine and as a result, surrounding ecosystems and farmland may become drier, and erosion may start to change the landscape. Strip mining also uses significant amount of water to suppress dust.

Mountaintop mining - this mining process is a great option for coal mining, and in this case, the tops of mountains are usually removed and dynamited in order to access the specific coal seams. Once the miners are able to remove the coal, they then cover the disturbed area with topsoil in order to plant trees and grass.

Mine development. Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. In open-pit coal mining, a pit is dug in an area and this pit becomes the open-pit mine, sometimes called a quarry.Open-pit mines can expand to huge dimensions, until the coal deposit has been mined or the cost of transporting becomes too great.

It can excavate 240,000 tons of coal or 240,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day, the equivalent of a 30-meter-deep soccer field. The coal produced in a day filled 2,400 coal cars.  Minecarts are used to move ore and other materials in the process of mining. Pans are used for placer mining operations, such as gold panning.

## CDC - Mining Feature - Coal Mine Explosion Prevention - NIOSH
Underground coal mining produces finely divided coal dust that deposits throughout the mine and serves as a source of combustible material for coal dust explosions. Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. This rock dust serves to inert the coal dust when applied in the proper proportion.
