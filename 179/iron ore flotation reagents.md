## iron ore iron and zinc argentina
The end of the last iron ore Super Cycle in early 2014 hit hard especially when the price bottomed in late 2015 at less than US$40/t. The pull back depth and six year span left forecasters with protracted pessimism coupled with depressing price outlooks and a view that seaborne market recovery, flooded by new mine projects was unimaginable.

## Reagents types in flotation of iron oxide minerals: A review
ABSTRACT Recently, beneficiation of iron from low-grade ores with high impurities has been a matter of discussion. Flotation is one of the most effective technologies for the upgrading of low-grade, finely grained iron ores. This method can also be applied to reduce the impurities content in magnetite concentrates obtained using wet low- and high-intensity magnetic separations. In this paper

2.1 Materials. The carbonate-containing iron ore was from Anshan Mining Industry Corp and was concentrated by magnetic separation. The distribution of particle sizes was listed in Table 1.Since the particles were very fine, we concluded that dispersants were very important for direct-reverse flotation of carbonate-containing iron ores.

## Collecting Agent-Mineral Interactions in the Reverse Flotation of Iron 
The route of reverse flotation is currently in widespread use in iron ore flotation practice. The majority of studies on reverse flotation of iron ore focused on reagents and reagent scheme [9,10,11,12,13]. The reverse flotation route can be classified into reverse cationic flotation and reverse anionic flotation, based on the collector type.

Queiroz (2003) verified that, for certain itabirite ore types, the use of attrition allows the increase of the mass recovery to the slimes and flotation concentrate fractions and the decrease of iron grade in the flotation tailings, iron grade in the slimes and SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and P grades in the concentrate, resulting in higher figures for Gaudin's selectivity index.

## iron ore flotation process and reagents
Sep 17, 2020the most popular flotation route in iron ore industry, the direct flotation of iron ox ides still appears desirable for some low grade iron ores that contain a vast amount of quartz. For example, at Republic Mine, Michigan, U.S.A., a hematite ore is upgraded from 36.5% Fe to 65.4% Fe with a Fe recovery of 82.5% using the direct flotation route.
