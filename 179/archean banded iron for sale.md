## Banded Iron formation, Genesis Stone, Wyoming Nephrite Jade and Agates 
Genesis Stone / Banded Iron Genesis Stone / Banded Iron is a sedimentary stone made of alternating layers of jasper and hematite or magnetite. It was formed 1.8 - 2.4 billion years ago in the ancient iron seas. These pieces were broken off from the main formation by an unknown event and left to weather on the Wyoming plains.

## Banded Iron-Formations through Much of Precambrian Time
Similarities between Proterozoic (~ 1.8-2.5 Gyr) and Archean (> 2.5 Gyr) banded iron-formations are probably more significant than their differences. The contrasts largely reflect differences in the tectonic settings of Proterozoic and Archean terrains. Archean banded iron-formations are not as thick nor laterally as extensive as the major Proterozoic iron-formations. Nevertheless, some

## Banded Iron Formation (BIF): How These Rocks Got Their Stripes
May 12, 2022Remember that iron rusts when it reacts with oxygen giving it a red tint. So over time, the seafloor collected rusted iron. This rusted iron is in the different layers of banded iron formation (BIF) created about 3.7 billion years ago. The alternating layers in banded iron formations represent rock being oxidized.

Implications for banded iron formations and metabolic evolution. The implication of our results for BIF genesis is that when the physiological electron acceptor for photosynthesis (CO 2) is abundant (as is presumed to have been the case in an Archaean ocean), the presence of significant quantities of H 2 in the atmosphere would not have precluded Fe(II) oxidation by anoxygenic phototrophs.

## Banded Iron Formations
Jan 10, 2022Banded Iron. Banded iron formations are chemically derived sedimentary deposits. We often think of sedimentary rocks as sands, silts, and clays carried by rivers and streams into oceans and lakes. The sediments accumulate in layers and eventually harden to form solid rocks under high temperatures and pressure from burial.

Apr 11, 2022Sort of home grown Archean Banded Iron. Less than 2 hours from our farm so a lot of fun to collect. The Jackson Co., Iron Formation is poorly studied. A good scientifically accepted age is Archean . But, there are two lone monadnocks or hills sitting in Cambrian Sandstone. A very conservative
