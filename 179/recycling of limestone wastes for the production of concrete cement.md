Fly ash has become widely used in making concrete. Cement concrete does not reduce the strength of concrete despite the addition of fly ash up to about 40% of the weight of cement under different conditions. Up to about 25% fly ash is added to the RMC. Fly ash improves the workability of concrete and reduces the w/c ratio and Strength increases.

## How can we reduce concrete's hefty carbon footprint? | Ensia
The Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies has developed a process that injects waste CO 2 into a typical concrete production process, effectively replacing a small amount of cement with CO 2 without compromising the concrete's strength or integrity. Once in the mix, the CO 2 changes into calcium carbonate, the chemical equivalent of the limestone used in the production of conventional cement.

## Recycling of Waste Limestone as Fine Aggregate for Conventional and 
In addition, the green concrete mixture exhibited a better performance in terms of engineering properties and durability in comparison with the normal concrete mixture. The results of the present study further support the recycling and reuse of waste limestone as fine aggregate in the production of green concrete. Access through your institution.
