## Rare Earth Elements | Renewable Energy | Supply Chain - C3 Solutions
Rare earth elements are essential to many sectors of our economy, including renewable energy, manufacturing, and defense equipment. Currently, China supplies about 80% of our REE, setting up a potential supply chain disaster. In order to improve our domestic supply chain we must modernize the permitting process to open mines, invest in our

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining
Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

Rare earth elements facts. Rare earth elements (REE) are a group of 15 elements referred to as the lanthanide series in the periodic table of elements. Although they are not true REEs, scandium and yttrium are included in this categorization because they exhibit similar properties to the lanthanides and are found in the same ore bodies.
