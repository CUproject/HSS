## Slag
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

Steel slag, a molten liquid melt of silicates and oxides, is a normal occurrence during the steel-making process, but it is also an expensive and detrimental consequence. Slag is created by the separation of the molten steel from impurities inherent in iron ore and scrap metal. Slag impurities degrade steel.

## Method for removing slag on the surface of molten metal by suction.
NIPPON STEEL CORP (Tokyo 100, JP) International Classes: C21C1/02; C21C7/00; F27D3/15; (IPC1-7): F27D3/15  but the separation of molten iron from slag is often incomplete and the blast furnace slag floats on the surface of the molten iron in the vessel. Performing various types of refining operation in one vessel is common practice in modern
