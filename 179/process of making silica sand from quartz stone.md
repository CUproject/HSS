## Difference Between Silica and Quartz
Silica. Silicon exists as its oxide in nature. Silica is the most common silicon oxide, with the molecular formula SiO 2 (silicon dioxide). Silica is an abundant mineral on the earth crust, and it is in sand, quartz and many other minerals. Some minerals have pure silica but, in some, silica are mixed with other elements.

## What is the difference between quartz and silica? - Mahaveer Mineral
Since sand availability is not an issue, Silica is easy to mine and relatively easy to process. Silica can be said synonym of SiO2 (Silicon dioxide), it is present on earth as sand naturally in pure form. Silica is available in both crystalline and amorphous forms. These are fine sized grains. Whereas the Quartz is bigger and rough.
