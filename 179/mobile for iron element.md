## Iron Element Facts - ThoughtCo
Iron is the 4th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. The Earth's core is believed to be comprised primarily of iron. Pure iron is chemically reactive and corrodes rapidly, especially in moist air or at elevated temperatures. There are four allotropes of iron known as 'ferrites'. These are designated α-, β-, γ-, and δ- with transition

## It's Elemental - The Element Iron
Archaeological evidence suggests that people have been using iron for at least 5000 years. Iron is the cheapest and one of the most abundant of all metals, comprising nearly 5.6% of the earth's crust and nearly all of the earth's core. Iron is primarily obtained from the minerals hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).The minerals taconite, limonite (FeO(OH)·nH 2 O) and siderite (FeCO 3
