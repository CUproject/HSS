## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Introduction. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) involves gold mining through basic rudimentary and semi-mechanized methods [].ASGM is usually associated with poor health and safety standards [].In 2017, an estimated 14-19 million miners were employed in ASGM globally [].In Zimbabwe, over 500,000 people are involved in artisanal and small-scale mining, which is largely ASGM [].

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.

Aug 4, 2021Artisanal and small-scale miners produce a third of Zimbabwe's total gold output. For example, in 2019 small-scale miners delivered 17, 478 tonnes, approximately 60% of total production. Gold output was 22 tonnes in 2016, 24,8 tonnes in 2017, peaked in 2018 at 33 tonnes (a ten-year high), then fell to 28 tonnes in 2019, and further declined
