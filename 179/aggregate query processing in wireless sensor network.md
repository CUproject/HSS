## An adaptive in-network aggregation operator for query processing in 
Adaptive query operators (algorithms) can adjust their behavior in response to specific events that take place during data processing. In this paper, we propose an adaptive in-network aggregation operator for query processing in sensor nodes of a WSN, called ADAGA (ADaptive AGgregation Algorithm for sensor networks).

Nodes of the network form an aggregation tree, in which parent nodes aggregate the values received from their children and propagate the result to their own parents.

## Curve Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
Most existing query processing algorithms for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can only deal with discrete values. However, since the monitored environment always changes continuously with time, discrete values cannot describe the environment accurately and, hence, may not satisfy a variety of query requirements, such as the queries of the maximal, minimal, and inflection points. It is
