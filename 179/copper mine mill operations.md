## Mine operating costs and the potential impacts of energy and grinding
Potential cost savings measures. This study has found that in general the relative Mining and Milling costs of a given operation do not significantly differ, and generally fall within the range of 43:43:14 to 45:45:10 (Mine:Mill:G & A). In addition, G & A costs were found to be consistently lower than both Milling and Mining costs.
