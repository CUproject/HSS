## Global cement emissions standards
Dust is emitted from storage, crushing, grinding and pyroprocessing in cement plants. It is the industry's most obvious pollutant, since you can actually see it. It can cause respiratory problems. Some of the earliest cement plant emission regulations were for dust. The German Cement Association (VDZ) set up a dust committee as early as the 1930s.

The production of asbestos-cement sheets became possi-ble in 1907 when Austrian Ludwig Hatschek brought his pat-ented process to the United States. Forming and curing pro-cesses were improved and it was not long before shingles and corrugated panels for roofs and walls were manufactured. A wide range of asbestos-cement products, such as pipes

## Dust exposure and the risk of cancer in cement industry workers in 
In the present study, we examined the association between dust exposure and cancer in cement industry workers in Korea. Methods: Our cohort consisted of 1,324 men who worked at two Portland cement manufacturing factories between 1997 and 2005. We calculated cumulative dust exposures, then categorized workers into high and low dust exposure groups.
