## Mining Waste Management and Disposal Methods - MiningNewsWire
Mining produces a lot of waste which should be disposed of properly. Improper waste disposal leads to soil, water and air pollution. There are various types of mining. They include coal mining, metal, landfill mining, oil and gas extraction and non-metal ore mining. This means there are also different types of mining waste. These include: .

## Evaluation of Mining Methods for Thick Tabular Ore Deposits
Evaluation of Mining Methods for Thick Tabular Ore Deposits. Tabular ore deposits form a major portion of the reserves of the coal, potash, trona, and limestone that are mined by underground methods, while some copper and lead-zinc deposits are also tabular in shape. Oil shale mining represents a new addition to this group.

Likely mine sites were identified by surface finds. Ore was extracted and removed by iron hand tools, and lifted up the shaft using a rope. In the 16th century, miners were still using fire-setting and wooden trays. In 1600 years, mining technology progressed very little beyond the Roman practices.

## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
Extracting Lead Materials from Ore. Lead is a dense, soft, low-melting metal. Lead is the densest common metal except for gold, and this quality makes it effective in sound barriers and as a shield against X-rays.Lead resists corrosion by water, so it makes a long-lasting roofing material.. Only about half of the lead materials used today are produced from mining, the rest is obtained from

## Types of Mining Methods | Cummins Inc.
Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.
