The density of bricks or weight per unit volume depends mostly on the type of clay used and the method of brick molding (soft-mud, Stiff-mud, hard-pressed etc.). In the case of standard bricks, density varies from 1600 kg/cubic meter to 1900 kg/cubic meter. A single brick (19 x 9 x 9 cm) will weigh between 3.2 to 3.5 kg. depending upon its density.
