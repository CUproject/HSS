All, Appreciate the comments! I used Chapman's flux. My understanding is that it is useful for separating iron from gold. Seems to oxidize the iron pretty well, but not well enough I suspect. I increased the amount of borax to 4 times original proportions. Did a really good job reducing viscosity of the melt.
