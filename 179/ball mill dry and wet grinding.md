## Which mill used for wet grinding?
The dry mill process grinds the entire corn kernel and mixes it with water and enzymes. The slurry is then sent to aging tanks. The wet mill process starts with the corn kernels being soaked in large tanks of water. The kernels are then ground up and sent to a series of separation processes.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
