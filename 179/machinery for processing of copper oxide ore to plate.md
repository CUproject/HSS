Sep 8, 2021Abstract An analysis of flowsheets for processing sulfide and oxide copper ores, reagent modes, processing equipment, and flotation indicators in some domestic and foreign processing plants and productions is carried out. Autogenous and semiautogenous mills are commonly used in the primary grinding stage in ore processing plants, which excludes medium and fine crushing. The alternative is high

## Heap Leaching of Copper Ores - State of the Science
While gold heap leaching dates back to the 1960s, large scale copper heap leaching commenced in Chile from the 1980s, and sulphide heap leaching emerged essentially as a consequence of acid leaching from mixed oxide/sulphide ores from the 1990s (Watling, 2006).
