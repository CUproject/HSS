Mercury in food. Mercury is a metal that is released into the environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Once released, mercury undergoes a series of complex transformations and cycles between atmosphere, ocean and land. Of the chemical forms of mercury, methylmercury is by far the most common form in the food chain.

## How Mercury & Gold Amalgamation Works - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Mercury is sometimes added direct to the outside plates, and sometimes their condition is regulated by the additions of mercury in the mortar box. The amount added varies with the conditions of crushing and the richness of the ore, but in general from 1 to 2 ounces of mercury are fed in for every ounce of gold contained in the ore.
