## The Steel Manufacturing Process - How is Steel Made?
Today's steel is generally produced in one of two ways: Blast furnace: The blast furnace process, also known as the basic oxygen process (BOP), combines raw iron ore with small amounts of steel scrap metal into a furnace. Then, pure oxygen is blown into the furnace, raising its temperature. Not only does the scrap metal melt into a liquid at

## Explain in detail the processes involved in the production of pig iron 
Pig iron can be moulded into different types of shapes. Steel making is defined as a process used for the production of steel from scrap and iron ore. In this process, impurities like sulphur, nitrogen, silicon and excess carbonate are removed from sourced iron. Siemens - Martin and Bessemer have turned steel making into a heavy industry.

## Manufacture of Steel - Steel Manufacturing Process and Steps
The first step in the steel manufacture begins at the blast furnace. To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal), limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.
