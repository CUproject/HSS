## Aggregate Crushing Value Test | Crushing Value of Aggregate - Civiconcepts
The aggregate Crushing Value Test is an important test to be performed on aggregate.The strength of aggregate parent rock is determined by preparing cylindrical shape specimens of size 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height.. This cylinder is subjected to compressive stress.Depending on the type of parent rock gives the different crushing values of aggregate as a compressive strength varying
