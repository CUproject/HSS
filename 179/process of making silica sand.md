The silica sand is an assemblage of individual silica grains in the size range upto 2 mm. Sand can be formed in nature by natural weathering of sandstone and quartzite or mechanically by crushing a sandstone /quartzite or by a process of flotation whereby the various constituents in a pegmatite or kaolin mixture are separated.

Silica sand consists of well-rounded, sand composed of almost pure quartz grains. Quartz, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), is the most common mineral found on the Earth's surface and is found in rocks like granite, gneiss, and sandstone. The value of silica sand can be significantly higher than sand and gravel used in the con- struction industry.

Such sand deposits are said to be mature because other rock-forming minerals are already broken down by the weathering process leaving only the super-resistant quartz as a residue. Silica sand is a mineral resource. It is mined mostly for glass-making. Another major use of sand is a concrete production but that does not need sand to be as pure.

## What Is the Difference Between Washed Sand & Silica Sand? - Al Manaratain
Washed Sand. 'Washed' refers to the process of removing clay, silt, dust and other unwanted particles from the sand. Once the excess materials have been removed, the sand is left to drain. Washed sand is ideal for rendering, mixing concrete and for making a less malleable mortar that is often used for and flagstones.

SILICA SAND is one of the world's most common sand types. Silica sand is used for construction, glass making, filling and for the development of moulds and castings. Sands is the general term for broken mineral or rock granules which fall between slats and gravity in the range of sizes and are generally between one sixteenth of a millimetre and two millimetre in diameter.
