## What is the difference between froth flotation and gravity separation 
Answer (1 of 2): Let's think about this: Both are in the end gravity processes. I will do them backwards, though. Gravity separation depends upon the difference in density / specific gravity of a solid and a fluid (liquid or gas). Particles more dense that the fluid will tend to fall, unless the

Gravity separation is the primary mechanism of pollutant removal in stormwater treatment systems. Removal occurs downward for solids denser than water like sediment, and upward for solids lighter than water such as dispersed droplets of petroleum, oil, and paper. The former is sedimentation; the latter is flotation.

## gravity based separation flotation
It is concluded that gravity-based separation is capable of a more selective separation than froth flotation if an enhanced gravity field can overcome the slow particle velocities. Nevertheless, Oruç et al. [ 20 ] evaluated the effects of different process variables on the performance of the Falcon concentrator in recovering ultrafine coal

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

## gravity based separation flotation
At fine particle sizes, separation by density difference under gravity, becomes less efficient. At this size range flotation is the dominant separation process, though the application of centrifugal acceleration has extended the useful separation size by gravity processes down to 5-10 μm, provided the concentration criterion is favourable.

## Kaolin Purification,Gravity Separation,Magnetic Separation,Flotation 
1. Kaolin Gravity Separation. The gravity separation method mainly uses the density difference between gangue mineral and kaolin to remove high-density impurities such as light organic matter, quartz, feldspar and iron-titanium-manganese, thereby reducing the effect of impurities on whiteness.
