What are steel pellets used for? Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing.The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the United States.

iron ore is expected to rise by more than 200 million tonne per year to meet the internal demand & export. This additional requirement of iron ore will need beneficiation of low grade ore/fines to get the major portion of increased demand.

Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and

## Iron ore pricing explained - Fastmarkets
Sinter fines and lumps make up the bulk of the seaborne iron ore market, and are the products most frequently traded on a spot basis, so daily pricing is used for the key 62% Fe, 58% Fe and 65% Fe fines, and lump premium references. By contrast, the beneficiated ore segment - comprising pellet and concentrate - is smaller in terms of both

## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
Several methods/techniques such as jigging, washing, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are being used to enhance the iron percentage in the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. Iron ore is normally beneficiated utilizing the

## The Iron Ore Deposits of Odisha: Strategies to Augment the Resources 
Hence, optimal use of existing low grade iron ore resources with special emphasis on conservation of high grade ores will be encouraged. Because of the finer particle size (<0.15 mm) it is expected that the mineral phases present in the slimes will be in liberated forms which may ease the beneficiation process without applying any comminuting
