## Concentration of Ores - GeeksforGeeks
Concentration of ores is done before using all of these methods of metal extraction based on their reactivity. Many impurities, such as rock fragments, sand, and other impurities, can be present in the ore. Matrix or gauge refers to the impurities in a mineral. Concentration ore refers to the process of removing matrix or gauge from an ore.

## What is Concentration of Ore? Definition, Physical & Chemical Methods 
The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## Electrostatic Concentration Ores & Minerals
Electrostatic separation of ores in its present form is generally known as the Huff process, from the name of Charles H. Huff, of Boston, Mass., through whose constant and persistent labors (with the invention of Clinton E. Dolbear as a basis) the successful commercial process embracing separative machinery and the various electrifying devices has been developed step by step, and the finances
