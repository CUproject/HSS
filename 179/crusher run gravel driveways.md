## Driveway millings or crush/run? Community Forums
Posts: 14,952. Received 589 Votes on 505 Posts. I have used road millings and crushed concrete for my driveway and I have good results with both. The only downside is crushed concrete can be quite dusty and asphalt road millings may have some larger chunks that you might have to filter out.
