Dolomite is calcium magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO 3)2]. In its pure form it contains 20.8% Ca and 12.5% Mg. Commercial grades of magnesite and dolomite contain some impurities, and have a lower nutrient content than this. Dolomite typically contains from 8 12.5% Mg. As well as supplying magnesium, magnesite and dolomite help correct soil acidity.

## Dolomite Supplement: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, Dose  - MedicineNet
Jun 11, 2021Kidney disease: Extra magnesium and calcium can harm people with kidney disease. Since dolomite is a source of both of these minerals, don't use it if you have serious kidney problems. Sarcoidosis: This condition increases the risk of absorbing too much calcium. Don't take dolomite if you have this condition, because it is a source of calcium.

Magnesium is the eighth most common element in the crust of the Earth [1, 2] and is mainly tied up within mineral deposits, for example as magnesite (magnesium carbonate [MgCO 3]) and dolomite.Dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2 is, as the name suggests, abundant in the Dolomite mountain range of the Alps [].The most plentiful source of biologically available magnesium

## Determination of calcium and magnesium in limestone and dolomite by 
A flow-enthalpimetric method for the determination of calcium and magnesium in limestone and dolomite is described. Calcium is determined by measuring the heat evolved from the substitution reaction with Mg-EDTA. The amount of magnesium is calculated from the calcium content and the enthalpimetric s .

## Magnesium(Dolomite) supplementation | CattleToday
Dec 28, 2003. #4. Dolomite is calcium not magnesium. To supplement magnesium you need magnesium oxide, or a mineral containing that. Magnesium oxide is about 56% magnesium, so you need to adjust the amount fed to match the need. Magnesium is also bitter so cows need to have the taste masked if they need to be supplimented.
