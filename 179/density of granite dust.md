## Stone Dust: What It Is, Uses, and Where to Buy It - The Spruce
Jun 21, 2022What Stone Dust Is . When stones are run through a crushing machine to make crushed stone, stone dust also forms. Its exact composition will depend on what kind of stone was run through the machine. For instance, sometimes granite is run through such a machine; in other cases, it could be limestone, for example.

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ɪ t / (UK) or / ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t / (US) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.

## Dust Grano 6mm | Tarmac
Building Aggregates. Grano (6mm - dust) for use in mixing with cement to make fine concrete. Place on top of a new concrete surface and polish for a tough finish. Grano Dust is gritty aggregate typically manufactured from either limestone or granite. Widely used in construction and building it is a flexible material.
