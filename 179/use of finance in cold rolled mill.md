## Cold Rolling - Process Overview - Matmatch
Cold rolling takes the hot rolled product and processes it further. After hot rolling, the steel is cooled to room temperature, then passed through cold rollers at a temperature lower than its recrystallisation temperature. This rolling process is called annealing and relieves stress and leads to a higher yield strength and greater hardness.
