## bearing capacity of ball mill dust
bearing capacity of crusher dust grinding mill. Ball Mills Mineral Processing Metallurgy. The apparent difference in capacities between grinding mills listed as being the same size is due to the fact that there is no uniform method of designating the size of a mill for example a 5 x 5 Ball Mill has a working diameter of 5 inside the liners and has 20 per cent more capacity than all other ball
