## grinding in second compartment
The size reduction takes place in a two- compartment tube mill; the first compartment of the mill is shorter than the second compartment. The coarse clinker is ground in the first compartment where larger balls (80, 60, 50 mm) are used and the fine grinding is done in the second compartment where smaller balls (below 25 mm) are used.

Lifting liners are used to enhance impact in first compartment, where coarse grinding is dominated by impact. In second compartment which is longer in size (L>1.5D), classifying liners are used to ensure media classification along the length of mill with large size balls near mid partition and smaller balls at mill discharge end.

## grinding in second compartment
Oct 23, The efficiency of fine grinding in the second compartment is largely controlled by the size of grinding balls. Due to limitation of the mill's rotational speed, the smallest ball size is usually restricted to about 15 mm. Cement grinding using stirred mills ( Pilevneli and Azizli, 1999 ) indicates that using smaller media (5-8 mm

Mar 05, 2019¬∑ A 1 compartment grinder has only the grinding chamber. You put your weed in and take it out of the same compartment. A grinder with 2 compartments is a bit more convenient.

grinding is done in the second compartment where smaller balls (below 25mm) are used. A diaphragm separates the two compartments and allows only particles below a certain size to pass to the second compartment.
