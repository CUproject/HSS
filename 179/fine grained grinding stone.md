Fine Grinding (flat parts - single or double-side) is the abrasive machining process for removing material using a bonded Superabrasive wheel at low speed with a liquid to keep the part cool.

## How grinding wheel is made - material, history, used, parts, components 
Throughout the grinding wheel's history, the bond that holds the abrasive grains together has proven as important as the grains themselves. The success of grinding wheels began in the early 1840s, when bonds containing rubber or clay were introduced, and by the 1870s a bond with a vitrified or glass-like structure was patented.

## The History and Importance of Stone Milling | Royal Lee Organics
Stone milling was the norm throughout history until around the 19 th century. As times and cooking practices changed, it was found that stone milling didn't produce flour that was fine enough for making pastries. Stone milling also produces a nutty flavor and texture that consumers were finding less than ideal for some of their recipes.
