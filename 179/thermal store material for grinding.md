Fill a syringe with the mixture obtained and apply a thin layer on the CPU (or even on the heatsink on the contact side). It will work, in theory, for 3-4 months but it is better to keep the situation under control and replace it every 15-30 days. At the time of its removal, small spots may be seen on the metal.

## Metallurgical Reasons for Grinding Cracks and Their Detection
Mechanical effects and proper grinding result in a compressive residual stress at the surface. This is beneficial for fatigue. Thermal effect produces the opposite effect, with a residual tensile field at the surface. As the part is locally heated, the surface layer expands, but it is constrained by the lower undisturbed material.

## A guide to thermal energy stores - Energy Saving Trust
Apr 1, 2022Thermal stores are very important for the efficiency of biomass heating systems, particularly log boilers, which are designed to burn batches of logs at high levels of efficiency, rather than in small quantities throughout the day.A log boiler linked to a large thermal store can be used in this way. A thermal store can also reduce the time lag (which could be at least an hour) between lighting

Thermal stores linked to wood fuel heating systems are commonly referred to as accumulators or buffer tanks. Typically, they will hold between 500 to 5000 litres of water and can store hot water for days if properly insulated. The sizing of a thermal store for a wood-fuelled heating system will depend on many factors including the type of wood
