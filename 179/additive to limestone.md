The added limestone in the U.S. is modern portland cement and consists of ground clinker, a source of readily soluble sulfates and functional additives. The change is that the specification adds up to 5% limestone. The biggest difference in production is that the limestone is added to the clinker blend before grinding.

Limestone is a soft, light-colored rock with a grainy texture, which fizzes in the presence of acid. Chalk is a form of limestone. What distinguishes limestone and makes it useful is a high calcium content ("calcium" and "chalk" are cognates). Specifically, it is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), the same substance that makes up seashells.
