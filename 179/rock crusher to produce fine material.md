## Sustainable production of crushed sands using crushing machines
The centerpiece of the plant is the rotor impact mill from BHS-Sonthofen, which, in contrast to conventional VSI rotor crushers, even further reduces fine grain sizes. Kasprs can thus make use of off-spec material of other companies to produce high-quality Plaster Sand and Dry Mortar Sand for the construction industry.

These crushers are designed so that the head-to-depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to each other. The flatter cone angles help to retain the particles longer between the crushing surfaces and therefore produce much finer particles.
