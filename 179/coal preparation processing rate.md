Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.

The standard practice on coal in England has been to use cell-to-cell "Sub-A" Flotation Machines of the double overflow type. Several hundred of the large No. 30 cells (100 cu. ft./cell) are in use. Super-charging is not generally used. Flotation is carried out at low solids, usually under 10% dilution.

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground.  The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.  Longwall systems allow a 60-to-100 percent coal recovery rate when surrounding geology allows their use. Once the coal is removed
