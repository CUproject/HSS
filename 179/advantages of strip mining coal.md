Surface or strip mining damages and pollutes ecosystems to a great degree. This is because by definition the process of strip mining involves striping away trees, plants and topsoil so that the coal can be accessed underneath. This means that surface mining destroys mountain tops, landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats.

## Coal mining
When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open-cut (also referred to as open-cast, open-pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which

Jan 28, 2022Why Is Strip Mining Bad? Strip mining destroys landscapes forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees plants and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams sediments pollute waterways. Feb 14 2018

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of underground mining?
Shallow mineral or coal deposits can be economically mined by open-pit or strip mines. However, with deeper mineral or coal deposits it becomes very costly to remove a great deal of overburden in these kinds of settings. So, in these cases underground mining is more cost effective. The downside is that human health and safety are at greater
