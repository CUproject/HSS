## The Mining Life: Open Pit vs. Underground - Micromine
There's an obvious distinction between open pit mines and underground mines that leads to the main differences from the miners' perspectives. Open pit mines allow for heavy machinery and workers to do their jobs in the open and usually with more maneuverability. Open pit mines don't have to safeguard against loss of air and cave-ins, but

## Do open pit mine?tankandlift
Open pit mining is the most widely used technique of mining copper today. It is accomplished by creating and using benches or terraces to gradually reach deeper under the earth's surface.  Open-pit mining is much safer than shaft mining. In underground mining, the threat of a cave-in or release of toxic gas is a constant concern.

When would open-pit mining be most useful? 4.2 Open-pit mining Open-pit mining is probably most advanced because of developments in mining low-grade copper deposits and iron ore. It is suitable for much of the resource if it is done on a large scale and will allow low-cost removal of most of the resource.

Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest underground copper mine. Open pit mining is employed when the orebodies are extensive, low in grade, and relatively near the surface, where they can be quarried after removal of overburden.

## Amacan Open Pit Copper Mine In Compostela Valley, Philippines
The Amacan Open Pit Copper Mine is in Compostela Valley, Philippines. The site was first discovered in 1963. The Amacan Open Pit Copper Mine was closed at the time of data entry with no known plans to re-open. Mine operations consist of surface workings extending 66.00 hectares (163.09 acres). There is one known shaft.

## Why are open pit mines safer? - Realonomics
Open pit mining does offer some advantages over traditional deep shaft mining. Pit mining is more cost effective than shaft mining because more ore can be extracted and more quickly. The working conditions are safer for the miners because there is no risk of cave in or toxic gas.

## Open-pit mining
Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.
