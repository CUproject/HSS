A small handheld magnet was used to separate approximately 5 pct of roaster feed and roaster product as the magnetic fractions. Nonmagnetic roaster feed particles appear to be primarily zinc sulfide, with an iron sulfide evenly distributed throughout (fig. 4A).  Cadmium, a minor metal in zinc ores, is the subject of this report.

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel,  with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and,
