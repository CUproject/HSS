## limestone mining, limestone crushing, limestone processing production line
The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

## IELTS Task 1 Process- Cement and Concrete Production
Making concrete is a simpler process that involves mixing four ingredients in a concrete mixer. Limestone and clay are crushed and the resulting powder is then mixed before being passed through a rotating heater. Once heated this mixture travels over a conveyor belt and is ground through a grinder. Now that the cement has been produced, it is
