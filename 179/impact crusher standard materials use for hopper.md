## Impact crusher vs. Cone Crusher | X vs Y
The impact crusher is composed of an impact plate, a board hammer, a rotor, a feed hopper and few insignificant parts. The working principle of the impact crusher is very simple: the material is thrown to the impact plate and crushed until it can easily pass through the bottom opening or discharge gap. The discharge gap can be adjusted

The Vertical Shaft Impactors or VSI Crusher are one type of impact crushers, which offer higher reduction ratios at a lower energy consumption. These impactors. can be considered as a 'stone pump' operating like a centrifugal pump. The material is fed through the centre of the rotor, where it is accelerated to high speed before being discharged through openings in the rotor periphery.
