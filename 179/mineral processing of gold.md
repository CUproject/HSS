## The role of microorganisms in gold processing and recovery—A review
Gold complexes can be highly toxic to microorganisms. Hence, microorganisms have many mechanisms to deal with toxic gold complexes and are able to precipitate gold intra- and extracellularly, and in products of their metabolism, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS) and sulphide minerals ( Reith et al., 2007a ).

Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Mineral Processing | SpringerLink
The run-of-mine extracted from the ground requires further processing in order to make a marketable product. This preparation is called mineral processing. Thus, ores must go through a number of different operations to obtain the final products: comminution or size reduction, size separation, concentration or beneficiation, and dewatering.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be
