## How a Thickener Works - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
How a Thickener Works. Thickening or dewatering may be defined as the removal of a portion of the liquid from a pulp or slime made up of a mixture of finely divided solids and liquids. The early methods of thickening employed plain, flat-bottomed tanks into which the pulp was fed until the tank was full. The solids were then allowed to settle

## thickener in benification plant
Thickening and water circulation are important processes in coal beneficiation cycles. Rather frequently reasonable arrangement of these processes influences not only on plant production rate and quality of final product but on its overall operating capability as well.

As a consequence, new coal-fired power plants given permits to construct or operate between 1977 and 1990 were required to use FGD. A variety of SOx control technologies are now used to reduce SOx emissions to the atmosphere. Some SOx technologies, e.g., coal beneficiation, coal gasification, and solvent refining, remove S prior to combustion.

## Optimization of Coal Beneficiation Plans for SO2 Emissions Control
mates of the role of coal cleaning as a cost-effective method of sulfur emissions reduction from coal combustion. In recent years, concern over the acid rain issue has in- creased the national and international interest in sulfur re- moval technologies suitable for coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers.

## Some opportunities to increase performance of tailing thickener case 
Thickener is a major and convenient applied equipment for tailings dewatering in mineral processing plants. Past investigations have shown that feed slurry dilution can improve flocculation efficiency by affecting both floc size and density. Advantages of thickener feed dilution method include reduced flocculent consumption, increased settling flux, and enhanced bed/sediment compressibility
