## Resin Gold Extraction Process —— A Rising Star
Jul 2, 2022The resin gold extraction process is a pulp adsorption process in which ion exchange resin is used in chemical beneficiation to treat ore leachate to extract target components. It is similar to the common activated carbon adsorption process in the gold extraction process, except that the adsorption medium is changed from activated carbon to ion exchange resin.

Gold-selective IX resins are stripped with a mixture of H 2 SO 4 /thiourea, to overcome the strong bond between the resin and gold-cyanide complex. The process is efficient and complete gold elution is achieved within 6 to 8 hours. Additional steps may be included [9] to selectively strip base metals prior to gold.

## Cyanide Gold Extraction Process - JXSC Machine
The existing cyanide gold plant in China's gold mines basically adopts two types of gold extraction process, one is a so-called conventional cyanidation process for gold extraction by continuous countercurrent washing with a thickener, and the gold is replaced by zinc powder (CCD method and CCF). The other method is a non-filtered cyanide

However, the resin gold extraction process also has shortcomings, mainly the following two points: (1) Resin is prone to aging during recycling. So the resin adsorption capacity is relatively reduced. The density of the resin in the pulp must be increased to meet the requirements of gold adsorption.
