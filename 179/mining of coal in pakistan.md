Pakistan is a country, which is rich in coal. With the existing coal mining, Pakistan supplies coal to other parts of the world. However, due to the slowdown in the economic growth of China and America, coal exports from Pakistan have also decreased. One of the other reasons for this decrease is the global response to anti-pollution drives.
