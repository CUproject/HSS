Jan 31, 2021Generally, an idling car uses somewhere between 1/5 to 1/7 gallon of fuel per hour. Compact cars that carry a 2-liter capacity engine burn around 0.16 - 0.3 gallons of gas on a per hourly basis. A large sedan, on the other hand, with a 4.6-liter engine, burns approximately 0.5 - 0.7 gallons of gas while idling.

Jul 26, 2022Over the course of a year, a long-haul truck could idle for about 1,800 hours, using nearly 1,500 gallons of diesel, which is $5.82 per gallon in the US as of June 2022. For one heavy truck, the cost of idle fuel waste averages about $8,730. Idling a heavy-duty truck consumes about 0.8 gallon of fuel per hour.3 Semi-trucks and heavy-duty trucks

But from days in Big Rigs the assumption was 1 gallon per hour for a diesel engine at idle. You might infer that folks are getting 1-2 regens per tank of fuel, so a regen every 12-20 gallons of fuel. Which would allow for 8 hours of idle with out needing a active regen. This assume that idling produces the same amount of soot as driving.

Assuming an SD70 at notch 8 is producing 4000 HP, say 3000 kW into the generator, in one hour it will use 3000 x 1 x 0.210 = 630 kg = 750 litres.
