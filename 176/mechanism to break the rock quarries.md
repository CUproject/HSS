## All crusher types for your reduction needs - Metso Outotec
A large primary crusher is, naturally, more expensive than a smaller one. Therefore, the investment cost calculations for primary crushers are compared together against the total costs of primary stages, including quarry face clearing, blasting, and drilling costs. In many cases, dump trucks transport the rock to a stationary primary crusher.

## Surface Mining For Construction Aggregates: Rock Quarries, Sand And 
Sources of construction materials come and go, but rock quarries and their associated products like sand and gravel have been around for centuries. Used in concrete, roads, landscaping, drain fields, fills, foundations, and even hourglasses, aggregate demand for sand and gravel has been a source of constant activity for surface mines and other quarries.

##  Controlled Blasting at Quarries - Ossga
Quarries remove bedrock from the ground to produce aggregate materials for use in the construction industry. The first step in this process is the blasting of the rock. Explosive charges are placed within holes drilled into the rock and detonated to break and dislodge the rock. This technique is also used in mining, road construction, utility

## Quarries and Pits and Mines (Oh My!): Why They're Important
Kapowsin Quarry is a basalt quarry. Unlike a granite or marble quarry, we don't cut rock into perfectly rectangular blocks. Instead, we break up rock deposits with dynamite. The rock is blown into large pieces, which are sorted by size. Most of the rock is broken down even more and crushed into pieces of many different sizes.
