## Macraes Operation - OceanaGold
The operation consists of a large-scale surface mine, an underground mine, and an adjacent process plant inclusive of an autoclave for pressure oxidation of the ore. Its annualised gold production is split approximately 75% to open pit production and about 25% underground production.
