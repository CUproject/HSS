## Tellurium
Most Te (and Se) is obtained from porphyry copper deposits, where it occurs in trace amounts. The element is recovered from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of blister copper. It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tellurium.

Copper Ore is a block added by Tinkers' Construct. It can be mined with a Stone Pickaxe and smelted in a Smeltery to produce two Copper Ingots. Alternatively, for less copper, you are able to cook Copper Ore in a furnace. Copper is used in many things throughout the Tinker's Construct Mod. It can be made into a copper block if you have 9 copper ingots and 1 copper ingot can be breaked down

Copper can be extracted, with very small amounts of nickel, at pH 6.0 to 6.5, while nickel is extracted from the copper raffinate at pH 8.0 to 8.2. These pH values refer to the pH of the aqueous phase entering solvent extraction; the corresponding equilibrium pH values are approximately 4.7 (copper) and 6.2 (nickel).
