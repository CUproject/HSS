How gold is made . Gold is generally found in two types of deposits lode (vein) or placer deposits the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit Once extracted the gogold referred to as flour flood or colloidal gold is lost in processing Early miners recovered no more than 60% of as-sayed gold values and as late as 1945 recovery of free gold.

## Alluvial gold processing plant - gold wash plant supplier from China
Alluvial is a term that refers to soil sediments and the various sand, silt, gravel, clay or other deposited matter left behind by flowing water. "Alluvial gold" refers to the type of gold dust found in that kind of soil. When the beds of rivers or streams are scooped and panned for gold dust, the product is referred to as alluvial gold.
