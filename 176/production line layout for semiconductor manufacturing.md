## Virtual production lines design for back-end semiconductor 
This paper introduces the virtual production line (VPL) concept, which initiates a new method to model the shop floor from both control and management point of view. Heuristic algorithms are presented to dynamically configure a large system into many VPLs, which ensure the line balance and efficiency, and accurately predicate the completion time for each work-order. The proposed methodology

## Semiconductor Manufacturing Process (Back-End Process)
Feb 9, 2022Semiconductor manufacturing is divided into design, front-end, and back-end processes, with the design process being the design and the front-end process being printing. The next step was to cut the samples into pieces. Semiconductors undergo a design process, and large-scale integrated circuits (LSI) are created on silicon wafers in the front

## Chipmakers Are Ramping Up Production to Address Semiconductor  - SIA
Feb 26, 2021Here's why: manufacturing a finished semiconductor wafer, known as the cycle time, takes about 12 weeks on average but can take up to 14-20 weeks for advanced processes. To perfect the fabrication process of a chip to ramp-up production yields and volumes takes even much more time - around 24 weeks.

Semiconductor device fabrication. Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture semiconductor devices, typically integrated circuit (IC) chips such as modern computer processors, microcontrollers, and memory chips such as NAND flash and DRAM that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices.

Dec 16, 2020The semiconductor manufacturing process is often split into two sub-categories. Front-end-of-the-line (FEOL) is where the transistors are created and backend-of-the-line (BEOL) is where the interconnects are formed within a device. Interconnects, the tiny wiring schemes in devices, are becoming more compact at each node, causing a resistance-capacitance (RC) delay in chips. In a device, there
