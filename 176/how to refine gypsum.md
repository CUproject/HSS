They refine a high-grade lithium output using water that can be returned and re-used. The steps generally include concentrating a brine, chemical conversion steps to change the lithium form, washing, and final crystallization. Saltworks offers solutions for every step, including comprehensive "concentrate, refine, and convert" packages.

## Should You Use Gypsum for Soil? | The Family Handyman
Dec 2, 2021Gypsum may seem like a miracle solution for soil, if what you need is a miracle. If your clay soil is high in sodium and the sodium has replaced other minerals, like magnesium or calcium, the soil will separate or disperse into fine particles that stick to your boots and tools. Luckily, gypsum makes soil less sticky.

## Will Gypsum Improve Clay Soil? - Garden Myths
Jul 9, 2021Gypsum Improves the Structure of Clay. In sodic soil, the sodium ions disrupt the clay structure. The soil drains poorly, is sticky when wet, hard when dry, and contains very little air for plant roots. In such a situation, the calcium in gypsum knocks the sodium ions off the clay and replaces them with calcium ions.
