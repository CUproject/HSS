An optimal hopper size should be at least 50-55 lbs. The reasoning behind this is this, if your hopper is 40 lbs and a bag of pellets is 40 lbs, you can only add a full bag of pellets when the stove is completely empty. Additionally, if you get a batch of low density pellets (pellets that occupy more volume by weight) having that extra 15 or so
