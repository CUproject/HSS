It is naturally found as fairly pure silicon dioxide and as silicates. The silicon dioxide is found as huge deposits of quartzite or quartz sand. Moreover, many rocks contain quartz crystals.

Fabrication of quartz crystal cantilever devices is a four-step process based on microfabrication techniques. The process starts with shaping the quartz surface, and then metal deposition for electrodes follows it. After removing the silicone, the cantilever is released from SOI substrate eliminating SiO2 between silicon and quartz.
