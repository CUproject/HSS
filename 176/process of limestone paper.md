## Lithography process (video) | Printmaking | Khan Academy
Lithography, from the Greek for "stone printing," is an intricate printmaking process that revolves around grease and water resisting one another. An artist will draw with a greasy material on a lithographic stone, and then chemically treat the stone to etch the drawing into the stone, which can then be inked to produce many impressions on paper.

## What is Quicklime and How is it Made? - Science Struck
This is the process where the limestone is heated to a temperature above 1,472ÂºF for decarbonation, i.e., removal of carbon dioxide in gaseous form, to produce quicklime. Almost half of the limestone's weight is lost as carbon dioxide. The kiln contains entry points for fuel, air, and the raw material - limestone.

## Does crushed limestone hardenfo
If you just get crushed limestone it's going to be super dusty. The resulting floor is going to be a bear to clean, something to keep in mind if you intend to have the public using it and dropping their little bits of trash all over. Personally, I'd probably put down a rough wood floor. It will look rustic, and can be kept clean with a broom.

Stone paper is a type of paper that is made out of calcium carbonate 80% (limestone) and bio-polyethylene resin 20% (HDPE). In this case, the HDPE is used as a binder. Thereby, limestone from existing limestone quarries is being used as the raw material and processed into a fine powder.
