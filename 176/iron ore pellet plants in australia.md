## Australia's Central Eyre magnetite plans pellet plant - Argus Media
Jan 12, 2022Australian mining company Iron Road has included a 1mn-2mn t/yr iron ore pellet plant as part of its proposed 12mn t/yr Central Eyre magnetite project in South Australia. The combination production capacity will remain at 12mn t/yr, with the volume of magnetite to be determined by the final design capacity of the pellet plant.

However, in 2030, we expect sinter and pellets to comprise 67% and 18%, respectively. For two reasons, these projected burden changes are expected to result in a surge in demand for pellet feed imports into China.

Metinvest offers a range of iron ore pellets for the blast furnace process, such as non-fluxed pellets produced by Central GOK with a basicity of 0.1. and 65.5% iron content, non-fluxed pellets

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

In 1970, a high-grade iron-ore mine was opened at Pannawonica in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a 200 km (120 mi) rail line to processing facilities at Cape Lambert for which the residential township of Wickham was built. A pellet plant was built but ceased operation before 1980, following a sharp increase in the cost of diesel fuel.
