## Tissue Flotation Bath - Unilabequipments
The temperature of tissue flotation bath should be optimized depending on the sample as well as the type of paraffin used; fatty tissues, such as brain or breast tissues, require lower temperature. The optimum temperature for a tissue flotation bath is 40°C-50°C, which is 5°C-10°C below that of paraffin's melting point.
