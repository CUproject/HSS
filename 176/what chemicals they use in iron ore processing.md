The cast iron is usually extracted from its oxide ore (haematite). This process involves the following steps: 1) Concentration. The ore is crushed in jaw crushers and is broken to small pieces of about 1 inch in size. The crushed ore is concentrated by gravity separation process in which it is washed with water to remove clay, sand, etc.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Ironmaking 101 - From Ore to Iron with Blast Furnaces
A specialized type of coal, called hard coal, is used to make coke, a porous form of carbon. Coke is a reductant or a chemical that can reduce iron oxide to iron metal - especially when combined with heat and oxygen. Hard coal has high-carbon content and low ash, sulfur and phosphorus levels. Coke is made in a coking oven by heating hard coal
