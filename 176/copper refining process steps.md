In refining copper, the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities, most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.

Refining of Copper. Copper refining is a process that involves multiple steps. Usually, it starts with a copper concentrate that is smelted to produce impure copper anodes. Then the anodes are electro-refined to produce an LME Grade A copper cathode (+99.99%). One of the most important factors in the refining of copper is the control of copper

## During electrorefining of impure copper the anode is?
Answer: Electrolytic refining is the process of refining impure metals by using electricity. In this process impure metal is made as the anode and a strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of a soluble salt of the same metal is taken as the electrolyte. Example- Copper can be purified by this way.
