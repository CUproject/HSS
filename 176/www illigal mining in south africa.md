## Illegal mining - Minerals Council South Africa
In South Africa, it is illegal to be in possession of unwrought precious metal ore, platinum group metals (PGMs), gold-bearing material and rough diamonds without the required statutory authorisation. Illegal mining and organised crime are inter-related. Very often, illegal mining is spearheaded by globally connected criminal syndicates.
