## Ilmenite - Lunarpedia
Introduction. Ilmenite ( Fe Ti O 3, also known as Iron titanate, or iron titanium oxide) is a naturally occurring titanium and iron ore. It is named for the location where it was discovered, Ilmen Lake in the Ural Mountains of Russia. Ilmenite is currently the most important ore of Titanium for terrestrial production.

## Ilmenite - Virtual Museum of Molecules and Minerals
Ilmenite is a heavy, opaque mineral formed at high temperatures. It occurs in igneous rock as an accessory mineral and in sediments due to its resistance to weathering. It is mostly found in the sand and silt fractions. It can be isolated from soils or sediments with a magnet. Alteration of ilmenite yields fine-grained products, such as leucoxene.
