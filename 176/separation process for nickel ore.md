## Nickel beneficiation process - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining Technology Co 
Sep 15, 2020Nickel ore is mainly divided into copper-nickel sulfide ore and nickel oxide ore, and their beneficiation and processing methods are completely different. The most important method for beneficiation of copper-nickel sulfide ore is flotation, while magnetic separation and gravity separation are usually auxiliary beneficiation methods.

## What is the process of extracting metal from ore called?
What is ore preparation? Ore Preparation It takes multiple steps to extract the "important" element from the ore: First, the ore must be separated from unwanted rocks. Then, the minerals need to be separated out of the ore. Since most minerals are not pure metals, further separation methods are required.

Mar 29, 2021Abstract Nickel is mostly extracted from sulfide ores, however, laterite ores account for over 60 pct of all nickel resources in the world, and despite its predominance, there is no well-established process to extract nickel from such ores. Nickel in laterites is hosted in many different compounds such as oxides, hydroxides, and silicates minerals. The sulfation-roasting-leaching process has

## CNB - Beneficiation method for copper nickel sulfide ore 
The invention relates to a beneficiation method for copper nickel sulfide ore. The beneficiation method is characterized in that a beneficiation process of the method comprises the following steps of: grinding crude copper nickel ore; preferably floating copper mineral from the ground crude ore; performing copper selection on the obtained rough copper concentrate I for five times to obtain
