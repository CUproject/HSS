Ammonia production flow diagram Using the data given below, draw an information flow diagram of the process and calculate the process stream flow-rates and compositions for the production of 600 t/d ammonia.  It is the availability of carbon dioxide in such ammonia production that makes the synthesis of urea attractive. The general flow for

## Adblue urea-expeerts
AdBlue ® is a high-purity 32,5 % w/w urea solution which is used as an additional working fluid in diesel cars and trucks equipped with SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction). The composition of AdBlue ® is specified in DIN 70070. The use of such systems optimises engine performance, reduces the emission of harmful particles in exhaust.

## Flow Diagram of Urea Production Process From Ammonia and Carbon
Flow Diagram of Urea Production Process from Ammonia and Carbon-dioxide Urea is manufactured by reacting ammonia and carbon dioxide in autoclave to form ammonium carbamate. The operating temperature is 1350C and 35 atm pressure, the chemical reaction is endothermic reaction and so ammonia is maintained in excess to shift the equilibrium towards
