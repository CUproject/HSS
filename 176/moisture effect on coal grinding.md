## Moisture Content In Cement Grinding
The raw coal has moisture content between 4 - 12 % by wt. and it is dried, in conjunction with grinding, to a residual moisture content of 0.5 - 1.5 % which is suitable for firing. The fineness to which coal should be ground depends on its flammability and combustion rates which are in turn, governed by the ash and volatile matter content.

## Vertical Grinding Mill (Coal Pulverizer) Explained - saVRee
Coal pulverizers are used to dry, grind and classify. Drying is achieved as hot gas passes through the pulverizer and removes moisture from the pulverized coal. The hot gases used should have a low oxygen content, this reduces the likelihood of accidental combustion within the mill. It is possible for hot gases to be taken directly from the
