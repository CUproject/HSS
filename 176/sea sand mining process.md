3. Processing Chemicals Pollution. This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 4.

This process utilizes magnetic and float separation to remove impurities. After the sand has been washed and dried and contaminants have been removed, it is screened. In this process, sand is separated according to grain size and stockpiled for future blending. These numerous demands for sand require mining of our dunes and other sand resources.

Saline-water intrusion is another negative effect of sand mining. The consequence of mining is compounded by the effect of sea level rise. Also, any volume of sand exported from the streambeds and coastal areas is a damage to the system. Irresponsible sand mining is also a huge threat to the river banks, bridges, and nearby structures.
