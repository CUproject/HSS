## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
Jul 20, 2022Jaw crusher needs to work together with feeding equipment to complement the crushing process. You can see that the granite material is reduced by the compressive force generated by two jaw dies.  As a secondary crusher, HSI crusher can process material with a little hardness and abrasive. It is sometimes be used in primary crushing process

Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee. For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate
