## » Characteristics of Gold
Gold has another distinctive quality, which is perhaps most important to the prospector (other than its value) and that is its weight. Gold is extremely dense, one of the heaviest of all metals. The specific gravity of gold is 19.6, meaning that it weighs 19.6 times more than an equal volume or mass of pure water.

Gold ore can resemble quartz with spotty areas of gold. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, gold is commonly mixed (alloyed) with silver and other metals. The ore may, therefore, contain sulfides like arsenic, copper, iron, and silver. The ore does not commonly have visible shiny gold on the surface.
