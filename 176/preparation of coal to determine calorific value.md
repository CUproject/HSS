Calorific value is commonly determined by use of a 'Bomb Calorimeter'. In the context of Coal testing, Calorific Value

## Spent bleaching earth co-processing in cement kiln & its effect on 
Sep 14, 2022Gross Calorific Value. The gross calorific value was checked from LECO Analyser as per ASTM D(RA2021), It is 2420 Kcal/Kg . 2.2.3. Burnability test. Burnability is a measure of the ease of formation of clinker from a raw meal. Its commonly expressed with free lime in the clinker. It is used to determine the suitability of raw material

## How is coal GCV calculated? - Origin of coal
How do you calculate GCV and NCV of coal? Calculate a) Gross calorific value, moist basis b) Net calorific value, dry basis c) Net calorific value, moist basis d) Gross calorific value, dry basis using Dulong formula. = 32060.2 KJ/Kg NCV = GCV - 24.44 (9×%H + %M) = 30630.26 KJ/Kg Thus NCV = 0.955 times GCV in this case.
