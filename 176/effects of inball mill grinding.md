## effects of ball inball mill grinding
Effects of percent solids and mill loading on ball wear in. The effects of percent solids, mill loading, and grinding time on product size distribution and ball wear were studied in a laboratory ball mill for a taconite ore. Mild steel balls and HCLA steel balls were used to examine the role that ball hardness play in grinding.

##  The Effect of Ball Mill Operating Parameters on Mineral Liberation
In previous studies, the analysis of ball mill ° operating parameters and their effects on breakage phenomena has been limited to homogeneous materials. Though these ß studies have proven to be an asset in predictions of product size distributions and mill scale—up, they have not addressed the primary role of grinding, i.e. liberation. I

## A Review of Breakage Behavior in Fine Grinding by Stirred-Media Millingt
media mills, this percentage is said to be around 1%, with most of energy being wasted as heat. Neverthe­ less, the total energy input to grinding mills can often be related to the fineness of grinding. In the classical work on grinding, the fineness of the ground product, represented by some characteristic size x, has been
