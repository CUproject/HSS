## Estimated Cost to Build and Open a Recycling Plant in 2022
1. Land Requirement: $120,000 - $1,000,000. The demand of land depends on what scale your plant will operate. If you choose to operate a small scale recycling plant, then a 50 sq. feet room can also work. But if you choose a large scale recycling plant, then at least 200 to 500 sq. feet of land is required for the recycling process.

The methodological approaches concerning the evaluation of the technical construction cost of wastewater treatment plants have been discussed widely in the literature since the late 1960s. If the plants are divided by size, population served, type of wastewater and treatment, the unit costs decrease as the size of the plant increases .
