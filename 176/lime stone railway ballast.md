## Rail Track Ballast | Tarmac
Ballast is the description for the aggregate beneath the rail track. The track ballast forms the track bed that suports the rail track load and provides water drainage. Rail ballast aggregate is typically 30-50mm aggretate. Hard and tough stone is required for rail ballast. Resists the severe attrition in a railway trackbed environment.

Abstract. Railway track formations generally consist essentially of a layer of coarse aggregate, or ballast, in which the sleepers are embedded (see Fig. 12.1). The ballast may rest directly on the subgrade or, depending on the bearing capacity, on a layer of blanketing sand. The layer of ballast is intended to provide a free draining base

## Difference in types of Ballast? - Trains Magazine - Trains News Wire 
Historically, the ballast a railroad used was what was available on line, hence limestone in the south, ganite in the west, cinders or dirt anywhere, etc, as you note. As demands for a better track structure developed, many things changed. Ties got bigger, rail got heavier and the need for a good solid base to build it on got more critical.

## Ballast - Functions and Types - The Constructor
Broken stone is a widely used ballast in railways. It is obtained by crushing hard stones like granite, hard trap, quartzite etc. In lieu of broken stones, limestone and sandstone can also be used. It is suitable for high-speed railway tracks. The broken stone selected as ballast should be hard, tough and non-porous.

## What colour is ballast?.uk
On the real railway line, the ballast would have come from a local quarry so the colour would reflect this. The colour will mostly epend on the type of stone common ones are limestone and granite, with colours varying from white to grey and brown.. The colour will also vary over time.Ballast that was laid a long time ago will be heavily weathered while freshly laid ballast will be more vibrant.

Railway ballast that has lost its geotechnical properties and is no longer able to fully support the rail track or provide adequate drainage has to be renewed. However, rather than sending the old ballast to landfill, much of this spent material can be turned into valuable recycled products by an effective washing and screening process.

Railroad ballast is produced by first blasting solid rock from the quarry face. It is then crushed and screened to produce an open graded product. This differs from the well graded products, such as concrete aggregate, in that the stones within the product are all close to the same size. This reduces the effect of the filling in of the voids between the stones by smaller particles.
