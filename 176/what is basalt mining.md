## Basalt fibers as functional additives in coating of textiles
In the presented study, basalt fibers are used as additives in polymer coatings applied onto textiles substrates. As basalt fibers, short fibers with diameters of around 13 µm and with lengths in the range of 0.16-4 mm are used. As the textile substrate, a cotton fabric is used. The polymer coatings are based on acrylate or polyurethane. As a further coating additive, the silicate compound

## Making Minerals-How Growing Rocks Can Help Reduce Carbon Emissions
Basalt is a hard, black volcanic rock that is being considered as targets for storing carbon via a process known as mineralization.  If mining is required, the cost increases significantly. Based on limited results from a few pilot projects, carbon mineralization in deep underground basaltic formations could be around $30 per metric ton of

## Basalt: where it is mined, how it is used, properties and features 
Basalt is melted in a furnace at a temperature of 1200° C, which makes it an excellent raw material for popular stone casting (making fireplaces, stair treads and other cast forms). Basalt filaments, which are formed after the rock is heated in the furnace and sprayed, are used as thermal and sound insulation (stone or basalt wool).
