Three of the processes introduced above have made great strides in solving these problems for the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite: The GEOCOATâ¢ Process - A heap leaching process that is capable of bioleaching copper concentrates. It does this by coating the concentrate slurry onto a support rock, or substrate material, and stacking this coated material in a bioxidation heap.

## Beginners guide to thickeners - Metso Outotec
Beginners guide to thickeners. Thickening is a process where a slurry or solid-liquid mixture is separated to a dense slurry containing most of the solids and an overflow of essentially clear water (or liquor in leaching processes). The driving force for the separation is gravitational, where the differences in phase densities drive the

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.
