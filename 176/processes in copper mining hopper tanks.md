Three of the processes introduced above have made great strides in solving these problems for the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite: The GEOCOAT™ Process - A heap leaching process that is capable of bioleaching copper concentrates. It does this by coating the concentrate slurry onto a support rock, or substrate material, and stacking this coated material in a bioxidation heap.

## Beginners guide to thickeners - Metso Outotec
Beginners guide to thickeners. Thickening is a process where a slurry or solid-liquid mixture is separated to a dense slurry containing most of the solids and an overflow of essentially clear water (or liquor in leaching processes). The driving force for the separation is gravitational, where the differences in phase densities drive the
