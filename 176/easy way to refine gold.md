## How you can Refine Gold With Nitric Acidity - ScienceBriefss
Sep 24, 2021It is possible to refine gold without the use of large-scale, expensive chemical procedures. The process involves first adding nitric acid to gold, then adding hydrochloric or muriatic acid. After allowing this mixture to sit, it is filtered to remove contaminants, then treated to neutralize the acids in the solution.
