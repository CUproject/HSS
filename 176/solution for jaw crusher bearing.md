## Jaw Crusher Lubrication Knowledge Analysis | - DC Velocity
Since the large and medium jaw crusher bearings and the eccentric shaft are pressure cycle lubrication, when the oil pump fails, the jaw crusher needs to swing the power for 15-20 minutes to stop, so it is necessary to press the oil pump to apply oil to the bearing. Keeping it lubricated, there is no accident of burning the bearing.

The actual crusher can be in the form of a cone, gyratory, impact, jaw, etc. - type machine. Common to all crushers is the requirement for lubrication, be it oil lubrication (e.g. for gear boxes) or grease (e.g. for bearings). The pure nature of crushing rocks produces many possible issues and considerations to tend with on a daily basis.
