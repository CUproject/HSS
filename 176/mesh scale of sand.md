## Mesh Sizing Chart for strainers - Valvesonline
Mesh Sizing Chart for strainers. Mesh size for strainers is usually denominated in mm or microns however it can also be assigned a mesh number (which is number of holes per inch). A micron is one millionth of a meter. There are some basic references of size of mesh but vary according to such things as heat, pressure and the nature of the material.

## What is the size of coarse sand, medium sand and fine sand?
Natural sand: rock particle with the particle size < 5 mm, formed by natural conditions, and divided into river sand, sea sand, mountain sand according to its original place. The thickness of sand is divided into 4 levels on the basis of fineness modulus. Coarse sand: its fineness modulus is 3.7-3.1, the average particle size is over 0.5 mm.

## Mesh (scale)
e. Mesh is a measurement of particle size often used in determining the particle-size distribution of a granular material. For example, a sample from a truckload of peanuts may be placed atop a mesh with 5 mm openings. When the mesh is shaken, small broken pieces and dust pass through the mesh while whole peanuts are retained on the mesh.

## Finding sand and mesh size for a slow sand filter | Rain water 
Woven Construction, 30 Mesh, 0.0120″ Wire, .0213″ Opening, 48.0000" Width . The first mounds, in row 1 of the play sand, mortar sand and mason's sand columns; are the very coarse pieces mixed with smaller pieces that really prevent a slow sand filter from working.

## Which green sand properties should you control per molding equipment 
Composition of green sand molding mixture for iron foundries typically consists of 100 parts silica sand, 8 parts bentonite clay and other additions like carbon ( 0,3 parts ) or cereals and 3 % water content. It's called " green" because the mold strength is developed with mechanical (compression) stress; not by a chemical reaction nor heat.

## Sand Control Screens Application and Selection
Once the large sand entering into the bore, it can decrease the production or even make the drilling equipment unworkable. Established in 1990, Hebei Hightop Metal Mesh Co., Ltd. has set up a professional research & development team. We will analyze the formation sand and recommend appropriate sand screen for your specific well application.
