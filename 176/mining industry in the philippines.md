Mining industry in the Philippines. THE Philippines is the fifth most mineral-rich country in the world for gold, nickel, copper, and chromite. It is home to the largest copper-gold deposit in the world. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) has estimated that the country has an estimated $840 billion worth of untapped mineral wealth, as of 2012.
