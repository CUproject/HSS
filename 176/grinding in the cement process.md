## What Does " Two Grinding And One Firing" Mean In Cement Production
7 days agoCement grinding. The fine grinding of cement clinker usually adopts the circular flow grinding process (ie closed circuit operation system). In order to prevent dust from flying in production, cement plants are equipped with dust collection equipment. Electric precipitators, bag filters and cyclones are commonly used dust collection equipment

However, if the floor is basically in a good state then a power trowel can be used to grind away the micro roughness and afterwards polishing can begin with increasing finer grades of grits.. The grinding and polishing process with a power trowel creates a good deal of slurry - water with particles of concrete dust in suspension.

## How Cement Is Made
The heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns, a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency. After the clinker is cooled, cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone. Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix

A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide. Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early.

3. Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.
