## Cement Manufacturing Process - Sanghi cement
Apr 29, 2021Cement manufacturing process involves various raw materials and processes. Cement is a greenish grey coloured powder, made of calcined mixtures of clay and limestone. When mixed with water becomes a hard and strong building material. It was first introduced by a British stone mason, Joseph Aspdin in 1824, who cooked cement in his kitchen.
