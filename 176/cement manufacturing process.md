Apr 29, 2021Cement manufacturing process involves various raw materials and processes. Cement is a greenish grey coloured powder, made of calcined mixtures of clay and limestone. When mixed with water becomes a hard and strong building material. It was first introduced by a British stone mason, Joseph Aspdin in 1824, who cooked cement in his kitchen.

The wet process method is manufacturing raw materials slurry with 32%-40% water content. Wet process method's advantage is that its good fluidity of raw materials slurry makes more even mixed materials and produces high-quality clinker.

Cement Manufacturing Process Phase II: Proportioning, Blending & Grinding. The raw materials from quarry are now routed in plant laboratory where, they are analyzed and proper proportioning of limestone and clay are making possible before the beginning of grinding. Generally, limestone is 80% and remaining 20% is the clay.

## Manufacturing process
The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded onto dumpers
