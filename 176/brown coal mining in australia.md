## Australian coal mining - Workplace Health and Safety (Part Two)
Jan 14, 2021The Australian coal mining landscape is predominantly driven by surface or opencast mining with about 65% of coal production attributed to opencast mining methods. In Australia, brown coal is typically mined in the southern part, while black coal is mainly found in the basins of New South Wales and Queensland.

## Impact of Shocks on Australian Coal Mining | SpringerLink
The black and brown coal mining industry at present contributes 8.4 % to the Australian GDP, and its share in Australian GDP has increased by more than 3 % over the past decade (ABS 2010). While brown coal is used solely for domestic purposes, black coal is one of the most valued Australian export commodities.

## How Is Coal Mined? | Bravus Mining & Resources
Jun 24, 2021Coal is mined in Australia using leading mining techniques and technologies. According to Geoscience Australia, almost 80 per cent of Australian coal is extracted from open-cut mines, where up to 90 per cent of the rock can be recovered from the seam. [8] Worldwide, about 40 per cent of coal-mining uses open-cut techniques.

## Why is Australia still opening coal mines? | The Lighthouse
Old energy: Australia is opening coal mines, while countries such as Germany are closing them down. And yet, while the rest of the world is looking at transitioning away from fossil-fuels such as coal to renewables (Germany is in the process of closing down all its 84 coal-fired power plants), Australia is still opening new mines.

In, Australia produced 57.8 million tonnes of brown coal. This is about 10 per cent of the global output. The Australian output of brown coal has been consistent and, most likely, will remain consistent, as it is produced entirely for the local market. The Australian resources of brown coal are estimated at over 400 billion tonnes.

In Western Australia, the coal was discovered in 1846, found on the Murray River. In 1889, brown coal was found at Kuntha Hill South Australia, and on the Great Northern railway line. The Coal Mining began in 1799 and the first export of Australian coal took place in 1801 to India. Australia's black coals range from Permian to Jurassic in age.

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
Mining safety. The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.
