##  History of the Machine-Made Glass Marble
By designing equipment that automated the marble-making process, glass imitation agates could be produced faster than those manufactured by Elias Greiner Vetters Shon. On October 24, 1905 the M.F. Christensen and Son Company received a patent from the United States Government for the invention of the glass- marble- making- machine.

## Marble Restoration a Four-Step Process - Love Marble
While every job is a little bit different, basic marble restoration is a four-step process. The first step is grinding down the marble surface. This step, also known as lippage removal or flattening, removes all roughness and ledges and makes the surface perfectly flat. It's also when most scratches and stains are removed.
