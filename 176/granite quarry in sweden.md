Granite Quarry was originally named Woodville in the late 1800's and was officially changed by the N.C. General Assembly to Woodsides on March 7, 1901. This name was derived from a family of Woodsides who lived in the community. The first post office was established under this name in 1891 with Joseph F. Wiley serving as the first postmaster.
